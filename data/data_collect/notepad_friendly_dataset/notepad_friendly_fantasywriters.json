To check out the first contest, [here\u2019s our winners announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1bftnf7/official_december_solstice_2023_writing_contest/)! A few minor adjustments have been made to the format and rules of the competition, which I\u2019ll get to very soon. But first\u2026 the prompt!\n\n# Write a story about a \u201cSabotutor\u201d (a Mentor who intentionally trains their student(s) incorrectly) whose scheme could be spoiled after their poor guidance leads to an unexpected discovery.\n\nAdditional Optional Prompts:\n\n- Include an animal companion. \n- Write a sentence at least five words long where every word starts with the same letter.\n- Make your POV character trip and fall.\n\n# Rules\n\nThere is a slight change here: **We are reducing the required word count to 2,000-3,000 words.** This is to make the contest easier for both the authors and judges to meet their deadlines. \n\n- The submission must be a Google Doc. 12pt Georgia, 1-inch margins, 1.5-spaced, left-aligned. The title should be in the center-top with the author's name directly below. No fancy type-setting embellishments. The only thing that should stand out is the content of your story. [Example.](https://i.imgur.com/2aPL5Ve.png)\n- Word count should be **between 2,000 and 3,000 words.**\n- The genre must be speculative fiction. (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, magical realism, etc.)\n- Keep it PG-13. (e.g., no graphic descriptions of violence or sex, etc.)\n- **No plagiarism. No A.I.-generated content.** If found in violation of this rule, you will be immediately disqualified and banned from participating in future contests.\n\n# Your Rights\n\nAll submissions to this contest belong to their respective authors. You are free to share your story however you like whenever you like, before or after the submission deadline. We\u2019re literally just a subreddit and will not be taking any action against you for distributing your story how you want to.\n\nWith that said, by submitting your story to our contest, you are giving us permission to also share, distribute, and judge the content, with all credit to you.\n\nYou also have the right to use your Reddit username or a pseudonym as the \"Author\" if you don\u2019t want to share your real name on the anonymous internet.\n\n# Judging\n\nThis section will also be modified with a less strict rubric for judging. Rather than giving a numerical rating scale for each story\u2019s concept, prose, plot, and characters, judges will instead choose their top four entries and be asked to give justifications. Again, this makes the judging process much simpler. \n\nIf you're interested in being judge (and you are not planning to participate) you must be a member of our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7nu2Zz8StN), and you should DM me at @Page2000 with a request.\n\nLike last time, we will have a Reader\u2019s Choice Thread. However, the comment section will be unlocked this time so that people can give comments/critiques on the stories they've read. I originally had the thread locked to enable more unbiased reads, but several participants from the previous contest asked if there could be a way to receive feedback, and this seemed like an obvious solution that would also encourage engagement. \n\nThe awards will be as follows:\n\n- First Place: A special yellow flair.\n- Reader\u2019s Choice: A special green flair.\n- Runners-up (3): A special blue flair.\n\nIf the same author wins multiple awards, their flare color will be by order of the following priority: yellow, green, then blue. This goes without saying, but if you choose to participate in the competition, there is a chance you may not win anything at all.

[Example.](https://i.imgur.com/2aPL5Ve.png)\n- Word count should be **between 2,000 and 3,000 words.**\n- The genre must be speculative fiction. (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, magical realism, etc.)\n- Keep it PG-13. (e.g., no graphic descriptions of violence or sex, etc.)\n- **No plagiarism. No A.I.-generated content.** If found in violation of this rule, you will be immediately disqualified and banned from participating in future contests.\n\n# Your Rights\n\nAll submissions to this contest belong to their respective authors. You are free to share your story however you like whenever you like, before or after the submission deadline. We\u2019re literally just a subreddit and will not be taking any action against you for distributing your story how you want to.\n\nWith that said, by submitting your story to our contest, you are giving us permission to also share, distribute, and judge the content, with all credit to you.\n\nYou also have the right to use your Reddit username or a pseudonym as the \"Author\" if you don\u2019t want to share your real name on the anonymous internet.\n\n# Judging\n\nThis section will also be modified with a less strict rubric for judging. Rather than giving a numerical rating scale for each story\u2019s concept, prose, plot, and characters, judges will instead choose their top four entries and be asked to give justifications. Again, this makes the judging process much simpler. \n\nIf you're interested in being judge (and you are not planning to participate) you must be a member of our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7nu2Zz8StN), and you should DM me at @Page2000 with a request.\n\nLike last time, we will have a Reader\u2019s Choice Thread. However, the comment section will be unlocked this time so that people can give comments/critiques on the stories they've read. I originally had the thread locked to enable more unbiased reads, but several participants from the previous contest asked if there could be a way to receive feedback, and this seemed like an obvious solution that would also encourage engagement. \n\nThe awards will be as follows:\n\n- First Place: A special yellow flair.\n- Reader\u2019s Choice: A special green flair.\n- Runners-up (3): A special blue flair.\n\nIf the same author wins multiple awards, their flare color will be by order of the following priority: yellow, green, then blue. This goes without saying, but if you choose to participate in the competition, there is a chance you may not win anything at all.

That said, they can still be of use as reference.\n\nThis is my current webnovel & comic process (as of 2024):\n\n1. First I discover an idea. If its good enough I put in my story idea list and number it along with any idea notes for it.\n\n2. Then I go through and think of all the potential routes I can take this idea. What's going to be the direction and goal of the story (if any at all). Carrying out any essential worldbuilding, such as characters, locations, power systems, etc. 9 times out of 10, it\u2019ll my personal genre of Heretical Fantasy (named it that because it kinda goes against some methods of professional writing, plus it just sounded funny to me).\n\n3. The there\u2019s the layout. I do mine by each chapter for my webnovels and comic projects. I personally can put as little as three words for each chapter point and still be able to turn that chapter into 4k+ words (or 40+ pages for comics), but it really depends on your memory. I think its best to always include at least the main focus of the chapter. But sometimes it can be good to note every point for a chapter (or scene) so you know whether you have enough content or at least all the necessary content.\n\n4. Then I start writing or scripting (if comics). This is how I organize my [scripts](https://imgur.com/a/Jrewgwo). This is how organize my text for my [webnovels](https://imgur.com/a/3iDgC2i). And [this](https://imgur.com/a/PNFjYRY) is from a cross fan project I did. So sometimes organization can be different. \n\nAs far as first paragraphs for webnovels I like to start with detailing an area or aspect/concept, and then slowly drift into its relation to the character, whether it's in relation to what he is currently doing, his role in the story, or even his casual life.\n\nHow I like to start pages is with a view of the area the first scene takes place. Then to lead into what's happening, either an action-fueled event like this from my [Firebirds ch 0](https://voidedg.com/2023/08/21/issue-0/). Or something as simple but semi-foreshadowing as the protag farming plants that\u2019ll ultimately be used to help solve a food shortage in the future, like this [page](https://imgur.com/a/FBg4UFk) from the comic adaptation of my \u201cSeed of the Void\u201d webnovel.\n\n5. Then there\u2019s editing. I myself edit while I\u2019m writing and after each chapter. I personally use [Grammarly](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grammarly-ai-writing-keyboard/id1158877342) to speed up this process, since sometimes while editing I get so into the story that it distracts me. I\u2019m also on the dictionary.com app daily as well, so my arsenal of words is rather large. Since I\u2019m my only target audience, the goal is for me to like it, thus I do not get proofreads from others or anything of the sort as it is not necessary for me. \n\nTips: I recommend watching tons of shows, both animated & live, to study dialogue. But also watch random podcasts, and just pay attention to real conversations in society, not in a creepy way of course. Just to understand what sounds natural and what doesn't.

For one thing, cancer is a slow disease. It could takes years for anyone to figure out that a particular factory was making people sick. Once you figure that out, you have to eliminate all the other possible factors in the placng that could be causing the cancer. Which would not be easy, on account of 19th Century factories being packed to the gills with carcinogens. To figure out that the metal the machines are made of you'd have to both know what radioactivity is and figure out that radioactivity can be harmful. In real life it took a depressingly long time to put that together. \n\nEven if you figure all that out, it might not matter. The Industrial Revolution is packed to the gills with stories of companies knowingly putting their workers in danger while depriving them of adequate safety equipment. The Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster is a particularly grim example. People kept taking the jobs because the economy sucked and they had no choice. When your options are \"die of cancer in ten years\" or \"let my family starve to death this week,\" most people opt for the former.\n\nWe even have an example involving radiation. The girls who painted the watch hands with radium paint so it would glow in the dark all ending up suffering horrible, deforming bone cancer.

Cancer kills slowly, and the process would have been mysterious and opaque to people in that kind of setting. Look back on our historical understanding of cancer: some people believed it to be the work of the devil.

Just five or six people. The objective of this group will be to  create a community, in where we can share our work,  and critique it through weekly meetings. I want to create a support group for each other where we can get to know each other. \n\nWe are looking for people who are serious about their craft, and want to one day publish their work. We  love to write fantasy and sci-fi, and we would love to read your work. \n\nIn order to comply with the sub's rules, here is an epigraph I wroke for one of the stories I am writing. For context, this should read as something rather dramatic, almost melodramatic as its a journal entry. The church that I mention reveres no god. And no, its not warhammer fan fic, I just like the holy roman empire. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notebook 1. 1055 A.A. Ultrich\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*1055 A.A. Ultrich*\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Every street in Ultrich was shaken by an invisible struggle, a war between the city and the sky. The clouds were celebrated at first, and people rejoiced in their early arrival. Years of late rains had reduced the city's food supply and population. Ultrich had once been a proud Free City of The Empire but now it did not have the population to maintain an Elector at Court. We were too far from the capital to matter but too close to be able to join a Free State. Ultrich was just another forgotten city in our decaying empire.*\u00a0\n\n*Without outside help, the city\u00a0brined\u00a0on its misery, becoming a shadow of itself. Colourful clothes greyed out one mend at a time, the elements stained and chipped wall paint and moods alike. As the city darkened, so did the sky. The clouds were celebrated at first, but the rain never came. Misery grew into desperation, and in the right hands, desperation is one whisper, one sophism from being turned into hate.\u00a0The Church\u00a0had\u00a0celebrated the clouds as everyone else,\u00a0as\u00a0their arrival coincided with Ascension day.\u00a0They proclaimed the occasion as a sign, with the cardinal even proclaiming an end to the city's decline in his annual\u00a0speech*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0*\" It has been one thousand and fifty-five years since He ascended and showed us The Path. One thousand years since we fought at his side to claim our freedom from the dark forces that want us slaved! But make no mistake, those same dark forces are still out there, waiting, testing us, and driving us to heresy! But I say: let them test us! Their trials only serve to make us stronger! To remind us that only those who fight for freedom deserve it! Humanity will prevail! And you, all of you, are the perfect example of this. Years of suffering have not been enough to drive you from the path! Today marks the end of our trials! We must welcome the rain with celebration.\"*\n\n*The\u00a0words of the cardinal\u00a0spread through the city\u00a0as\u00a0a wave of color. Poor and rich alike wore their best clothes, laughed and danced together in an attempt to lure the liquid gold out of the clouds. But nature has never cared about us and that day proved no different.*\u00a0\n\n*I will not bore you with more details, but The Church did not appreciate that reality did not bend to\u00a0their\u00a0wishes. When its authority came into question, it turned to its forever enemy. Those that follow\u00a0the Old Ways, those\u00a0that\u00a0thought differently, those\u00a0that\u00a0dare to dream. All of them,\u00a0heretics to the Church.*\u00a0\n\n*They came in the dark of night, ransacking houses, killing many on the spot. The rest were not so lucky. Dragged into the public square, stripped naked and shackled to a pole. They whipped and tortured them, and forced confessions of heresy were drawn of each one before they were summarily executed. Only one did not break. His name was Belak. The cardinal himself tried to break him.*\n\n*\" Admit your sins, we\u00a0know you follow the old\u00a0ways,\u00a0with your concoctions and potions\", the cardinal\u00a0yelled\" Attempts at Magic are what they are.\"*\n\n\u00a0*\" I am a doctor. I provide nothing but herbs and water,\" Belak calmly said, his eyes piercing the crowd. Crimson lines crossed his naked body where the teeth of the whipped had met the flesh. But his voice did not recognize the pain, did not recognize the wild crowd leeching off his pain.\" You may draw every single drop of blood from my body before you draw a lie from my lips.\"*\n\n*The cardinal's face shined with fury.\" Look around your heretic pig; look at the hungered faces; this is the work of your Dark Gods. Admit\u00a0it,\u00a0so this land can finally heal.\" But the cardinal's words fell on deaf ears. Belak had met the gaze of a skinny kid in the crowd. Their entire world was reduced to an exchange of glassy eyes. Belak met his end without screaming or flinching. He did not break the kid's gaze.*\n\n*Later that night the kid dug a grave.

Just five or six people. The objective of this group will be to  create a community, in where we can share our work,  and critique it through weekly meetings. I want to create a support group for each other where we can get to know each other. \n\nWe are looking for people who are serious about their craft, and want to one day publish their work. We  love to write fantasy and sci-fi, and we would love to read your work. \n\nIn order to comply with the sub's rules, here is an epigraph I wroke for one of the stories I am writing. For context, this should read as something rather dramatic, almost melodramatic as its a journal entry. The church that I mention reveres no god. And no, its not warhammer fan fic, I just like the holy roman empire. \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notebook 1. 1055 A.A. Ultrich\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*1055 A.A. Ultrich*\u00a0\u00a0\n\n*Every street in Ultrich was shaken by an invisible struggle, a war between the city and the sky. The clouds were celebrated at first, and people rejoiced in their early arrival. Years of late rains had reduced the city's food supply and population. Ultrich had once been a proud Free City of The Empire but now it did not have the population to maintain an Elector at Court. We were too far from the capital to matter but too close to be able to join a Free State. Ultrich was just another forgotten city in our decaying empire.*\u00a0\n\n*Without outside help, the city\u00a0brined\u00a0on its misery, becoming a shadow of itself. Colourful clothes greyed out one mend at a time, the elements stained and chipped wall paint and moods alike. As the city darkened, so did the sky. The clouds were celebrated at first, but the rain never came. Misery grew into desperation, and in the right hands, desperation is one whisper, one sophism from being turned into hate.\u00a0The Church\u00a0had\u00a0celebrated the clouds as everyone else,\u00a0as\u00a0their arrival coincided with Ascension day.\u00a0They proclaimed the occasion as a sign, with the cardinal even proclaiming an end to the city's decline in his annual\u00a0speech*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0*\" It has been one thousand and fifty-five years since He ascended and showed us The Path. One thousand years since we fought at his side to claim our freedom from the dark forces that want us slaved! But make no mistake, those same dark forces are still out there, waiting, testing us, and driving us to heresy! But I say: let them test us! Their trials only serve to make us stronger! To remind us that only those who fight for freedom deserve it! Humanity will prevail! And you, all of you, are the perfect example of this. Years of suffering have not been enough to drive you from the path! Today marks the end of our trials! We must welcome the rain with celebration.\"*\n\n*The\u00a0words of the cardinal\u00a0spread through the city\u00a0as\u00a0a wave of color. Poor and rich alike wore their best clothes, laughed and danced together in an attempt to lure the liquid gold out of the clouds. But nature has never cared about us and that day proved no different.*\u00a0\n\n*I will not bore you with more details, but The Church did not appreciate that reality did not bend to\u00a0their\u00a0wishes. When its authority came into question, it turned to its forever enemy. Those that follow\u00a0the Old Ways, those\u00a0that\u00a0thought differently, those\u00a0that\u00a0dare to dream. All of them,\u00a0heretics to the Church.*\u00a0\n\n*They came in the dark of night, ransacking houses, killing many on the spot. The rest were not so lucky. Dragged into the public square, stripped naked and shackled to a pole. They whipped and tortured them, and forced confessions of heresy were drawn of each one before they were summarily executed. Only one did not break. His name was Belak. The cardinal himself tried to break him.*\n\n*\" Admit your sins, we\u00a0know you follow the old\u00a0ways,\u00a0with your concoctions and potions\", the cardinal\u00a0yelled\" Attempts at Magic are what they are.\"*\n\n\u00a0*\" I am a doctor. I provide nothing but herbs and water,\" Belak calmly said, his eyes piercing the crowd. Crimson lines crossed his naked body where the teeth of the whipped had met the flesh. But his voice did not recognize the pain, did not recognize the wild crowd leeching off his pain.\" You may draw every single drop of blood from my body before you draw a lie from my lips.\"*\n\n*The cardinal's face shined with fury.\" Look around your heretic pig; look at the hungered faces; this is the work of your Dark Gods. Admit\u00a0it,\u00a0so this land can finally heal.\" But the cardinal's words fell on deaf ears. Belak had met the gaze of a skinny kid in the crowd. Their entire world was reduced to an exchange of glassy eyes. Belak met his end without screaming or flinching. He did not break the kid's gaze.*\n\n*Later that night the kid dug a grave. He did not have a body to bury, as heretics had to be burnt. But\u00a0he had to bury something, do something. So he buried Belak's wedding band, both bands now united under the ground. And as he did the storm finally broke out.\u00a0The rain poured down, mocking his tears. The kid wailed at the cruel irony.*\u00a0\n\n*\"Your father was a friend\"\u00a0A deep voice rumbled behind the kid. \"There is no future for you here, come with me if you want to learn.\" The man said as he reached out with open hands.*\n\n*I had only seen men like this in Church paintings, his mahogany skin contrasted with his purple and golden robes.

I do not care if a map is at the end of the book, but it being at the front is a turn-off for me *personally*. But I can't really read maps.

After all, flying is a *massive* advantage for the dragon as it's not affected by terrain and it can be in the air so it can spot a much wider area. All this method would do is delay the dragon then once it takes flight again... now it's *pissed* and *significantly* more dangerous than when it had its breath attack. If the wing was torn or damaged, then you'd at least have a reason as the dragon can't just fly up again in 5-10 minutes... but unless the spell was likely to damage the wing, then the party would probably be smart enough *not* to use that spell. Especially if the dragon didn't know they were there yet... downing it would make most dragons in media single-mindedly hunt down its attackers in vengeance.

I\u2019m used to the mechanical aspect of dragon fire being a product of some gland or organ in their esophagus that can inject/ignite fuel in their breath.

Is their natural biome somewhere dry, or totally without large bodies of water?

There was a shootout at the club, and they have taken her away. Before you ask, Mom is a vampire. She\u2019d been through worse. I suppose that raises some immediate questions. Let me start over.\n\nI never knew my real parents. I\u2019m pretty sure mom killed them both, but I never asked. If you think it\u2019s strange I never asked, that\u2019s because you don\u2019t know me very well. Mom decided to keep me. Maybe it was a trace of human emotion, or perhaps simple utility, but you know what I think? I think she was curious. She found a baby, and decided it would be interesting to raise it. Mom\u2019s hobbies were always a bit peculiar.\n\nMom is minor nobility in her clan. Owns a night club, the kind that\u2019s fancy in the front and dirty in the back. You know the deal. I grew up fast, as is usually the case when one spends their childhood among creatures of the night. Mom being nobility meant I met some fancy people, so there\u2019s that. Mom being a vampire, I came face to face with death a few times before I even turned ten. I was always a smart kid, and being smart as a kid means mastering one\u2019s home environment. I learned to talk to all kinds of people: politicians, business men, prostitutes, drug dealers, hit-men, you get the deal. Then there were the undersiders: warlocks, demons, anyone who might be friendly with a vampire.  \n\nSpeaking of vampires. You\u2019ve read the books, you\u2019ve seen the movies, you probably already feel confused about what is true and what is not. Believe me, even I got some of it confused on occasion. When you have to remember details about multiple supernatural species, all while being bombarded by stories that each tell a different tale \u2013 in short, I get it. I\u2019ll try not to make it too hard on you, tell you what you need to know and assume you already know the rest. I promise I won\u2019t make it long; I just prefer not to pause later in the middle of the good stuff just to tell you something boring. I know it\u2019s unconventional and therefore a bad choice, but that\u2019s my way of telling you I don\u2019t care all that much what you think of me.  \n\nSo, vampires. Immortal, beautiful, drink human blood. You knew all that. What you might not have known: they don\u2019t have a human psyche. So no \u201cI\u2019m a vampire but actually I\u2019m a person just like you\u201d, sorry. Vampires are considered psychopaths by many human warlocks, but that\u2019s not entirely true. Vampires have their own psychology, which happens to be different from our human one. They are built to manipulate us into entering dark alleys and getting our blood sucked. They are intelligent, which made it possible for them to coexist with human magical authorities. They won\u2019t kill their prey unless they have to; but that is only because it\u2019s part of the agreement. Still, most of them aren\u2019t interesting in killing \u2013 it\u2019s all about the blood. Blood is feeding and fucking at the same time, though no human can imagine what it feels like for them. They can have regular sex, and some claim they do enjoy it, but vampires are a bunch of liars. Truth is, sex is only a tool for them. They get nothing out of it. The easiest way to tell that they\u2019re lying is if they act human: they look sad? Lies. They look happy? Lies. They look alien and incomprehensible? Probably also lies, but there\u2019s a small chance they are showing you their real self. Vampires aren\u2019t as sociable as humans, but they do have their own societies. So naturally, they have conventions for behaving among themselves. Though they are lying to each other constantly, too. You know how when wolf cubs play-fight with each other it\u2019s actually how they train to fight and hunt? Young vampires play-lie to each other as training for manipulating humans.  \n\nMom could have manipulated me into anything she wanted, which is why it\u2019s so strange to me that she chose to tell me the truth. How do I know it\u2019s the truth, you might ask. Maybe I was manipulated after all. What can I tell you? If I am manipulated, obviously I\u2019d be blind to it. That\u2019s how it works. But manipulation tends to fail an intelligent investigation, because reality tends to not care what your parents chose to tell you. Most of what Mom told me about the underside I have verified for myself. Could she have hidden a huge lie among the truths? Definitely. But honestly, I don\u2019t care. The most important thing you need to know about me and mom is this: She raised me with all the love a boy could ask for from his mother. If there\u2019s a secret plan, I just don\u2019t care. I owe her my life, and would gladly give it away for her sake. Human mothers \u2013 healthy ones \u2013 can\u2019t help but love their children. My mother cannot feel love, and yet she acted like she did, because she knew that\u2019s what a human child needs in order to grow strong and healthy. Do you get it now?\n\nBack to vampire 101: silver can work, as it works on most undersiders, but unlikely to kill a vampire. A wooden stake through their heart will paralyze them, but only because it prevents their heart from healing. A plastic or metal stake would work just as well. Yes, they have a pulse. They aren\u2019t dead and aren\u2019t undead \u2013 they\u2019re alive. That\u2019s the part that pisses people off the most, but sorry, I\u2019m not making the rules here. They are cold to the touch, but most can learn to control their temperature. Garlic kind of works against them; it doesn\u2019t hurt them, but they really hate the stuff. Crosses will work if a warlock uses them to focus his magic, but so would any object with symbolic importance. Sunlight kills them rather quickly. It burns them \u2013 not in the burst-into-flames kind of way, more like in the pale-skinned-guy-was-left-in-the-desert-sun-for-too-long kind of way, only they die in a matter of minutes under direct exposure.\n\nMe? I\u2019m not important. I\u2019m a twenty-eight year old guy raised by a vampire. I\u2019m a regular human as far as I can tell, but you know what? Humans are the masters of adaptation, and I had to adapt to a very strange environment. I can feel anything a human can feel; but I was raised by a vampire incapable of human feelings; but she had mastered the play-act of human emotion, and raised me like a loving human mother. Are you confused yet? Imagine what I had to go through. That\u2019s what was always missing for me in stories of the supernatural \u2013 otherworldly beings were always either human beings with superpowers or killers with the psychological complexity of an alligator. Real magical creatures \u2013 a stupid name by the way, which is why I prefer \u2018undersiders\u2019 \u2013 each have their own unique psychology. They are often intelligent, complex, and yet almost alien. I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll be able to give you an accurate representation of that, as a human being cannot truly comprehend a consciousness other than his own \u2013 and I\u2019m still human. But unlike all those stories you have read, I grew up with these creatures. So I have some advantage.\n\nI left home when I was fifteen. Haven\u2019t been back since. I traveled, I worked, I slept around, got into fights, became a warlock, you know the deal. I\u2019m pretty good at talking people into doing what I want, but I\u2019m nothing compared to mom. Besides, talking can only get you so far. If you lived the life you know: sometimes violence is all you have. I\u2019m good at that too, if you don\u2019t mind me saying. Seeing what I\u2019ve seen, I knew early on I\u2019d have to learn how to protect myself. I\u2019m confident in a normal fight, and adding what I picked up in the darker arts, even a few human men are not much of a threat to me. Being human, I\u2019m still near the bottom of the food chain when it comes to real strength, of course. As strong as I am, mom could kill me in a heartbeat. And mom was never all that strong.  \n\nSo yea, we\u2019re basically friends now, right?  \n\nJust kidding. I don\u2019t know you.\n\nI\u2019ve been staying in this one place for about a month when Cecile\u2019s letter came. I don\u2019t know how she found me, but with magic it\u2019s not that hard. Especially since I wasn\u2019t hiding. The letter didn\u2019t say much, but it didn\u2019t need to. I know Cecile, and I could read between the lines: it\u2019s bad. Not just mom-might-be-dead bad, but also everyone-you\u2019ve-ever-loved-might-die-soon bad. Something big was going on back home. Oh, Cecile is mom\u2019s partner, in a way. They\u2019re kind of like an old lesbian couple: they live together and share everyday life with each other, but being vampires they don\u2019t have sex at all. On second thought, they\u2019re exactly like and old lesbian couple.\n\nSpeaking of couples. I\u2019ve been staying with this older woman, early forties I\u2019d say. I could tell how lonely she was and took advantage. She fell in love with me after a day. I knew that if I\u2019d ask she\u2019d give me everything she owned and still let me go my way. So instead I sneaked away at night, stealing her car and the cash she hid under the sink.\n\nAm I a good guy or a bad guy? Having grown up with undersiders, I never felt comfortable speaking the common human moral language. If you do like talking in those terms, then I suppose you\u2019ll have to decide for yourself where I fit into that mess. If you ask me, I\u2019m just a guy. I don\u2019t feel guilty for doing what I like and for getting what I want. But I\u2019ll rarely take it too far. I enjoy the challenge that comes with violence, and I enjoy the sense of power and control that comes with it, but I don\u2019t enjoy violence without a challenge; meaning, I don\u2019t enjoy hurting the weak. You won\u2019t catch me stealing from a starving man, unless I\u2019m starving too. I\u2019d probably help a lost child find their parents. I\u2019d never kick a dog. I\u2019d definitely help a woman who\u2019s about to get raped, because that stuff\u2019s just nasty. Seriously, a guy who needs violence to get laid needs to be taken out of the gene pool. I\u2019d probably help an attack victim, male or female, if I see one person being attacked by several. I have an issue with weakness; when I see someone acts cowardly I feel like kicking them in the teeth, and asking your friends to help you beat someone up fits the bill for me. I might not sacrifice a stranger to save myself, simply because I know I\u2019ll feel like a coward later. Then again, I kind of like being alive. My bravery, as such, is probably just revulsion in the face of cowardice.  \n\nBacktracking my way home, I sold the car and picked up all the stashed goods I hid along the path. Most big cities have undersiders, and where there\u2019s undersiders there\u2019s artifacts. Most warlocks carry their tools of magic on their person (except the weirdos from Essertog who do every spell by hand), and I am no different. Though I\u2019d say I\u2019m more creative than the average warlock. My creativity is not rocket science \u2013 the average warlock is just dense.  \n\nI have a magical shield embedded in my chest, under the skin (most warlocks wear it as jewelry, which is the first thing people will try and take from you). I have several blades on me, including one in my shoe. I have a multi, which looks like one of those multi-tool army knives, only each tool is a specialized tool for magic. I have an assortment of homemade pills, and the herbs I use to make them. One special pill is always hidden in my rectum \u2013 yes, I know, It\u2019s gross and too much work to take in and out each time. But one day I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll need it. I have four rings, one earring, and one bracelet. Lastly, I have a unicorn bone in place of one tooth. You won\u2019t believe how much that cost me.\n\nRemember what I said about being near the bottom of the food chain? That would be without my gear. Wondered how humans manage to stand on equal ground with the likes of vampires and demons? Technically, it\u2019s the ability to do magic. Practically, it\u2019s magical tools and artifact. More modern weapons have their uses, but no one likes them on the underside. Magic, even through an artifact, takes a lot of skill and training to master, but anyone can press a button and blow up some TNT. And if one side starts using conventional warfare, the others will just do the same. Also, most undersiders are old, in human terms. And also, in the underside itself, beyond the human realm, guns won\u2019t do you any good.\n\nDo you see what I mean? About the letter? There was a shootout in a club owned by a minor noble vampire. Mom herself was kidnapped, from what I gather. That kind of thing just doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nI stepped into my home city of Veritom. A city can change a lot in thirteen years, but don\u2019t forget: this city is run by undersiders. And most of them aren\u2019t fans of change.\n\nI slipped quietly into familiar alleys, one of my rings acting as an amplifying for an anti-detection spell as I ran quietly past Bobby\u2019s old drug corner. I felt like I was nine again.\n\nThe old club was closed; it was already past 6 AM. Entering through the side door, I couldn\u2019t tell the place was shot. They fixed it up, all good as new.\n\nCecile was there, still awake. I could tell she didn\u2019t recognize me for a moment, because her eyes and lips expressed emotion far too human. She was a slim woman, with the darkest skin I ever saw. Her eyes were full of light for just one single moment.\n\n\u201cAdam\u201d, she said.\n\nHer face lost all emotion in an instant. I never knew if she did that because she felt comfortable to be herself around me, or because she knew she didn\u2019t have to bother pretending.  \n\n\u201cYou are well. Jane would be happy\u201d, she added in a flat tone.\n\nShe meant it. Whatever \u201chappy\u201d meant to a vampire, it was true mom wanted me to be happy on my own terms.\n\n\u201cTell me what happened\u201d, I said.  \n\nI was glad to see Cecile was ok, but said nothing becuase vampires don\u2019t need human emotional support.\n\nShe moved her lower jaw. She did that whenever she was worried. While mom always acted like a human in my presence, Cecile gave up the act once I was old enough to know it didn\u2019t mean she hated me.\n\n\u201cSeven attackers. Six days ago. 5 AM. Automatic weapons, magic, paralyzing projectiles. Unprepared. Unaware. Criers came and left. Princess came and left. Waiting.\u201d\n\nHer fingernails brushed against the fabric of her dress. She was feeling the urge to kill. An unconscious attempt to sharpen her nails, I always thought.\n\nHer eyes met mine. A rare thing for a vampire to do among their peers. Then her face filled with human fury, and I knew she wanted there to be no misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cThey will die, Adam. We will get Jane back, then we will kill them all\u201d.\n\nI felt anger growing inside me. Until that moment, I wasn\u2019t all that worried. Mom was old, and she\u2019d been through a lot. Most importantly, she always felt all-powerful to me. I suppose it never sank in that she might be in real danger. But she was. Cecile \u2018did a human act\u2019, as mom would call it. Cecile hated acting like a human. This time she did it just for me \u2013 she wanted me to understand just how bad the situation really was.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get mom back\u201d, I reassured her. \u201cYou will feed with her again\u201d.\n\nIt was reassurance. Under most circumstances, vampires only shared a meal with someone they trusted with their life, and in a place free from any danger. For mom and Cecile to feed together means they will both be in a very safe place, most likely their home, and that they\u2019ll both be comfortable and relaxed, meaning the conflict would be over. Sharing a meal (Oh, and by that I mean sucking the blood from the same human at the same time) was also one of the most intimate things two vampires did with each other. Vampires are all about blood; the don\u2019t kiss, don\u2019t fuck, don\u2019t even hold hands. They can do all those things, they just don\u2019t want to. I know I told you that already, but it felt relevant.\n\nCecile gave me a soft smile, a hint of tears in her eyes. Again, that was all an act just for me. But it was her way of telling me how she felt, so in a sense it was real.\n\nI got to work. Drew a diagram on the floor, sprinkled powder, chanted words. Both Council and the Throne already did that, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll share with me. Oh, Council represents humans, and is comprised of human warlocks. The Throne is high vampire nobility, this case mom\u2019s clan. Mom isn\u2019t very important, but she\u2019s still nobility, which is why a member of the high nobility came personally. Both groups must have began their own investigation of what happened \u2013 which is what they are supposed to do. Only, Council doesn\u2019t give a shit about vampires, and the Throne actively hates the minor nobles. Well, not \u201chate\u201d, but you get the deal. Vampires were never great at working together on a large scale. In human terms, vampires are very tribal. Then again, humans are also very tribal. Why do you think politicians can destroy countless lives without feeling any guilt, yet still care deeply for their own families? Same principle, only worse. Vampire nobles are basically the ideal to which corrupt politicians aspire.\n\nConjuring a shadow of the past, I could see the event unfold as a play made out of mist. I found mom, saw her jump on one of the men, trying to bite his throat only to be stopped by some physical protection. Mom must have seen the protection beforehand, but her instincts in sudden battle made her try to bite the throat. Though only an image in mist, she suddenly looked so old to me. An old vampire, one who never mastered magic, who never had a gift for combat, biting at an armored neck.\n\nCecile was right. We will kill them all.\n\nThe man staked mom in the heart. Strangely old school. Her body fell, and the man returned to shooting at some other target. Once it was all over, the attackers carried away their wounded, as well as three unarmored bodies.\n\n\u201cWho did they take?\u201d I asked Cecile.\n\n\u201cJane, Marcus, Miriam\u201d.\n\nMarcus was a vampire. A warlock vampire. Mom\u2019s club wasn\u2019t his usual scene. I had no idea who Miriam was.\n\n\u201cExplain\u201d, I said.\n\nCecile gave me a blank look, undoubtedly taking a moment to separates in her head what I knew from what I didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cMarcus came to talk to Jane. Cooperation. Didn\u2019t ask. Miriam is Crier meal. Joined one week before. Twenty one. Unknown relevance.\u201d\n\nSo, the men took mom, a warlock vampire who came to talk to mom about something, and a seemingly random meal-girl? Clearly there was more to this. I\u2019ll have to figure out what.\n\nOh, and \u201cCrier\u201d is what vampires call a human among themselves. Because we cry, get it? It\u2019s the human action vampires find most unsettling.\n\n\u201cSleep\u201d, I told Cecily. \u201cI will put up protections and stand guard\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d, she answered. \u201cYou sleep too. Allies come to guard us\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t ask for more details. Cecile wouldn\u2019t say that if she wasn\u2019t sure. And she was right; I had to get some sleep if I wanted to get anything done later. Most of what I had to do could only be done at night anyway.\n\n\u201cUpstairs?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cClear. Sleep\u201d.\n\nThere were rooms upstairs. Some for sex, some for discussion. If you\u2019re wondering why the sex, well, humans really like fucking vampires. The vampires don\u2019t care for it, but they do like what comes after. A vampire\u2019s bite inflicts a minor spell on the victim, preventing them from fighting and interfering with their memories the next day. Blood for sex is a common way for vampires to feed in the modern world, though most humans don\u2019t realize it; they think they have a bad hangover. No human likes getting jumped in a dark alley, and no vampire wants a war with Council. So it kind of works.\n\n\u201cAdam?\u201d a voice called once I got upstairs.\n\n\u201cLily?\u201d I called back.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t changed at all. I knew she wouldn\u2019t, but it was still surprising. I am only human. Lily was my best friend growing up. Turned when she was sixteen, mom took her in and taught her about being a vampire. I was twelve. The first year as a vampire is hard, since vampire instincts are on the predatory side, not the civilized side. One time Lily attacked me, but mom stopped her. We became close friends after that. Meaning, she used me to train her human play-acting. I let her feed on me when I was thirteen. We had sex when I was fourteen. She said she never had sex before, and was worried she couldn\u2019t act the part. Took me a couple months to realize that was a lie.\n\n\u201cAdam!\u201d she ran to me and hugged me. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too, Li\u201d.\n\nShe leaned closer, a mischievous look in her eyes, then kissed me lightly on the lips.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering how she could be so cheerful with friends having been murdered and mom taken away, let me remind you that it\u2019s all an act anyhow. Maybe you remembered on your own, but even I took time to wrap my head around it, and I grew up with these people. So it felt relevant to remind you. Also, do you sometimes think I\u2019m talking strangely? In general, I mean. If so, you\u2019re not alone. My normal way of speaking is a human-vampire hybrid speaking pattern which I developed accidentally. Wasn\u2019t able to fully get rid of it, even to this day. When vampire use words, they are often simple words used economically and efficiently. Meaning, the opposite of how humans speak. The result can often sound stilted, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed. Add to that how I never went to highschool, let alone college, and this is what you get.\n\n\u201cLets sleep together!\u201d, Lily said.\n\n\u201cOk, but actual sleep\u201d.\n\nShe froze. \u201cYou thought I meant sex?\u201d there was annoyance in her voice, and a small hint of disgust. \u201cSorry, Adam, but I don\u2019t feel that way towards you. I did, once, but it was a long time ago. I hope you can understand\u201d.\n\nI looked into her eyes, searching.\n\n\u201cFlawless act\u201d, I said. \u201cYou are amazing\u201d.\n\nShe smiled. \u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nShe led me by the hand to one of the rooms, then to the bed.\n\n\u201cWe can have sex if you want\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cThanks, Li. But I\u2019m honestly tired. And you can\u2019t feed on me. I need my strength to find mom\u201d.\n\nShe gave me a cheery smile which meant nothing.\n\n\u201cI know. Now that you\u2019re here, I know you\u2019ll get mom back. Your acting got sloppy, so I know exactly what you\u2019re thinking. And I really do love you, even though you went away for a bit\u201d.\n\nI think she meant that love part. Not \u201clove\u201d like a human love, but... you get the deal. And she probably also meant the \u201cfor a bit\u201d part. Vampires treat time differently than us humans do. Thirteen years is like taking a day off. Lily wasn\u2019t old yet, merely thirty two, but a vampire\u2019s sense of time is a part of their nature more than a result of their age. It must have rubbed off on me too, since I rarely felt my age. Growing up with vampires makes you think time will never ran out on you. Which I guess is true for them. And maybe it\u2019s why I\u2019m a twenty-eight year old man who still thinks he\u2019s sixteen.\n\nLily and I always talked like humans to each other. Her acting did get much better, but it wasn\u2019t flawless like I told her. I could still read her well enough, see the cracks behind her mask. Or were the cracks part of the acting? Was I being played for real? No way to know. Fuck.\n\n\u201cCan I give you a blowjob?\u201d she asked.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel a need for it, so she most likely didn\u2019t read that in my body. She knew I\u2019d help mom no matter what, she knew she couldn\u2019t drink my blood, and she knew I\u2019ll love her no matter what she\u2019ll do for me. There was nothing for her to gain. No angle that I could see. If anything, it would only cause me to suspect her motives \u2013 which it did. Maybe I\u2019m getting uber-played for some incomprehensible vampiric reason, but if you ask me, I think she simply loved me, in her own vampiric way, and wanted to make me feel good for that reason only.\n\n\u201cAlright\u201d, I said. \u201cI bet you\u2019ve mastered that too\u201d.\n\nShe did. It was the best blowjob of my life.", "index": "red9_s15_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red9_s15_c0_", "comment_text": "I'd love to hear your general opinion.

There was a shootout at the club, and they have taken her away. Before you ask, Mom is a vampire. She\u2019d been through worse. I suppose that raises some immediate questions. Let me start over.\n\nI never knew my real parents. I\u2019m pretty sure mom killed them both, but I never asked. If you think it\u2019s strange I never asked, that\u2019s because you don\u2019t know me very well. Mom decided to keep me. Maybe it was a trace of human emotion, or perhaps simple utility, but you know what I think? I think she was curious. She found a baby, and decided it would be interesting to raise it. Mom\u2019s hobbies were always a bit peculiar.\n\nMom is minor nobility in her clan. Owns a night club, the kind that\u2019s fancy in the front and dirty in the back. You know the deal. I grew up fast, as is usually the case when one spends their childhood among creatures of the night. Mom being nobility meant I met some fancy people, so there\u2019s that. Mom being a vampire, I came face to face with death a few times before I even turned ten. I was always a smart kid, and being smart as a kid means mastering one\u2019s home environment. I learned to talk to all kinds of people: politicians, business men, prostitutes, drug dealers, hit-men, you get the deal. Then there were the undersiders: warlocks, demons, anyone who might be friendly with a vampire.  \n\nSpeaking of vampires. You\u2019ve read the books, you\u2019ve seen the movies, you probably already feel confused about what is true and what is not. Believe me, even I got some of it confused on occasion. When you have to remember details about multiple supernatural species, all while being bombarded by stories that each tell a different tale \u2013 in short, I get it. I\u2019ll try not to make it too hard on you, tell you what you need to know and assume you already know the rest. I promise I won\u2019t make it long; I just prefer not to pause later in the middle of the good stuff just to tell you something boring. I know it\u2019s unconventional and therefore a bad choice, but that\u2019s my way of telling you I don\u2019t care all that much what you think of me.  \n\nSo, vampires. Immortal, beautiful, drink human blood. You knew all that. What you might not have known: they don\u2019t have a human psyche. So no \u201cI\u2019m a vampire but actually I\u2019m a person just like you\u201d, sorry. Vampires are considered psychopaths by many human warlocks, but that\u2019s not entirely true. Vampires have their own psychology, which happens to be different from our human one. They are built to manipulate us into entering dark alleys and getting our blood sucked. They are intelligent, which made it possible for them to coexist with human magical authorities. They won\u2019t kill their prey unless they have to; but that is only because it\u2019s part of the agreement. Still, most of them aren\u2019t interesting in killing \u2013 it\u2019s all about the blood. Blood is feeding and fucking at the same time, though no human can imagine what it feels like for them. They can have regular sex, and some claim they do enjoy it, but vampires are a bunch of liars. Truth is, sex is only a tool for them. They get nothing out of it. The easiest way to tell that they\u2019re lying is if they act human: they look sad? Lies. They look happy? Lies. They look alien and incomprehensible? Probably also lies, but there\u2019s a small chance they are showing you their real self. Vampires aren\u2019t as sociable as humans, but they do have their own societies. So naturally, they have conventions for behaving among themselves. Though they are lying to each other constantly, too. You know how when wolf cubs play-fight with each other it\u2019s actually how they train to fight and hunt? Young vampires play-lie to each other as training for manipulating humans.  \n\nMom could have manipulated me into anything she wanted, which is why it\u2019s so strange to me that she chose to tell me the truth. How do I know it\u2019s the truth, you might ask. Maybe I was manipulated after all. What can I tell you? If I am manipulated, obviously I\u2019d be blind to it. That\u2019s how it works. But manipulation tends to fail an intelligent investigation, because reality tends to not care what your parents chose to tell you. Most of what Mom told me about the underside I have verified for myself. Could she have hidden a huge lie among the truths? Definitely. But honestly, I don\u2019t care. The most important thing you need to know about me and mom is this: She raised me with all the love a boy could ask for from his mother. If there\u2019s a secret plan, I just don\u2019t care. I owe her my life, and would gladly give it away for her sake. Human mothers \u2013 healthy ones \u2013 can\u2019t help but love their children. My mother cannot feel love, and yet she acted like she did, because she knew that\u2019s what a human child needs in order to grow strong and healthy. Do you get it now?\n\nBack to vampire 101: silver can work, as it works on most undersiders, but unlikely to kill a vampire. A wooden stake through their heart will paralyze them, but only because it prevents their heart from healing. A plastic or metal stake would work just as well. Yes, they have a pulse. They aren\u2019t dead and aren\u2019t undead \u2013 they\u2019re alive. That\u2019s the part that pisses people off the most, but sorry, I\u2019m not making the rules here. They are cold to the touch, but most can learn to control their temperature. Garlic kind of works against them; it doesn\u2019t hurt them, but they really hate the stuff. Crosses will work if a warlock uses them to focus his magic, but so would any object with symbolic importance. Sunlight kills them rather quickly. It burns them \u2013 not in the burst-into-flames kind of way, more like in the pale-skinned-guy-was-left-in-the-desert-sun-for-too-long kind of way, only they die in a matter of minutes under direct exposure.\n\nMe? I\u2019m not important. I\u2019m a twenty-eight year old guy raised by a vampire. I\u2019m a regular human as far as I can tell, but you know what? Humans are the masters of adaptation, and I had to adapt to a very strange environment. I can feel anything a human can feel; but I was raised by a vampire incapable of human feelings; but she had mastered the play-act of human emotion, and raised me like a loving human mother. Are you confused yet? Imagine what I had to go through. That\u2019s what was always missing for me in stories of the supernatural \u2013 otherworldly beings were always either human beings with superpowers or killers with the psychological complexity of an alligator. Real magical creatures \u2013 a stupid name by the way, which is why I prefer \u2018undersiders\u2019 \u2013 each have their own unique psychology. They are often intelligent, complex, and yet almost alien. I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll be able to give you an accurate representation of that, as a human being cannot truly comprehend a consciousness other than his own \u2013 and I\u2019m still human. But unlike all those stories you have read, I grew up with these creatures. So I have some advantage.\n\nI left home when I was fifteen. Haven\u2019t been back since. I traveled, I worked, I slept around, got into fights, became a warlock, you know the deal. I\u2019m pretty good at talking people into doing what I want, but I\u2019m nothing compared to mom. Besides, talking can only get you so far. If you lived the life you know: sometimes violence is all you have. I\u2019m good at that too, if you don\u2019t mind me saying. Seeing what I\u2019ve seen, I knew early on I\u2019d have to learn how to protect myself. I\u2019m confident in a normal fight, and adding what I picked up in the darker arts, even a few human men are not much of a threat to me. Being human, I\u2019m still near the bottom of the food chain when it comes to real strength, of course. As strong as I am, mom could kill me in a heartbeat. And mom was never all that strong.  \n\nSo yea, we\u2019re basically friends now, right?  \n\nJust kidding. I don\u2019t know you.\n\nI\u2019ve been staying in this one place for about a month when Cecile\u2019s letter came. I don\u2019t know how she found me, but with magic it\u2019s not that hard. Especially since I wasn\u2019t hiding. The letter didn\u2019t say much, but it didn\u2019t need to. I know Cecile, and I could read between the lines: it\u2019s bad. Not just mom-might-be-dead bad, but also everyone-you\u2019ve-ever-loved-might-die-soon bad. Something big was going on back home. Oh, Cecile is mom\u2019s partner, in a way. They\u2019re kind of like an old lesbian couple: they live together and share everyday life with each other, but being vampires they don\u2019t have sex at all. On second thought, they\u2019re exactly like and old lesbian couple.\n\nSpeaking of couples. I\u2019ve been staying with this older woman, early forties I\u2019d say. I could tell how lonely she was and took advantage. She fell in love with me after a day. I knew that if I\u2019d ask she\u2019d give me everything she owned and still let me go my way. So instead I sneaked away at night, stealing her car and the cash she hid under the sink.\n\nAm I a good guy or a bad guy? Having grown up with undersiders, I never felt comfortable speaking the common human moral language. If you do like talking in those terms, then I suppose you\u2019ll have to decide for yourself where I fit into that mess. If you ask me, I\u2019m just a guy. I don\u2019t feel guilty for doing what I like and for getting what I want. But I\u2019ll rarely take it too far. I enjoy the challenge that comes with violence, and I enjoy the sense of power and control that comes with it, but I don\u2019t enjoy violence without a challenge; meaning, I don\u2019t enjoy hurting the weak. You won\u2019t catch me stealing from a starving man, unless I\u2019m starving too. I\u2019d probably help a lost child find their parents. I\u2019d never kick a dog. I\u2019d definitely help a woman who\u2019s about to get raped, because that stuff\u2019s just nasty. Seriously, a guy who needs violence to get laid needs to be taken out of the gene pool. I\u2019d probably help an attack victim, male or female, if I see one person being attacked by several. I have an issue with weakness; when I see someone acts cowardly I feel like kicking them in the teeth, and asking your friends to help you beat someone up fits the bill for me. I might not sacrifice a stranger to save myself, simply because I know I\u2019ll feel like a coward later. Then again, I kind of like being alive. My bravery, as such, is probably just revulsion in the face of cowardice.  \n\nBacktracking my way home, I sold the car and picked up all the stashed goods I hid along the path. Most big cities have undersiders, and where there\u2019s undersiders there\u2019s artifacts. Most warlocks carry their tools of magic on their person (except the weirdos from Essertog who do every spell by hand), and I am no different. Though I\u2019d say I\u2019m more creative than the average warlock. My creativity is not rocket science \u2013 the average warlock is just dense.  \n\nI have a magical shield embedded in my chest, under the skin (most warlocks wear it as jewelry, which is the first thing people will try and take from you). I have several blades on me, including one in my shoe. I have a multi, which looks like one of those multi-tool army knives, only each tool is a specialized tool for magic. I have an assortment of homemade pills, and the herbs I use to make them. One special pill is always hidden in my rectum \u2013 yes, I know, It\u2019s gross and too much work to take in and out each time. But one day I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll need it. I have four rings, one earring, and one bracelet. Lastly, I have a unicorn bone in place of one tooth. You won\u2019t believe how much that cost me.\n\nRemember what I said about being near the bottom of the food chain? That would be without my gear. Wondered how humans manage to stand on equal ground with the likes of vampires and demons? Technically, it\u2019s the ability to do magic. Practically, it\u2019s magical tools and artifact. More modern weapons have their uses, but no one likes them on the underside. Magic, even through an artifact, takes a lot of skill and training to master, but anyone can press a button and blow up some TNT. And if one side starts using conventional warfare, the others will just do the same. Also, most undersiders are old, in human terms. And also, in the underside itself, beyond the human realm, guns won\u2019t do you any good.\n\nDo you see what I mean? About the letter? There was a shootout in a club owned by a minor noble vampire. Mom herself was kidnapped, from what I gather. That kind of thing just doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nI stepped into my home city of Veritom. A city can change a lot in thirteen years, but don\u2019t forget: this city is run by undersiders. And most of them aren\u2019t fans of change.\n\nI slipped quietly into familiar alleys, one of my rings acting as an amplifying for an anti-detection spell as I ran quietly past Bobby\u2019s old drug corner. I felt like I was nine again.\n\nThe old club was closed; it was already past 6 AM. Entering through the side door, I couldn\u2019t tell the place was shot. They fixed it up, all good as new.\n\nCecile was there, still awake. I could tell she didn\u2019t recognize me for a moment, because her eyes and lips expressed emotion far too human. She was a slim woman, with the darkest skin I ever saw. Her eyes were full of light for just one single moment.\n\n\u201cAdam\u201d, she said.\n\nHer face lost all emotion in an instant. I never knew if she did that because she felt comfortable to be herself around me, or because she knew she didn\u2019t have to bother pretending.  \n\n\u201cYou are well. Jane would be happy\u201d, she added in a flat tone.\n\nShe meant it. Whatever \u201chappy\u201d meant to a vampire, it was true mom wanted me to be happy on my own terms.\n\n\u201cTell me what happened\u201d, I said.  \n\nI was glad to see Cecile was ok, but said nothing becuase vampires don\u2019t need human emotional support.\n\nShe moved her lower jaw. She did that whenever she was worried. While mom always acted like a human in my presence, Cecile gave up the act once I was old enough to know it didn\u2019t mean she hated me.\n\n\u201cSeven attackers. Six days ago. 5 AM. Automatic weapons, magic, paralyzing projectiles. Unprepared. Unaware. Criers came and left. Princess came and left. Waiting.\u201d\n\nHer fingernails brushed against the fabric of her dress. She was feeling the urge to kill. An unconscious attempt to sharpen her nails, I always thought.\n\nHer eyes met mine. A rare thing for a vampire to do among their peers. Then her face filled with human fury, and I knew she wanted there to be no misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cThey will die, Adam. We will get Jane back, then we will kill them all\u201d.\n\nI felt anger growing inside me. Until that moment, I wasn\u2019t all that worried. Mom was old, and she\u2019d been through a lot. Most importantly, she always felt all-powerful to me. I suppose it never sank in that she might be in real danger. But she was. Cecile \u2018did a human act\u2019, as mom would call it. Cecile hated acting like a human. This time she did it just for me \u2013 she wanted me to understand just how bad the situation really was.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get mom back\u201d, I reassured her. \u201cYou will feed with her again\u201d.\n\nIt was reassurance. Under most circumstances, vampires only shared a meal with someone they trusted with their life, and in a place free from any danger. For mom and Cecile to feed together means they will both be in a very safe place, most likely their home, and that they\u2019ll both be comfortable and relaxed, meaning the conflict would be over. Sharing a meal (Oh, and by that I mean sucking the blood from the same human at the same time) was also one of the most intimate things two vampires did with each other. Vampires are all about blood; the don\u2019t kiss, don\u2019t fuck, don\u2019t even hold hands. They can do all those things, they just don\u2019t want to. I know I told you that already, but it felt relevant.\n\nCecile gave me a soft smile, a hint of tears in her eyes. Again, that was all an act just for me. But it was her way of telling me how she felt, so in a sense it was real.\n\nI got to work. Drew a diagram on the floor, sprinkled powder, chanted words. Both Council and the Throne already did that, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll share with me. Oh, Council represents humans, and is comprised of human warlocks. The Throne is high vampire nobility, this case mom\u2019s clan. Mom isn\u2019t very important, but she\u2019s still nobility, which is why a member of the high nobility came personally. Both groups must have began their own investigation of what happened \u2013 which is what they are supposed to do. Only, Council doesn\u2019t give a shit about vampires, and the Throne actively hates the minor nobles. Well, not \u201chate\u201d, but you get the deal. Vampires were never great at working together on a large scale. In human terms, vampires are very tribal. Then again, humans are also very tribal. Why do you think politicians can destroy countless lives without feeling any guilt, yet still care deeply for their own families? Same principle, only worse. Vampire nobles are basically the ideal to which corrupt politicians aspire.\n\nConjuring a shadow of the past, I could see the event unfold as a play made out of mist. I found mom, saw her jump on one of the men, trying to bite his throat only to be stopped by some physical protection. Mom must have seen the protection beforehand, but her instincts in sudden battle made her try to bite the throat. Though only an image in mist, she suddenly looked so old to me. An old vampire, one who never mastered magic, who never had a gift for combat, biting at an armored neck.\n\nCecile was right. We will kill them all.\n\nThe man staked mom in the heart. Strangely old school. Her body fell, and the man returned to shooting at some other target. Once it was all over, the attackers carried away their wounded, as well as three unarmored bodies.\n\n\u201cWho did they take?\u201d I asked Cecile.\n\n\u201cJane, Marcus, Miriam\u201d.\n\nMarcus was a vampire. A warlock vampire. Mom\u2019s club wasn\u2019t his usual scene. I had no idea who Miriam was.\n\n\u201cExplain\u201d, I said.\n\nCecile gave me a blank look, undoubtedly taking a moment to separates in her head what I knew from what I didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cMarcus came to talk to Jane. Cooperation. Didn\u2019t ask. Miriam is Crier meal. Joined one week before. Twenty one. Unknown relevance.\u201d\n\nSo, the men took mom, a warlock vampire who came to talk to mom about something, and a seemingly random meal-girl? Clearly there was more to this. I\u2019ll have to figure out what.\n\nOh, and \u201cCrier\u201d is what vampires call a human among themselves. Because we cry, get it? It\u2019s the human action vampires find most unsettling.\n\n\u201cSleep\u201d, I told Cecily. \u201cI will put up protections and stand guard\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d, she answered. \u201cYou sleep too. Allies come to guard us\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t ask for more details. Cecile wouldn\u2019t say that if she wasn\u2019t sure. And she was right; I had to get some sleep if I wanted to get anything done later. Most of what I had to do could only be done at night anyway.\n\n\u201cUpstairs?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cClear. Sleep\u201d.\n\nThere were rooms upstairs. Some for sex, some for discussion. If you\u2019re wondering why the sex, well, humans really like fucking vampires. The vampires don\u2019t care for it, but they do like what comes after. A vampire\u2019s bite inflicts a minor spell on the victim, preventing them from fighting and interfering with their memories the next day. Blood for sex is a common way for vampires to feed in the modern world, though most humans don\u2019t realize it; they think they have a bad hangover. No human likes getting jumped in a dark alley, and no vampire wants a war with Council. So it kind of works.\n\n\u201cAdam?\u201d a voice called once I got upstairs.\n\n\u201cLily?\u201d I called back.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t changed at all. I knew she wouldn\u2019t, but it was still surprising. I am only human. Lily was my best friend growing up. Turned when she was sixteen, mom took her in and taught her about being a vampire. I was twelve. The first year as a vampire is hard, since vampire instincts are on the predatory side, not the civilized side. One time Lily attacked me, but mom stopped her. We became close friends after that. Meaning, she used me to train her human play-acting. I let her feed on me when I was thirteen. We had sex when I was fourteen. She said she never had sex before, and was worried she couldn\u2019t act the part. Took me a couple months to realize that was a lie.\n\n\u201cAdam!\u201d she ran to me and hugged me. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too, Li\u201d.\n\nShe leaned closer, a mischievous look in her eyes, then kissed me lightly on the lips.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering how she could be so cheerful with friends having been murdered and mom taken away, let me remind you that it\u2019s all an act anyhow. Maybe you remembered on your own, but even I took time to wrap my head around it, and I grew up with these people. So it felt relevant to remind you. Also, do you sometimes think I\u2019m talking strangely? In general, I mean. If so, you\u2019re not alone. My normal way of speaking is a human-vampire hybrid speaking pattern which I developed accidentally. Wasn\u2019t able to fully get rid of it, even to this day. When vampire use words, they are often simple words used economically and efficiently. Meaning, the opposite of how humans speak. The result can often sound stilted, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed. Add to that how I never went to highschool, let alone college, and this is what you get.\n\n\u201cLets sleep together!\u201d, Lily said.\n\n\u201cOk, but actual sleep\u201d.\n\nShe froze. \u201cYou thought I meant sex?\u201d there was annoyance in her voice, and a small hint of disgust. \u201cSorry, Adam, but I don\u2019t feel that way towards you. I did, once, but it was a long time ago. I hope you can understand\u201d.\n\nI looked into her eyes, searching.\n\n\u201cFlawless act\u201d, I said. \u201cYou are amazing\u201d.\n\nShe smiled. \u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nShe led me by the hand to one of the rooms, then to the bed.\n\n\u201cWe can have sex if you want\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cThanks, Li. But I\u2019m honestly tired. And you can\u2019t feed on me. I need my strength to find mom\u201d.\n\nShe gave me a cheery smile which meant nothing.\n\n\u201cI know. Now that you\u2019re here, I know you\u2019ll get mom back. Your acting got sloppy, so I know exactly what you\u2019re thinking. And I really do love you, even though you went away for a bit\u201d.\n\nI think she meant that love part. Not \u201clove\u201d like a human love, but... you get the deal. And she probably also meant the \u201cfor a bit\u201d part. Vampires treat time differently than us humans do. Thirteen years is like taking a day off. Lily wasn\u2019t old yet, merely thirty two, but a vampire\u2019s sense of time is a part of their nature more than a result of their age. It must have rubbed off on me too, since I rarely felt my age. Growing up with vampires makes you think time will never ran out on you. Which I guess is true for them. And maybe it\u2019s why I\u2019m a twenty-eight year old man who still thinks he\u2019s sixteen.\n\nLily and I always talked like humans to each other. Her acting did get much better, but it wasn\u2019t flawless like I told her. I could still read her well enough, see the cracks behind her mask. Or were the cracks part of the acting? Was I being played for real? No way to know. Fuck.\n\n\u201cCan I give you a blowjob?\u201d she asked.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel a need for it, so she most likely didn\u2019t read that in my body. She knew I\u2019d help mom no matter what, she knew she couldn\u2019t drink my blood, and she knew I\u2019ll love her no matter what she\u2019ll do for me. There was nothing for her to gain. No angle that I could see. If anything, it would only cause me to suspect her motives \u2013 which it did. Maybe I\u2019m getting uber-played for some incomprehensible vampiric reason, but if you ask me, I think she simply loved me, in her own vampiric way, and wanted to make me feel good for that reason only.\n\n\u201cAlright\u201d, I said. \u201cI bet you\u2019ve mastered that too\u201d.\n\nShe did. It was the best blowjob of my life.", "comment_created_utc": 1714479212.0, "reply_text": "I want to read this immediately. \n\nIt gave me Kelly Armstrong \u201cprey\u201d and Jim Butcher\u2019s \u201cHarry Dresden\u201d vibes immediately.

There was a shootout at the club, and they have taken her away. Before you ask, Mom is a vampire. She\u2019d been through worse. I suppose that raises some immediate questions. Let me start over.\n\nI never knew my real parents. I\u2019m pretty sure mom killed them both, but I never asked. If you think it\u2019s strange I never asked, that\u2019s because you don\u2019t know me very well. Mom decided to keep me. Maybe it was a trace of human emotion, or perhaps simple utility, but you know what I think? I think she was curious. She found a baby, and decided it would be interesting to raise it. Mom\u2019s hobbies were always a bit peculiar.\n\nMom is minor nobility in her clan. Owns a night club, the kind that\u2019s fancy in the front and dirty in the back. You know the deal. I grew up fast, as is usually the case when one spends their childhood among creatures of the night. Mom being nobility meant I met some fancy people, so there\u2019s that. Mom being a vampire, I came face to face with death a few times before I even turned ten. I was always a smart kid, and being smart as a kid means mastering one\u2019s home environment. I learned to talk to all kinds of people: politicians, business men, prostitutes, drug dealers, hit-men, you get the deal. Then there were the undersiders: warlocks, demons, anyone who might be friendly with a vampire.  \n\nSpeaking of vampires. You\u2019ve read the books, you\u2019ve seen the movies, you probably already feel confused about what is true and what is not. Believe me, even I got some of it confused on occasion. When you have to remember details about multiple supernatural species, all while being bombarded by stories that each tell a different tale \u2013 in short, I get it. I\u2019ll try not to make it too hard on you, tell you what you need to know and assume you already know the rest. I promise I won\u2019t make it long; I just prefer not to pause later in the middle of the good stuff just to tell you something boring. I know it\u2019s unconventional and therefore a bad choice, but that\u2019s my way of telling you I don\u2019t care all that much what you think of me.  \n\nSo, vampires. Immortal, beautiful, drink human blood. You knew all that. What you might not have known: they don\u2019t have a human psyche. So no \u201cI\u2019m a vampire but actually I\u2019m a person just like you\u201d, sorry. Vampires are considered psychopaths by many human warlocks, but that\u2019s not entirely true. Vampires have their own psychology, which happens to be different from our human one. They are built to manipulate us into entering dark alleys and getting our blood sucked. They are intelligent, which made it possible for them to coexist with human magical authorities. They won\u2019t kill their prey unless they have to; but that is only because it\u2019s part of the agreement. Still, most of them aren\u2019t interesting in killing \u2013 it\u2019s all about the blood. Blood is feeding and fucking at the same time, though no human can imagine what it feels like for them. They can have regular sex, and some claim they do enjoy it, but vampires are a bunch of liars. Truth is, sex is only a tool for them. They get nothing out of it. The easiest way to tell that they\u2019re lying is if they act human: they look sad? Lies. They look happy? Lies. They look alien and incomprehensible? Probably also lies, but there\u2019s a small chance they are showing you their real self. Vampires aren\u2019t as sociable as humans, but they do have their own societies. So naturally, they have conventions for behaving among themselves. Though they are lying to each other constantly, too. You know how when wolf cubs play-fight with each other it\u2019s actually how they train to fight and hunt? Young vampires play-lie to each other as training for manipulating humans.  \n\nMom could have manipulated me into anything she wanted, which is why it\u2019s so strange to me that she chose to tell me the truth. How do I know it\u2019s the truth, you might ask. Maybe I was manipulated after all. What can I tell you? If I am manipulated, obviously I\u2019d be blind to it. That\u2019s how it works. But manipulation tends to fail an intelligent investigation, because reality tends to not care what your parents chose to tell you. Most of what Mom told me about the underside I have verified for myself. Could she have hidden a huge lie among the truths? Definitely. But honestly, I don\u2019t care. The most important thing you need to know about me and mom is this: She raised me with all the love a boy could ask for from his mother. If there\u2019s a secret plan, I just don\u2019t care. I owe her my life, and would gladly give it away for her sake. Human mothers \u2013 healthy ones \u2013 can\u2019t help but love their children. My mother cannot feel love, and yet she acted like she did, because she knew that\u2019s what a human child needs in order to grow strong and healthy. Do you get it now?\n\nBack to vampire 101: silver can work, as it works on most undersiders, but unlikely to kill a vampire. A wooden stake through their heart will paralyze them, but only because it prevents their heart from healing. A plastic or metal stake would work just as well. Yes, they have a pulse. They aren\u2019t dead and aren\u2019t undead \u2013 they\u2019re alive. That\u2019s the part that pisses people off the most, but sorry, I\u2019m not making the rules here. They are cold to the touch, but most can learn to control their temperature. Garlic kind of works against them; it doesn\u2019t hurt them, but they really hate the stuff. Crosses will work if a warlock uses them to focus his magic, but so would any object with symbolic importance. Sunlight kills them rather quickly. It burns them \u2013 not in the burst-into-flames kind of way, more like in the pale-skinned-guy-was-left-in-the-desert-sun-for-too-long kind of way, only they die in a matter of minutes under direct exposure.\n\nMe? I\u2019m not important. I\u2019m a twenty-eight year old guy raised by a vampire. I\u2019m a regular human as far as I can tell, but you know what? Humans are the masters of adaptation, and I had to adapt to a very strange environment. I can feel anything a human can feel; but I was raised by a vampire incapable of human feelings; but she had mastered the play-act of human emotion, and raised me like a loving human mother. Are you confused yet? Imagine what I had to go through. That\u2019s what was always missing for me in stories of the supernatural \u2013 otherworldly beings were always either human beings with superpowers or killers with the psychological complexity of an alligator. Real magical creatures \u2013 a stupid name by the way, which is why I prefer \u2018undersiders\u2019 \u2013 each have their own unique psychology. They are often intelligent, complex, and yet almost alien. I can\u2019t promise I\u2019ll be able to give you an accurate representation of that, as a human being cannot truly comprehend a consciousness other than his own \u2013 and I\u2019m still human. But unlike all those stories you have read, I grew up with these creatures. So I have some advantage.\n\nI left home when I was fifteen. Haven\u2019t been back since. I traveled, I worked, I slept around, got into fights, became a warlock, you know the deal. I\u2019m pretty good at talking people into doing what I want, but I\u2019m nothing compared to mom. Besides, talking can only get you so far. If you lived the life you know: sometimes violence is all you have. I\u2019m good at that too, if you don\u2019t mind me saying. Seeing what I\u2019ve seen, I knew early on I\u2019d have to learn how to protect myself. I\u2019m confident in a normal fight, and adding what I picked up in the darker arts, even a few human men are not much of a threat to me. Being human, I\u2019m still near the bottom of the food chain when it comes to real strength, of course. As strong as I am, mom could kill me in a heartbeat. And mom was never all that strong.  \n\nSo yea, we\u2019re basically friends now, right?  \n\nJust kidding. I don\u2019t know you.\n\nI\u2019ve been staying in this one place for about a month when Cecile\u2019s letter came. I don\u2019t know how she found me, but with magic it\u2019s not that hard. Especially since I wasn\u2019t hiding. The letter didn\u2019t say much, but it didn\u2019t need to. I know Cecile, and I could read between the lines: it\u2019s bad. Not just mom-might-be-dead bad, but also everyone-you\u2019ve-ever-loved-might-die-soon bad. Something big was going on back home. Oh, Cecile is mom\u2019s partner, in a way. They\u2019re kind of like an old lesbian couple: they live together and share everyday life with each other, but being vampires they don\u2019t have sex at all. On second thought, they\u2019re exactly like and old lesbian couple.\n\nSpeaking of couples. I\u2019ve been staying with this older woman, early forties I\u2019d say. I could tell how lonely she was and took advantage. She fell in love with me after a day. I knew that if I\u2019d ask she\u2019d give me everything she owned and still let me go my way. So instead I sneaked away at night, stealing her car and the cash she hid under the sink.\n\nAm I a good guy or a bad guy? Having grown up with undersiders, I never felt comfortable speaking the common human moral language. If you do like talking in those terms, then I suppose you\u2019ll have to decide for yourself where I fit into that mess. If you ask me, I\u2019m just a guy. I don\u2019t feel guilty for doing what I like and for getting what I want. But I\u2019ll rarely take it too far. I enjoy the challenge that comes with violence, and I enjoy the sense of power and control that comes with it, but I don\u2019t enjoy violence without a challenge; meaning, I don\u2019t enjoy hurting the weak. You won\u2019t catch me stealing from a starving man, unless I\u2019m starving too. I\u2019d probably help a lost child find their parents. I\u2019d never kick a dog. I\u2019d definitely help a woman who\u2019s about to get raped, because that stuff\u2019s just nasty. Seriously, a guy who needs violence to get laid needs to be taken out of the gene pool. I\u2019d probably help an attack victim, male or female, if I see one person being attacked by several. I have an issue with weakness; when I see someone acts cowardly I feel like kicking them in the teeth, and asking your friends to help you beat someone up fits the bill for me. I might not sacrifice a stranger to save myself, simply because I know I\u2019ll feel like a coward later. Then again, I kind of like being alive. My bravery, as such, is probably just revulsion in the face of cowardice.  \n\nBacktracking my way home, I sold the car and picked up all the stashed goods I hid along the path. Most big cities have undersiders, and where there\u2019s undersiders there\u2019s artifacts. Most warlocks carry their tools of magic on their person (except the weirdos from Essertog who do every spell by hand), and I am no different. Though I\u2019d say I\u2019m more creative than the average warlock. My creativity is not rocket science \u2013 the average warlock is just dense.  \n\nI have a magical shield embedded in my chest, under the skin (most warlocks wear it as jewelry, which is the first thing people will try and take from you). I have several blades on me, including one in my shoe. I have a multi, which looks like one of those multi-tool army knives, only each tool is a specialized tool for magic. I have an assortment of homemade pills, and the herbs I use to make them. One special pill is always hidden in my rectum \u2013 yes, I know, It\u2019s gross and too much work to take in and out each time. But one day I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll need it. I have four rings, one earring, and one bracelet. Lastly, I have a unicorn bone in place of one tooth. You won\u2019t believe how much that cost me.\n\nRemember what I said about being near the bottom of the food chain? That would be without my gear. Wondered how humans manage to stand on equal ground with the likes of vampires and demons? Technically, it\u2019s the ability to do magic. Practically, it\u2019s magical tools and artifact. More modern weapons have their uses, but no one likes them on the underside. Magic, even through an artifact, takes a lot of skill and training to master, but anyone can press a button and blow up some TNT. And if one side starts using conventional warfare, the others will just do the same. Also, most undersiders are old, in human terms. And also, in the underside itself, beyond the human realm, guns won\u2019t do you any good.\n\nDo you see what I mean? About the letter? There was a shootout in a club owned by a minor noble vampire. Mom herself was kidnapped, from what I gather. That kind of thing just doesn\u2019t happen.\n\nI stepped into my home city of Veritom. A city can change a lot in thirteen years, but don\u2019t forget: this city is run by undersiders. And most of them aren\u2019t fans of change.\n\nI slipped quietly into familiar alleys, one of my rings acting as an amplifying for an anti-detection spell as I ran quietly past Bobby\u2019s old drug corner. I felt like I was nine again.\n\nThe old club was closed; it was already past 6 AM. Entering through the side door, I couldn\u2019t tell the place was shot. They fixed it up, all good as new.\n\nCecile was there, still awake. I could tell she didn\u2019t recognize me for a moment, because her eyes and lips expressed emotion far too human. She was a slim woman, with the darkest skin I ever saw. Her eyes were full of light for just one single moment.\n\n\u201cAdam\u201d, she said.\n\nHer face lost all emotion in an instant. I never knew if she did that because she felt comfortable to be herself around me, or because she knew she didn\u2019t have to bother pretending.  \n\n\u201cYou are well. Jane would be happy\u201d, she added in a flat tone.\n\nShe meant it. Whatever \u201chappy\u201d meant to a vampire, it was true mom wanted me to be happy on my own terms.\n\n\u201cTell me what happened\u201d, I said.  \n\nI was glad to see Cecile was ok, but said nothing becuase vampires don\u2019t need human emotional support.\n\nShe moved her lower jaw. She did that whenever she was worried. While mom always acted like a human in my presence, Cecile gave up the act once I was old enough to know it didn\u2019t mean she hated me.\n\n\u201cSeven attackers. Six days ago. 5 AM. Automatic weapons, magic, paralyzing projectiles. Unprepared. Unaware. Criers came and left. Princess came and left. Waiting.\u201d\n\nHer fingernails brushed against the fabric of her dress. She was feeling the urge to kill. An unconscious attempt to sharpen her nails, I always thought.\n\nHer eyes met mine. A rare thing for a vampire to do among their peers. Then her face filled with human fury, and I knew she wanted there to be no misunderstanding.\n\n\u201cThey will die, Adam. We will get Jane back, then we will kill them all\u201d.\n\nI felt anger growing inside me. Until that moment, I wasn\u2019t all that worried. Mom was old, and she\u2019d been through a lot. Most importantly, she always felt all-powerful to me. I suppose it never sank in that she might be in real danger. But she was. Cecile \u2018did a human act\u2019, as mom would call it. Cecile hated acting like a human. This time she did it just for me \u2013 she wanted me to understand just how bad the situation really was.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get mom back\u201d, I reassured her. \u201cYou will feed with her again\u201d.\n\nIt was reassurance. Under most circumstances, vampires only shared a meal with someone they trusted with their life, and in a place free from any danger. For mom and Cecile to feed together means they will both be in a very safe place, most likely their home, and that they\u2019ll both be comfortable and relaxed, meaning the conflict would be over. Sharing a meal (Oh, and by that I mean sucking the blood from the same human at the same time) was also one of the most intimate things two vampires did with each other. Vampires are all about blood; the don\u2019t kiss, don\u2019t fuck, don\u2019t even hold hands. They can do all those things, they just don\u2019t want to. I know I told you that already, but it felt relevant.\n\nCecile gave me a soft smile, a hint of tears in her eyes. Again, that was all an act just for me. But it was her way of telling me how she felt, so in a sense it was real.\n\nI got to work. Drew a diagram on the floor, sprinkled powder, chanted words. Both Council and the Throne already did that, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll share with me. Oh, Council represents humans, and is comprised of human warlocks. The Throne is high vampire nobility, this case mom\u2019s clan. Mom isn\u2019t very important, but she\u2019s still nobility, which is why a member of the high nobility came personally. Both groups must have began their own investigation of what happened \u2013 which is what they are supposed to do. Only, Council doesn\u2019t give a shit about vampires, and the Throne actively hates the minor nobles. Well, not \u201chate\u201d, but you get the deal. Vampires were never great at working together on a large scale. In human terms, vampires are very tribal. Then again, humans are also very tribal. Why do you think politicians can destroy countless lives without feeling any guilt, yet still care deeply for their own families? Same principle, only worse. Vampire nobles are basically the ideal to which corrupt politicians aspire.\n\nConjuring a shadow of the past, I could see the event unfold as a play made out of mist. I found mom, saw her jump on one of the men, trying to bite his throat only to be stopped by some physical protection. Mom must have seen the protection beforehand, but her instincts in sudden battle made her try to bite the throat. Though only an image in mist, she suddenly looked so old to me. An old vampire, one who never mastered magic, who never had a gift for combat, biting at an armored neck.\n\nCecile was right. We will kill them all.\n\nThe man staked mom in the heart. Strangely old school. Her body fell, and the man returned to shooting at some other target. Once it was all over, the attackers carried away their wounded, as well as three unarmored bodies.\n\n\u201cWho did they take?\u201d I asked Cecile.\n\n\u201cJane, Marcus, Miriam\u201d.\n\nMarcus was a vampire. A warlock vampire. Mom\u2019s club wasn\u2019t his usual scene. I had no idea who Miriam was.\n\n\u201cExplain\u201d, I said.\n\nCecile gave me a blank look, undoubtedly taking a moment to separates in her head what I knew from what I didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cMarcus came to talk to Jane. Cooperation. Didn\u2019t ask. Miriam is Crier meal. Joined one week before. Twenty one. Unknown relevance.\u201d\n\nSo, the men took mom, a warlock vampire who came to talk to mom about something, and a seemingly random meal-girl? Clearly there was more to this. I\u2019ll have to figure out what.\n\nOh, and \u201cCrier\u201d is what vampires call a human among themselves. Because we cry, get it? It\u2019s the human action vampires find most unsettling.\n\n\u201cSleep\u201d, I told Cecily. \u201cI will put up protections and stand guard\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo\u201d, she answered. \u201cYou sleep too. Allies come to guard us\u201d.\n\nI didn\u2019t ask for more details. Cecile wouldn\u2019t say that if she wasn\u2019t sure. And she was right; I had to get some sleep if I wanted to get anything done later. Most of what I had to do could only be done at night anyway.\n\n\u201cUpstairs?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cClear. Sleep\u201d.\n\nThere were rooms upstairs. Some for sex, some for discussion. If you\u2019re wondering why the sex, well, humans really like fucking vampires. The vampires don\u2019t care for it, but they do like what comes after. A vampire\u2019s bite inflicts a minor spell on the victim, preventing them from fighting and interfering with their memories the next day. Blood for sex is a common way for vampires to feed in the modern world, though most humans don\u2019t realize it; they think they have a bad hangover. No human likes getting jumped in a dark alley, and no vampire wants a war with Council. So it kind of works.\n\n\u201cAdam?\u201d a voice called once I got upstairs.\n\n\u201cLily?\u201d I called back.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t changed at all. I knew she wouldn\u2019t, but it was still surprising. I am only human. Lily was my best friend growing up. Turned when she was sixteen, mom took her in and taught her about being a vampire. I was twelve. The first year as a vampire is hard, since vampire instincts are on the predatory side, not the civilized side. One time Lily attacked me, but mom stopped her. We became close friends after that. Meaning, she used me to train her human play-acting. I let her feed on me when I was thirteen. We had sex when I was fourteen. She said she never had sex before, and was worried she couldn\u2019t act the part. Took me a couple months to realize that was a lie.\n\n\u201cAdam!\u201d she ran to me and hugged me. \u201cI\u2019ve missed you so much!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve missed you too, Li\u201d.\n\nShe leaned closer, a mischievous look in her eyes, then kissed me lightly on the lips.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering how she could be so cheerful with friends having been murdered and mom taken away, let me remind you that it\u2019s all an act anyhow. Maybe you remembered on your own, but even I took time to wrap my head around it, and I grew up with these people. So it felt relevant to remind you. Also, do you sometimes think I\u2019m talking strangely? In general, I mean. If so, you\u2019re not alone. My normal way of speaking is a human-vampire hybrid speaking pattern which I developed accidentally. Wasn\u2019t able to fully get rid of it, even to this day. When vampire use words, they are often simple words used economically and efficiently. Meaning, the opposite of how humans speak. The result can often sound stilted, as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed. Add to that how I never went to highschool, let alone college, and this is what you get.\n\n\u201cLets sleep together!\u201d, Lily said.\n\n\u201cOk, but actual sleep\u201d.\n\nShe froze. \u201cYou thought I meant sex?\u201d there was annoyance in her voice, and a small hint of disgust. \u201cSorry, Adam, but I don\u2019t feel that way towards you. I did, once, but it was a long time ago. I hope you can understand\u201d.\n\nI looked into her eyes, searching.\n\n\u201cFlawless act\u201d, I said. \u201cYou are amazing\u201d.\n\nShe smiled. \u201cThank you!\u201d\n\nShe led me by the hand to one of the rooms, then to the bed.\n\n\u201cWe can have sex if you want\u201d, she said.\n\n\u201cThanks, Li. But I\u2019m honestly tired. And you can\u2019t feed on me. I need my strength to find mom\u201d.\n\nShe gave me a cheery smile which meant nothing.\n\n\u201cI know. Now that you\u2019re here, I know you\u2019ll get mom back. Your acting got sloppy, so I know exactly what you\u2019re thinking. And I really do love you, even though you went away for a bit\u201d.\n\nI think she meant that love part. Not \u201clove\u201d like a human love, but... you get the deal. And she probably also meant the \u201cfor a bit\u201d part. Vampires treat time differently than us humans do. Thirteen years is like taking a day off. Lily wasn\u2019t old yet, merely thirty two, but a vampire\u2019s sense of time is a part of their nature more than a result of their age. It must have rubbed off on me too, since I rarely felt my age. Growing up with vampires makes you think time will never ran out on you. Which I guess is true for them. And maybe it\u2019s why I\u2019m a twenty-eight year old man who still thinks he\u2019s sixteen.\n\nLily and I always talked like humans to each other. Her acting did get much better, but it wasn\u2019t flawless like I told her. I could still read her well enough, see the cracks behind her mask. Or were the cracks part of the acting? Was I being played for real? No way to know. Fuck.\n\n\u201cCan I give you a blowjob?\u201d she asked.\n\nI didn\u2019t feel a need for it, so she most likely didn\u2019t read that in my body. She knew I\u2019d help mom no matter what, she knew she couldn\u2019t drink my blood, and she knew I\u2019ll love her no matter what she\u2019ll do for me. There was nothing for her to gain. No angle that I could see. If anything, it would only cause me to suspect her motives \u2013 which it did. Maybe I\u2019m getting uber-played for some incomprehensible vampiric reason, but if you ask me, I think she simply loved me, in her own vampiric way, and wanted to make me feel good for that reason only.\n\n\u201cAlright\u201d, I said. \u201cI bet you\u2019ve mastered that too\u201d.\n\nShe did.

Business is for logistics like tracking expenses/profits, book signing details, stuff like that. Chapters is as it sounds, it's where I write the actual novel.\n\nFor my worldbuilding, everything goes into Planning. I will sometimes further subdivide this folder, but it varies by my needs for each project. My first published novel, for instance, needed subdivisions for cultures/countries, magic/lore, and a bunch of other stuff. That world was extremely detailed and contains a wide variety of people, creatures, etc. My intent is to have two series in this world, each a trilogy, so six total books. That was why I needed so much detail. The planning that goes into this world pays off because I now have to do a whole lot less of that in future installments. \n\nBy contrast, the book I'm working on now has no subdivisions in the Planning folder. The world this story takes place in is one of eternal night and winter. More than 90% of the human population is dead, there are no populated cities and virtually no settlements, and it's also a very low magic setting. It will also be a standalone, no sequels or prequels. As a result, my needs for worldbuilding are simpler for this one. There are no governments, most cultures are dead, etc. In this folder I just have a bunch of docs for different subjects. Monsters that populate this world got a doc, the limited magic system got a doc, and I have one doc for characters - besides these there are a handful of others. \n\nI suggest you just do something intuitive to you.

And how do you think these two different approaches affect the overall feel of the story?", "comment_created_utc": 1714393324.0, "reply_text": "From my personal point of view, I figured I write better stories when I start with my characters and then continue with the worldbuilding when needed. \n\nI like to worldbuild, as any insane person out there, but my projects where I start with worldbuilding often stay at the worldbuilding stage and never progress. \n\nHowever, when I want to write a story, I often start with very little worldbuilding, and often the most generic possible, so I can focus on the early stages of drafting on the plot and the characters. Then the worldbuilding happens: either I built the world around the characters for specific needs (like fools and buffoons are not bound by rules of magic because \"rules don't apply to them\"); or I build something just for the fun of it, because it would make a fun or nice addition to the background (like a character having a coffee at the terrace of a cafe, in the shadow of the dome of the Academy of Incantations and Fine Writings, upon which gargoyles are still nesting before migrating north with summer arriving). Sometimes, I also worldbuild because I can't just take elements of our real world as if (like months; why would we have a month of January? However, a month of Demoniaire or a month of Calamit\u00f4se, based upon the naming conventions of the [French Republican Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar), is perfect). Reusing elements from your standalone worldbuilding projects is also a perfectly legitimate move!\n\nThe important thing to remember is that, if you want to write a story, the main thing is... well, the story. The story is the most important thing, followed very closely by the characters. Both are things that will make a story great and interesting to read. The rest is just fluff. Fluff is important, as it gives strength and weight to a story, but it doesn't has to distract the reader from the story. People like worldbuilding, for sure, but if we want to mainly read worldbuilding, wikis about fantasy worlds are there and it's much better. But if it distracts the reader from the story, it loses its strength as a story. \n\nOne reason A Song of Ice and Fire is very popular is not because of the worldbuilding, but because of the characters and the story. It's brillantly brought together, the story is compelling and the characters are memorable. And, while the worldbuilding is excellent, it knows to stay in its place. After all, it's quite basic (feudal empire with noble families vying for power) but nicely crafted. And I remember thinking (and hearing other people say) that some of the most boring parts of the novels were the lenghty descriptions of coats of arms, proof that while the worldbuilding is good, if the author indulges too much of himself in it, it becomes the weakest part. \n\nAnd you can look at the Master Of All, Tolkien himself. The worldbuilding work is tremendous, incredible, unspeakbale, out-of-words. And yet, when you read the novels, you see that, despite having worldbuilt (and, more precisely, invented the language) first, it's still the characters and the story that is important. Lord of the Rings is a fantastic (in both senses of the word) epic because Frodo, Sam and Gollum are excruciatingly interesting characters. On the other hand, there are lots of mysteries that stay here, about some of the more potent beings or events in the past (first to come in mind being Tom Bombadil). Tolkien wrote the Silmarillon for those interested in that, but the novel in itself is still about the characters, not the world. \n\nFinally, to look at my favourite: the strength of the Discworld series does not come from the world, and it's not a small thing to say, as the Discworldbuilding is just magnificent of stupidity and formidable of complexity. But it's encountering characters like Granny, like Vimes, like Death, like Rincewind and Twoflowers, like Susan, like Moist, like Vetinari, that make each novel a jewel to read. Heck, Discworld might be one of the most successful series of fantasy that has ever been written (Pratchett having been a best-selling author in the US; not a fantasy best-selling author, a best-selling author *period*) while its worldbuilding is nothing short of wonky. Pratchett famously refused for years to draw a map because it would constrict him where we wouldn't be to, and was forced to make one when too many readers were asking why some people made the journey between Ankh-Morpork and Lancre in one day while in some other novels it might take them a week, so he caved in. But he clearly refused to have any specificity for the rest, even using the Watsonian justification of the History Monks to justify how chronology does simply not works for some events and the lifespan of some characters. However, despite all of this, Discworld stays one of the best universe there is out there, because it's not only the world that brought so many people together, but the characters inhabiting it. \n\nSo, looking at my own experience (meager and anecdotal) and at famous, successful fantasy authors (much more relevant to our case), I'd say it's always better, when you want to write a fantasy story, to focus first on the story and the characters and finally worldbuild - and, most importantly, show the world you built only when it's legitimate; that doesn't mean when it's *necessary* for the plot or the intrigue, but when it doesn't seem just like a gratuitious history lecture from an old professor in an amphitheater at the university.", "reply_created_utc": 1714396278.0}, {"index": "red9_s17_c9_", "comment_text": "I would guess it's probably a little bit of both for most people, but I'd like to hear more.\n\nIn my story, I started out with very little world building, but a pretty fleshed out ideas for how I wanted the primary characters to be.

My world involves alien technology and super powers, so I have to develop a lot of this. I also want to explore what it would be like realistically to grow up with super powers, as well as the particular situations the children are in because of their super powers (some people want to capture them, some want to kill them, and more). So, a lot about how the characters act and think is due to their super powers and how they were raised because of them, so I ofc have to develop these first.\n\nOf course I think it's almost always a back and forth -- sometimes you've got everything sorted for one character, but then in the story you're like 'wouldn't it be cool if x worked this way instead of that, maybe I could change it/ alter the backstory of the character to make this fit' so the story (as well as characters and world-building) comes into it as well. \n\nIn my other world, I again also created characters around my world-building, however, it was less alien technology and super powers and more so a particular type of coronation ritual that I invented (particular to a specific alien species) and I thought of all the ways this coronation ritual could go right/ wrong. I feel like this way really helped me, because you basically think of every possible outcome for a system and then name the outcomes (characters) and then you have a list of characters you can draw on -- to mention in the story, to be apart of the history of your world, and for you to further add things to/ develop. \n\nFor instance, say that in order to become king, you have to be a son of a noble family AND you have to win a race. If you think about everything that could occur under this idea, good and bad, you can create different conflicts/ scenarios, and thus characters. You just ask, 'What could happen under this system?' or 'What is supposed to happen in this system, what is the ideal and did it occur?' Like:\n\n* Maybe the ideal would be that a highly respected son of a highly respected family would win the race. He would be healthy/ able-bodied, fertile, good and just, charming and amiable, and he would win the race fair and square, due to his hard work and natural skill. And, after this race, he proved to be, again, an ideal king. This person is called Bob. \n* Maybe the person who wins the race wins on accident, due to all the other people falling over/ tripping over each other/ slipping on something, and this is crazy since NO ONE thought this person would win. A lot of people don't accept them as king at first because of this fluke, but as they continue to prove themselves, they're slowly accepted and become a decent king. \n* Maybe, again, the person who wins the race wins on accident somehow, and again a lot of people don't accept them as king. However, although they try their best, this person is just not a very good king, and is lowkey despised throughout their reign, and compared to their brother, which others think should have become king, and they sink into alcoholism and are remembered as an ineffectual doormat of a king. \n* Maybe another person looks at the laws about the race, and is in fact a bastard of a noble house, but since the law says 'son of a noble family' it means that bastard sons can also enter the race as well. Perhaps they enter this race, but lose. Others think that it's preposterous that a bastard can enter, and go to change the laws surrounding this, but there is one person on the council of law-makers that is against this, saying that their state/ whatever is about equality and that they shouldn't change this law. They instead do not change the law, but say they have, and instead start propaganda against bastards entering races, so any bastard that enters a race will be laughed at, booed, etc. \n* Maybe later, say a century later, another bastard wants to enter and thinks they will do well, and again looks at/ has the knowledge about where the laws are kept and sees if it is true that bastards cannot legally enter. However, find out that the law was never changed and he can in fact enter. Despite being booed at, his family telling him he's a disgrace, and with everyone against him, he enters. And WINS! The whole nation is shocked and initially hates/ despises him. Maybe even assassination attacks occur. But this guy is smart, and prepared for this, and manages to prove himself at every turn. He goes down in history as one of the most well-known/ interesting kings. \n* Maybe another person enters the race, however, wins out of deception/ foul play. When they become king they are very sly, calculated, and cunning, yet despite these 'bad' qualities, are good king because of this, able to see past the liars and backstabbers at court. \n* Maybe another person wins the race, however, due to how they over-exerted themself in the race, gets an injured leg, and this injury never fully heals. It hurts them to walk on their bad leg and they have to walk around with crutches because of this. \n* Maybe everyone thought one person would win the race, however, they ended up falling on their face and being trampled over, and the sight of it was so funny everyone lost respect for them. This person didn't deal with this well either, and became bitter/ resentful of their one slip up in the race. Their one shot at kingship and they made a fool out of themselves. They descend into alcoholism and whoring. \n\nAnd these are just off the top of my head!

At the end of the day, it's a grizzled detective that learns to trust other people after being burnt by life, shooting some bad guys along the way. With a few tweaks, that core idea could work in other settings.

Every character has their own chapter in which they are the main lead. What you describe here is when it jumps between two or more characters in one single chapter. It's hard to pull off (if you can't do it right, it's just headhopping which can be really nauseating for the reader), and it's only nice (in my opinion) when all the characters are in one single place.

It's either this or the first option (having multiple POVs doesn't violate this since it's still the events being seen only from one character's perspective through one chapter).\n\nNow as for your question: just try both of them and see with which one you're faring better.

You can see everyone's thoughts, which means that you know who is going to get betrayed (and who is going to betray everyone) before it happens.\n\nHowever, this is largely a relic of the past.  If you look at popular fiction published in the past 30 years, over 95% of novels are written with what's called \"limited viewpoint,\" where you're only seeing the world through one character's eyes at any given moment.\n\nGeorge R.R. Martin uses limited viewpoint in *A Game of Thrones*.  Each chapter is narrated from the perspective of a single character.  When you're reading an Arya chapter, you can only see and hear the things that Arya sees and hears.  You'll get to see Arya's thoughts during her chapters.  But when you're reading a Ned chapter, you don't get to see Arya's thoughts, because Ned chapters are from Ned's POV, and Ned isn't a mind-reader; he doesn't know what his daughter is thinking.  Ned might be able to see Arya frowning, and from that he could surmise that Arya is unhappy.  But if you really want to see what's inside Arya's head, you'll have to wait for an Arya chapter.\n\nSome books have limited POV, but only have a single viewpoint character.

How his experiences and the way his ideologies change and mature throughout  his journey make him interesting and drive change in the world around him, too.

However - it is VERY utilitarian. He can pull any number of items from a pocket dimension at will. This ensures he is never unarmed, he can fire a crap-ton of arrows, and can summon in basic needs like tents, ropes, grappling hooks, and boots. So he is very versatile and everyone's favorite friend on a journey. But...similar to how you explained it - many others are powered as well, but in more traditional ways. So we have fireballs, shapeshifting, lightning and intangibility. \n\nThe MC is a but underpowered when someone is tossing boulders at him. The idea is to force him to use wit, cunning, and mundane objects to beat these insurmountable foes. It's tougher for me, as a writer, to come up with paths to victory all the time (and make them seem real and earned), but it's worth it. \n\nThis MC walks into trouble and there's never a clean sense that he will make it out unscathed or even killed.
