However, it is also sold for use as actual ink, which is somewhat outdated but still a notable market that the Portuguese government did not want to relinquish. \n\nThe Danish fishermen, and indeed the Danish government, were not in a position to control how the ink would be used once sold to the global market; it wouldn't even be practical to track how much would eventually be sold as food, and how much may eventually become non-food products. \n\nThis lead to the dispute. Denmark argued that, so long as they stated the ink should only be used as food, it was not their responsibility if buyers misused the product, and so it was theirs to sell. Portugal, however, argued that a portion of the profits should be given to Portugal or else the ink should not be sold, given it would impact a sector of the market Portugal was protecting in the original agreement. \n\nAs both countries are in the EU, neutral third party arbitration was ordered, and in somewhat of an upset Spain was given the task of deciding which side to hand the case to. \n\nDenmark was not happy with this, since Spain is both geographically and culturally closer to Portugal, and the two countries share many trade agreements. It was also felt like Spain was unlikely to set a precedent that might hurt their own squid-fishing sector. Finally, Denmark had also recently had an unrelated diplomatic dispute with Spain, which had soured relations. \n\nAll said and done, everybody expected Spain to take the position that Portugal was correct about the sale of the squid ink. However, in a total shock, at the end of the case they agreed with Denmark, taking the position squid ink is primarily a foodstuff, and gave them the right to sell the ink without making any additional payment to Portugal. \n\nWhich just goes to show, nobody expects the Spanish ink position.", "comment_created_utc": 1714505008.0, "reply_text": "ELI5 por favor, tak.", "reply_created_utc": 1714507185.0}]}, {"post_title": "Two idiots building a house", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/1cg9k18/two_idiots_building_a_house/", "created_utc": 1714422642.0, "text": "One looks over and sees the other keeps throwing nails over his shoulder. \n\nPulls a nail from his apron, nails it in.
