There is nothing else that can get you the same amount of returns as you run your business well. So growing your business should be your priority. That's a question of how to grow your business and that we can't say without more info.\n\nOf course how to actually invest the money is very straight forward. I believe in index funds:\n\n1. JEPI - ETF that uses a subset of S&P 500 and does covered calls for generating incomes. Covered calls are a safer strategy than outright buying shares. It basically gets some cash today in exchange for some of the upside potential in the future. Many people consider covered calls as a must in a portfolio. Most financial advisors won't do them.\n2. JEPQ - Same using NASDAQ.\n3. VT - Global equities. Although buying US all market or S&P 500 fund may be more tax efficient.\n4. VASGX - 80-20 global equitiers bond portfolio.

I really wanted a new gaming console, but my parents wouldn't get it for me. That's when I started looking for ways to make money on my own. I tried a bunch of different things, but I never really knew what I was doing. I just focused on making some cash, and nothing worked out.\n\nFast forward to now, I'm 18 and I'm serious about making money online or starting my own business. I don't want to be stuck in a job that my parents pressured me to study for. I'm also not looking for some quick way to get rich, I'm aware that the best way to start a business is by either learning a skill and offering your expertise or by solving a problem that exists. So I will happily put in the effort to learn and actually do something that will help other people/businesses.\n\nThere's also one more challenge \u2013 I live in India, which limits some options due to not being a native English speaker. I recently tried getting into sales as an appointment setter. I sent cold DMs to a lot of people, and 2 ended up responding, but as soon as they found out I'm from India, they weren't interested. One of them straight up said he could not trust me. Man, It felt bad but I don't blame them, we have a really bad reputation due to those scammers. I know, this doesn't mean no one would want to work with me but the replies really got me thinking on whether I should continue trying.\n\nHere are some other things I tried but didn't start due to limitations and me overthinking:\n\n1. Copywriting: No one would hire me as I'm not a native speaker.\n2. Video editing services: My 4 GB RAM PC cannot run anything but a few Chrome tabs.\n3. Web design: No money to pay for Figma.\n\nThe only skill I know is coding. I've been coding for well for 3 years and know about 2-3 languages. But I'm not sure how to monetize it. I would really appreciate some form of guidance or help to get me started.", "comment_created_utc": 1714481402.0, "reply_text": "As a leadership coach, I think I can help you out if you would be interested.Reach out to me", "reply_created_utc": 1714490167.0}]}, {"post_title": "I'm failing at business, Please help me learn about entrepreneurship: I want to be like Leila Hormozi", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1cguze2/im_failing_at_business_please_help_me_learn_about/", "created_utc": 1714489242.0, "text": "Okay.
