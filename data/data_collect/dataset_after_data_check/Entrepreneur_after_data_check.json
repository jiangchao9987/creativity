Clone an idea working in US or China and build it in your own country.\n\nIts a genius idea to make lots of money fast.\n\nThe Samwer Brothers sent several emails to eBay suggesting that the company establish an online auction platform in Germany, and that they should be hired to run it. When they didn't receive a reply, the brothers returned to Germany and, in January 1999, brought in three friends to develop their own platform, Alando.\n\nIt was a German copycat of eBay which they built it in a month. Within 100 days of going live, eBay bought them for $43 million. In 2023, eBay's revenue was $10 billion.\n\nThey cloned a lot of fastest-growing startups like:\n\n1. Zalando: Copycat version of eBay purchased by eBay for $43 million\n2. Lazada: The Amazon of Indonesia\n3. CityDeal: Groupon Clone (acquired by Groupon for $170 million only 6 months after launch)\n4. StudiVZ: Facebook Clone (sold for $100 million)\n\nThey failed a few times like with AirBnB as they couldn't compete on the community aspect but won more than enough times to make up for it.\nThe Samwer Brothers aren\u2019t the only ones who do it. Other entrepreneurs do it too. Ola in India and Didi in China comes to mind. They launched after Uber.\n\nFacebook was cloned in Russia and the founder launched VK. It is 10x bigger than Facebook in Russia.\n\nAmazon sellers clone brands that are working well. Most of the time those different competing brands are often operated by a single person sitting in China.\n\nPeleton got cloned by Echelon. Even their name is a clone.\n\nYC companies nowadays (500 startups per batch) are often clones of big startups.\nThere are clones from the YC batch too. Here's a list from few years ago:\n\n1. \u200bFancy - goPuff (raised $850m+) for the UK.\n2. \u200bMinimall - Pinduoduo for Europe\n3. \u200bSakneen - Zillow for Egypt\n4. \u200bFlat - Opendoor for Mexico\n5. \u200bDecentro - Plaid for India\n\n[Clone and Own in Latam as its targetted last by most big startups.](https://i.imgur.com/0cRZE8v.png)\n\nIn the end, you either clone consciously or subconsciously. That's How Innovation Works.\n\nWhat do you think of it? Do you hate it if someone clones your idea? Or don't mind it?\n\nPersonally think the only ones who hate it are bad marketers.\n\nPS: You can find full reverse-engineering mechanism for cloning successful startups listed on acquire.com [here.](https://startupspells.com/p/startups-making-millions)", "index": "red2_s3_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red2_s3_c0_", "comment_text": "One sure-shot way to succeed in startups is by cloning successful startups.\n\nThe idea is simple.

When you know you need to tackle something, count down from 5 (5, 4, 3, 2, 1) and **force yourself to start before you hit zero**. It sounds simple, but it disrupts that inner voice telling you to wait.\n\nHere's the twist: **this works best when you actually want to do the task.** The desire to be productive or learn something new can be a powerful motivator.\n\nThat's where the \"why\" comes in. Ask yourself \u2013 **why is this task important to me?** Maybe it's a step towards a bigger goal you're excited about, or maybe it helps you develop a skill you love. When you connect with the **intrinsic motivation**, the joy of doing something for its own sake, it feels less like a chore and more like an exciting challenge.\n\nHere's a great resource to [The 5 Second Rule by Mel Robbins](https://elidayjuma.com/must-read-books-for-2020/) that dives deeper into the 5-second rule. It might surprise you how effective it can be!\n\nRemember, the key is to **find what works for you**. Experiment with different techniques and see what ignites that internal spark to get things done.

It'll probably take more than a lifetime, but it'll leave you with an ever lasting truth about the subject.\nYou can become a rocket scientist by applying in a university, then applying in an institution for training and so on. That just speeds up the process and at the same time teaches you to depend on these bodies of education.\nIt's either black or white. Yes or No. Truth or Lies.\nTo win in a chess game, ALL your moves must be right. \nDon't depend on ANYTHING \nDon't be too materialistic \nThe more you try to control something, the more you'll end up being controlled.\nYou can do ANYTHING you think of.

An artist performs art for SOMEONE for SOMETHING, but to become the ART itself, you do it for the sake of it. \n Do it because YOU want to and not have to and also because you find that activity to last an ETERNITY.\nThis means to separate pleasures from your work. \nJust understand that you and your goal are like two magnets. Anything that comes in between gets eliminated if your pull towards it strong enough. For that pull to last forever, the source of that pull must last forever. If you do it because of someone or something, those two aspects will die out eventually which leaves you nothing to work for.\nSo all these, \"bro take a pen and a sheet of paper and write down what you must do\" is all bull shit because it's all temporary and materialistic.\nFor example, Elon Musk says the more you indulge in activities that activate your limbic system (emotions, pleasures) the lesser cortex (critical thinking) you use.  He also says that the more you get used to technology, the faster you lose yourself in that process. \nJust read the teachings of Buddha and the Bhagavad Gita.

Will make the best use of my assets, allow us to scale and get more reviews and referrals, etc. \n\nBUT I know there are expenses from adding employees that I'm not thinking of. Are there any quick shortcuts or rules? \n\nI plan on taking a week off soon to get my finances and accounting straight, but could maybe use some advice in the meantime. \n\n... tldr\n\nHonestly, I'm flying by the seat of my pants and in the middle of busy season. And haven't really had time to do a proper tax liability report, expense report, etc. But I've done almost 20k in sales in my first month and my general expenses have been about 7k. I think I need to keep grinding it out at this pace and look back later. Our busy season is short and I know I'm doing just fine. I've just never had employees. \n\nAny advice here would be great.
