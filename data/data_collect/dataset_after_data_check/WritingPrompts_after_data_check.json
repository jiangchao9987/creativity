I read a story, which had been previously read by some friends, out loud at a sci-fi convention, and even I admitted, that it needed an extra line there. My two co-panelists both said, \"yeah, it did just stop.\" (I got that criticism from one of them about another story that I was actually happy about the ending.)\n\nSecond, assuming that it ended, was it a strong ending? Could there be a better ending? Not necessarily a happier or more miserable one (although those might play into it), but couldn't it just be stronger and more satisfying. This sometimes means seeding the story (foreshadowing). Once that was as simple as having one character call the other an idiot early in the story so I could make an idiot mention at the end.  If gave the tale an extra light-heartened laughable moment.\n\nThird, and the roughest one, is it really the end of the story? There's a difference between leave them wanting more and leaving them unsatisfied, especially if it isn't a serial where they'll find out what happened next in a week or two. \n\nAn example of this last one came in my new collection of stories (based on prompts from r/xwhy). Many of the stories are open-ended as to what happens next, but a few people told me that these two or three in particular (and they seemed to zero in on the same ones) just needed more. \n\nI told someone that my \"Bringer of Doom\" story almost didn't have the final scene. And they were glad I wrote it. And they quickly reread it and told me that it would've been good but not as good without it.\n\nAgain, more stories at r/xwhy.

Before looking at the camera and smiling, as he put his hands on the desk saying \"ties are a bit much anyways, my father said that I think...\"\n\nHe smiled sheepishly, as the camera zoomed in on his face, turning what in his head was a quaint but professional smile into something uncomfortably awkward.\n\n**\\*\\*\\***\n\n*\"My name is Hades, and as you can see I am the regional manager of the underworld\".*\n\nHades stood outside the very building he worked at, which itself overlooked a barrel, seemingly inhospitable wasteland consisting of dark gray earth, storm clouds, and a river of souls at the very front of the door.

While he nodded with his lips forming a firm, blank seal.\n\nThe interior of the office was now shown, where there were lots of people working. Living corpses with bodies that still carried with them injuries they sustained when they were alive.

By way of reply, a series of rapid-fire shots slammed into the concrete at my side.\n\n*They had me pinned in hard.*\n\nAny second now I knew, that third gunman would find his angle and end me. My accomplished life of hunting the worst scum of this universe would end. In a dirty hab-block hallway. In a dirty hive-city. On some forsaken backwater world.

In a dirty hab-block, killed by three gunmen in the gloom.*\n\nI decided then and there, that if that was to be my fate, I would rather meet it head on then wait for an unseen gunman to drop me while I cowered in cover. I slammed home my last magazine into my pistol and drew my combat blade. \n\nThere was always a small delay between my shots and the return fire. Hesitation on the part of the foe. I would take that opportunity and exploit it. I drew in a deep breath and blind fired my pistol over the barrier.\n\nThen I leapt it and charged. \n\nIt must have surprised them, for when I cleared the barrier they were still bringing their rifles up and over the overturned forklift they were hiding behind. They managed to loose a few wild shots, but by the time the were firing back, I was already among them. \n\nI leapt their cover in one leap, extending my legs before me and breaking the nose of the first gunman as the soles of my boots impacted his face. The second gunman turned in a panic, and I rolled to dodge as he swung his las-rifle around, firing full-auto.\n\nThere was screaming, and the smell of burning flesh as the gunman's fire disemboweled his fellow cultist. Somehow, I managed to avoid the discharging weapon and I lashed out with a kick that swept the still-armed enemy off his feet. He slammed hard into the ground, and I leapt onto him, struggling to bring down my blade into one of his fear-widened eye-sockets.\n\nHis arm had braced against mine tightly,  as I leant all my weight against his resisting strength. The tip of the blade was a mere inch from the tip of his left eyeball. I rallied my strength, and pushed. There was a sudden pop, followed by a sucking sound. The zealot below me smiled at me, his eyes mysteriously intact. My fingers began to tingle.\n\nIn horror, I looked down to see a blade emerging, point first, from my chest. I glanced over my shoulder, and saw the third gunman, sword in hand, smiling down at me.

Some say the form it takes depends on the care it receives while still an egg. Others claim that it is based on the soul of its rider. And more believe that it is entirely random. Whatever\u00a0the\u00a0case,\u00a0this has never happened before. A dragon born smaller than a mouse. Even after a year of care, in which most dragons reach their full size and strength, my partner never exceed the size of a common rabbit. My cohort mates had repeatedly told me to try again, get another egg, and leave this one to the reservations or sell it to the circus of curiosities. The drillmaster took the opportunity to declare me unfit for service in the royal dragon legion, recommending me for menial duties until I regained my honor by breeding a worthy dragon. \n\nThen the time came for battle. The first true test of the legion. A portal to the nether realm had opened, and creatures of darkness and demons were approaching in the hundreds. We lined up in the parade grounds, not really listening to the supposedly rousing speech by the drillmaster. His dragon stood tall, her gold scales glimmering in the sunlight. The others were mounted upon their partners; Most were whispering words of encouragement, perhaps more for themselves than for their mounts. In stark contrast, Crownperch nestled in my hair, unfazed by the size difference between his peers, nor nervous at the prospect of a life and death struggle. The other riders threw glances in my direction. Some were of derision, and others of pity. It matters not. My dragon may not be as large, have as many spikes or possess an elemental breath like the others, but it was the most special of them all, for it was mine. The trumpet of battle sounds, the gates open and we rush out to meet the incoming horde.\n\n----\n\n*My dragon is the best. With a single claw he takes down demons by the dozens. He has one large scale covering his body, which is pretty good at deflecting small blows. I cast my protection spell so that magical attacks glance right off. I see the other dragons fighting furiously, going toe to toe with the lesser beasts. Mine, however, with some help from my physical and mental enchantments, bites through them like teeth through bread. He periodically checks to make sure I\u2019m safe. After all, he is my father before he is my dragon. I sit proudly atop his head, undisputably the best view of the carnage.

You felt your heart drop as you inspected the state of your dragon, a writhing mass of blood and peeling, molted, scales. \n\nThe dragon was saturated in a layer of crimson liquid, which you assumed to be blood. Its tail was a long snake-like appendage covered in teeth-marks, which continued their way up the dragons scaly body in a winding pattern.

He considered himself too old to have an apprentice, yet how could he say no to someone as enthusiastic as Frida? \u201cI\u2019m coming, settle down.\u201d He slipped his sword over his shoulder, a precaution in case the dragon didn\u2019t accept Frida as its rider.\n\n \n\nWhen he went to open the door to his cabin, Frida shoved it back into his face, smacking him right in the nose. \u201cMy snozzer.\u201d He growled, holding onto his nose as he stumbled back.\n\n \n\nFrida peeled the door open, popping her head through the gap with an apologetic frown on her face. Those bright blue eyes of hers were as wide as ever, trying to look as sorry as she could. \u201cSORRY MASTER, DON\u2019T COME OUT YET. I NEED TO GRAB SOMETHING.\u201d She rushed past, stepping on her master\u2019s foot as she went into her bedroom. Before Polak could question her, she was already heading out the door again, carrying a grey dress.\n\n \n\nPolak rolled his foot against the floorboard, working out the pain that was building on the bridge of it. \u201cWhat are you doing out there? Is the dragon alright? Don\u2019t put a dress on it.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cCome on, you need to wear something. Tuck your wings in! OW, don\u2019t bite me.\u201d Polak listened as animalistic grunts followed Frida\u2019s words before she called out again. \u201cOk, master, come out.\u201d\n\n \n\nWhen Polak opened the door, he found a perplexing sight, one he had never seen in his forty years of adventuring. Sitting on tucked clawed feet was a dragon woman, one wearing a dress that Frida had pulled over it. She had those same piercing golden eyes that most dragons had, yet she looked almost human, apart from the scaley skin and wings that were firmly tucked against her back.\n\n \n\n\u201cIs this normal?\u201d Frida asked.\n\n \n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cMaybe I can still try to ride her?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAnd how would you do that?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cPiggyback?\u201d Frida shrugged, earning a scowl from the dragon woman, who didn\u2019t appear pleased with the suggestion. The woman stood up, staring down at Frida, an action which made Polak draw his blade.\n\n \n\n\u201cFrida, back away from the creature.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! It\u2019s ok, she\u2019s friendly. I can handle her, master Polak.\u201d She positioned herself near the dragon, palm still bloody from where the dragon had nipped at her. Thankfully, it had only been a warning bite or else her hand would currently be in the pits of its stomach.\n\n \n\n\u201cI am not friendly, nor am I a creature that gives piggybacks.\u201d The dragon shoved Frida to the ground, eyes locking on Polak and his blade. \u201cPolak, that\u2019s a name I\u2019ve heard before. What happened to you? I thought you were strong.\u201d\n\n \n\nFrida had forgotten all about the pain of being tossed to the floor, in awe of the talking dragon standing before her. Not only could it talk, it also knew her master, which she assumed was a good thing. Polak, however, steadied his blade, expecting a fight.\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten old.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cSo you have. That one of your hatchlings?\u201d She pointed a clawed finger towards Frida, who grinned.\n\n \n\n\u201cNope, I teach her.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cAh, so you don\u2019t mind if I feast upon her, do you?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cTouch her and I\u2019ll pull out all your teeth.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe dragon sauntered over to Frida, peering down at her, only to stop and look over her shoulder, seeing how close Polak had gotten. The old master had already shuffled closer, moving as fast as those old legs would take him, still it wouldn\u2019t have been quick enough.\n\n \n\n\u201cDead.\u201d she said, poking a clawed nail against Frida\u2019s head. \u201cYou have gotten old. Had I intended to kill her, you would have been powerless to stop me.\u201d\n\n \n\nNow that Polak was standing behind her, she would feel his sword pressed against the scales on her back, positioned right where the middle of her spine would be. \u201cHow do you know me?\u201d He asked.\n\n \n\n\u201cDragons talk. Adventurers often come to kill our kind, so we share information. A few mentioned someone by the name of Polak. A handsome human who was strong enough to slay those of us who stepped out of line. How sad you\u2019ve gotten.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cI can still-\u201c\n\n \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything. That is already clear. How strange you of all people found my egg. Is this that fate thing you humans speak of?\u201d She turned, as dignified as ever until Frida jumped onto her back, causing her balance to wobble. It didn\u2019t take long for her to regain her balance, effortlessly carrying Frida, not letting it throw off her conversation.\n\n \nFrida peeked over the dragon\u2019s shoulder, her gaze meeting the side eye of the dragon. \u201cI picked the egg. It\u2019s a dragon rider\u2019s responsibility to choose their dragon. It\u2019s how we create a bond. I looked after you.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe dragon\u2019s wings fluttered under the dress, knocking Frida off her back. \u201cI didn\u2019t need looking after. I was perfectly safe within my egg. Consider it a mercy that I\u2019m allowing you both to live today.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWho are you? How did you end up in this form?\u201d Polak asked, watching the dragon smirk, as if she had been waiting to be asked.\n\n \n\nShe stretched out her arms, making a grandiose display. \u201cI\u2019m Everith Shadia, the ruler of the North domain. As for how I got into this form.\u201d She stiffened, not as eager to mention that part. \u201cA tactical retreat on my part.\u201d\n\n \n\nIt was Polak\u2019s turn to smirk, his sword moving back into its sheath. Dragons weren\u2019t the type of creatures to lie, which is why he felt no need to keep the weapon drawn. If she said she would allow them to live today, that was all he needed for now. \u201cA tactical retreat? Or did you get yourself killed?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cSpeak very carefully, Polak.\u201d She warned.\n\n \n\n\u201cRetreat rarely ends with you back in an egg.\u201d\n\n \n\nEverith sneered at the human, only to compose herself. \u201cNo, not usually, only in these circumstances. Had I been killed by normal circumstances, I would have remained dead. After retreating, I sought the help of a talented mage. If I had remained in my old body, my wounds would have taken too long to heal and I would have been hunted down. Instead of allowing myself to be hunted, I took a new form. The form you see before you.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re human now?\u201d Polak questioned.\n\n  \n\u201cOf course not. All upper dragons can shift into human forms. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve met dragons during your travels without even realizing it. Does the name Tabitha ring a bell?\u201d\n\n \n\nPolak glanced upwards, before tensing, getting swept up in a rush of memories. Frida scooted closer to her master, trying to read his face before bursting into laughter. \u201cMaster, don\u2019t tell me you actually met a dragon and didn\u2019t even realize it. You\u2019re meant to be a strong monster hunter, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cTabitha? The elf that runs the guild? That Tabitha? That\u2019s impossible, she looked\u2026 I would have noticed it.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cWait, you and the guild master? EW!\u201d Frida stuck her tongue out, wishing she had never heard that, only for another realization to kick in. \u201cWAIT, SHE\u2019S A DRAGON? A DRAGON LET ME CHOOSE A DRAGON? THAT\u2019S SO AMAZING.\u201d She could hardly contain her excitement, wanting to rush back to the guild as soon as she could.\n\n \n\nEverith patted him on the shoulder. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be the first not to notice. Although, she did say you got quite a good look at her, so maybe you\u2019re just not as good as the stories say. Now, this has been interesting, but I have a domain to conquer.\u201d She went to transform, letting out a loud roar, only for nothing to happen. She continued roaring for a solid three minutes before losing her breath. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\n \n\nPolak looked her over, having a theory in mind. \u201cYou probably haven\u2019t regained your strength yet. It could be months or years until you adapt to this new body. Guess you\u2019ll need to live as a human until then. There\u2019s a town a few miles away. Go find work there.\u201d\n\n \n\nFrida again wrapped her arms around the dragon, who didn\u2019t seem to mind as much on this occasion. In fact, Everith was leaning into it, giving Polak a devilish smirk as she devised a plan of her own.\n\n \n\n\u201cShe can stay with us, can\u2019t she? She\u2019s my dragon.\u201d Frida beat Everith to the punch, having the same thing in mind as the dragon. While Everith didn\u2019t like either mortal, staying with them was far more convenient than hunting for food on her own.\n\n \n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have the \u2018former\u2019 ruler of the north domain here.\u201d Polak said, the word former making Everith glare at him.\n\n \n\n\u201cPlease, it could be years until I get another egg. This is my chance to be a rider. We can work together, can\u2019t we, Everith?\u201d Frida pressed her cheek against Everith\u2019s. The dragon forcing a smile as she stared at Polak.\n\n \n\n\u201cExactly, we can work together. You wouldn\u2019t rob her of a chance to have a dragon, would you? Think about how much she would fall behind without me?\u201d Everith added until Polak relented.\n\n \n\n\u201cFine, no hurting anyone while you\u2019re here. Also, I expect you to train with Frida while you\u2019re living with us, got it?\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll be the best guest a mortal could wish for. Now, I need some sleep and food after being in that egg for so long. Bring it to my room.\u201d She casually headed into the cabin, claiming Polak\u2019s room as her own.\n\n \n\nPolak decided he would let her get away with that for today, allowing her a chance to rest before he made her contribute to their household. Frida beamed as she watched her dragon head inside, amazed by her own luck.\n\n \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I got such a powerful dragon. This is great.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cYeah, great\u2026\u201d Polak sighed.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n(If you enjoyed this feel free to check out my subreddit /r/Sadnesslaughs where I'll be posting more of my writing.)", "reply_created_utc": 1714457958.0}, {"index": "red10_s4_c8_", "comment_text": "", "comment_created_utc": 1714441325.0, "reply_text": "I first noticed something was wrong when the egg was slightly\u2026metallic. However, I knew there were different varieties, each with their own particular quirks, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. \u201cMaybe the instructors just want to give me an extra challenge. Well, I\u2019ll just show them that I can still handle it.\u201d\n\nSo I kept the egg. I kept it in the most optimal conditions I could, and after about six months (the average length of time for dragons to hatch), I brought it to the training building, where the instructors would be waiting to give prospective dragon riders practical instructions on how to handle their new dragons. As I watched, the egg resting in a nest placed on the floor, something finally began to happen.\n\nAs I watched, the egg started splitting along some unusual lines around the outside, which I\u2019d taken to be natural patterns merely for decoration on the surface. Then they started sliding down, leaving the top open. It then split vertically like a flower blooming, and the egg itself ceased its movement.\n\nInside the egg was the dragon. It had a definite metallic sheen, and whirred and clanked softly as it sat mostly still, investigating its surroundings. It stood up on its four legs (normal for some dragons) and walked towards me, its feet stomping slightly on the stone.\n\nIt looked up at me, and beeped in a way that seemed\u2026inquisitive, almost like it was trying to figure out what I was. This in itself was a bit odd, since dragons typically had an innate, but basic, knowledge and understanding of humans. The mere fact that one didn\u2019t have this knowledge was enough to concern me, and I waved a guide over.\n\n\u201cWhat seems to be the issue, young draciter?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dragon,\u201d I replied. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to recognize me as a human, as I was assured it would. It also seems, strangely enough, to be made of some sort of metal. Even its egg was metal.\u201d\n\nHe bent down over the nest, looking at the now-open egg. To our surprise, its sides rose again, then extended, resealing the egg, with virtually no trace of the seams along which it opened.\n\n\u201cNow that *is* odd, draciter. I\u2019ve been assisting young riders for decades now, after having trained my own dragon, and never have I seen one like this. This will be a new experience for all of us, as you learn about this new type of dragon. If it\u2019s alright with you, and as long as you feel that it doesn\u2019t interfere with your bonding, we would like to investigate your dragon more closely later.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it, and get back to you on that. Any advice for the moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot particularly. Keep an eye on him, and if you learn anything specific, let me know. I\u2019ll help with whatever I can. I did nearly forget; I\u2019ll need to inform the Master Draciter on this new development. If you are willing, please bring your dragon and its egg with you to our meeting.\u201d\n\nI lifted the dragon onto my shoulders, hefted the recently reclosed egg, and set off after my instructor.\n\n\n\nPart 2 will be coming later.", "reply_created_utc": 1714462260.0}, {"index": "red10_s4_c9_", "comment_text": "", "comment_created_utc": 1714441325.0, "reply_text": "Ever since I was a child I always wanted to be a Dragon Rider. They were always incredibly revered and seemingly the most powerful warriors across the kingdoms. Their neutrality became their most appreciated value and would never interfere with the politics of the world. \n\nMonsters were gaining more and more power each year. A creature that could once be accidentally killed by a mere toddler was now requiring at least a teenager to handle properly. Dragon riders were becoming more and more valuable, but less and less were coming back from their adventures. Either gone missing or found completely mangled and unrecognizable much later. \n\nResearchers discovered that there was some kind of dark magical essence being emitted from the Great Ocean. I was chosen as one of the lower tiered Dragon Riders to help investigate and fend off against the monsters around the Great Ocean. I would work closely with other experienced Dragon Riders and they would help guide me and learn the ropes.\n\nThe first year I was simply the new rookie, doing whatever the others told me to do and not get in the way. On one of the adventuring parties out towards the center of the dark magic, our boat had been ambushed by merfolk monsters. I\u2019m not sure what it was but the merfolk seemingly ignored me while their attention had been focused on the other Dragon Riders. During that encounter, I made a name for myself by stabbing the merfolk when their backs were turned and saving several of my fellow riders. They started referring to me as \u201cStealth Rider\u201d. \n\nI had left my Dragon egg down in my quarters under the deck, so I went to check on it after the battle. I\u2019m lucky that I had, as one of the merfolk that made it onto the deck had apparently snuck away to go looting. As it touched the egg, I came up from behind and just as the others, I stabbed it through the back and clean through its heart. To mine and everybody else\u2019s surprise, the once Onyx colored Egg was a Pale Yellow polka dotted Sky Blue color. Everyone I asked had never heard of a blue egg before. Everyone else\u2019s had only heard or seen red and brown eggs. I was worried that the merfolk had tainted the egg somehow or something. \n\nAfter we made it back to the guild from our excursion, I discussed with the hire ups about the situation and they were simply as stumped as I was. Nothing in their records ever talked about blue or yellow eggs. They offered to replace the egg with a new egg, assuming the egg to be unusable or tainted in some way just as I had suspected. But something in my gut told me that it was okay. I decided to keep the unique blue egg and care for it just as I have for the past year. \n\nOur trips continued back to the ocean. Every other month was another trip to safeguard researchers or transport supplies. We eventually were able to create a makeshift underwater base. 3 years of nearly continuous travel back and forth from sea to land and land to sea. The riders I had started up with now had hatched eggs and dragons to train and ride, so they weren\u2019t able to stay on the boats. \n\nI was now the veteran rider for the unhatched newbies. I became a bit of a legend to the upstarts over the years, still keeping to the name of \u201cStealth Rider\u201d and the surrounding gossip about the unique blue and yellow egg. Some of them ostracized me, others considered me a legend. It didn\u2019t bother me any.\n\nWe continued making trips to the ocean base and fending off against more merfolk and other monsters. Before I knew it, another year had passed. It was time for my dragon to finally hatch. I waited anxiously and kept my egg close.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t hatch. I waited for 2 whole weeks. Not even any movement. I considered taking up the offer to replace my egg. I waited another month, and I decided that I would go back out to the ocean again when the egg still didn\u2019t hatch. Eventually, I got so used to the duties, I ended up just sticking with what I knew best. \n\nIt almost didn\u2019t feel like I was taking care of an egg anymore. It was just a blue and yellow rock. I still cared for it more than anything, but I accepted the fact that there\u2019s a chance it may not hatch. I\u2019d happily make use of my Stealth Rider title and take out as many merfolk that I could before my time ended. Eventually, another 5 years passed and the set of once newbies came and went, replaced by even more newbies. \n\nResearch had made way to a discovery of a cavern deep underwater, completely overrun with monsters. But there wasn\u2019t a safe way to properly handle the problem at its core. So new research was invested into figuring out methods for removal or destruction or ways to get people that deep underwater. All I could do was keep making trips and protecting those that I could. \n\nD\u00e9j\u00e0 vu happened one day. Our boat was ambushed by even more merfolk than the first time. Once again, I was ignored. I saved as many as I could, but the dark magic made the merfolk stronger. A few of our fellow riders fell and while under my watch. I sank to the ground onto my knees, heartbroken that I couldn\u2019t save more. The d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu hit even harder again and my heart sank. I ran down to my quarters, and just as last time, another merfolk had their hands wrapped around my egg. I immediately screamed and charged forward, slicing my blade through the merfolk before he could even react. \n\nThe egg started glowing a bright white. I wasn\u2019t sure what to do so I brought the egg out on deck. It was burning hot. I couldn\u2019t hold onto it anymore. It fell to the ground. It glowed too bright. I shielded my eyes with my hands from the heat and the light. \n\nAnd then it suddenly dissipated. When I looked back, a fully grown blue scaled dragon head was peering over me. I was stunned with awe. Everyone just stared, unsure what to do. Eventually I realized the head extended back into the water. It was an interesting sight to say the least. \n\n\u201cProooo\u2026 teeeeect\u2026\u201d I heard a booming deep voice in my head. I could hear its thoughts. I tried thinking back to it. \n\n\u201cAre you here to protect me?\u201d I stared up at the dragon\u2019s large catfish-like whiskers. His head bent down toward me, and I instinctively understood he wanted me to ride him. I clambered up onto the immense head that was my new dragon. And as soon as I grabbed tight to one of its horns on its back, it swiftly dove into the water. I realized I was able to breathe in the water as easily as air. The water rushed past quickly, deeper and deeper into the depths. Before I knew it, I was at the entrance of the cavern that was emitting dark magic and empowering the monsters. The dragon opened his mouth and spewed out some kind of green liquid into the entrance of the cavern. And just as swiftly, we had rushed back to the boat we had come in on. He bent his head down toward the deck and I clambered off. I gave him some pats on the side of his face as best I could and we continued to the underwater base. \n\nAfter talking with some of the researchers about what happened and a little bit of pleading, I was able to explain what happened and asked if they could test the dark magic readings to see if they are still being emitted. To the researchers\u2019 surprise, the dark magic had completely disappeared.\n\nWhen I made it back to the Dragon Rider\u2019s guild, I was invited to see the king and was bestowed a large sum of money and offered a title. I could only refuse the title as a true Dragon Rider, I was only allowed to be truly neutral.", "reply_created_utc": 1714454571.0}, {"index": "red10_s4_c10_", "comment_text": "", "comment_created_utc": 1714441325.0, "reply_text": "Sixteen generations. The guild had been around longer than that, but no single family had lasted so long. They were killed in battle, or by their own mounts. Sixteen generations, and all that weight on my shoulders as I watched the egg struggling to hatch.\n\nWe weren't allowed to help them. \n\nEveryone did, of course. I could see the others, crouched right up against their eggs, peeling at the shells. One was cut for his trouble, and promptly devoured by his hatchling. It charged toward the rest of us, and I stood still, like stone. They don't see so well as babies, only see motion. A second initiate was devoured before the Guildmaster got his beast down to stop it, pinning the hatchling under one giant, clawed hand and waiting to be told what to do.\n\nMy egg had stopped moving, the cracks still tiny and centered on a single point.\n\n\"This is why,\" the Guildmaster droned, you do not help them hatch.\n\nAnother hatchling burst free, knocking over his human in an effort to get up the speed to fly. Then the rest hatched out all at once, nearly a dozen little monsters, and they set to fighting each other.\n\nNot mine. Maybe it had died. \n\nI pressed my lips together to keep from smiling. A dead dragon meant a new egg next season, a few months reprieve added to the years it would take for the beast to be big enough to carry me. No one would learn my secret fear.\n\nBut no, the egg resumed rocking, and the cracks started to widen.\n\nI slowly fed my right arm through the harness, shaking it loosely to widen it, and then gripped the traces with the left. I had practiced this, hundreds or thousands of times, on horses and cows, and pigs, and even on the carved wooden face of a dragon that decorated the bannister of the family mansion. \n\nThe egg toppled over, cracking nearly in half. The shell was broken, but the membrane inside still held it together and I watched my dragon - my dragon - use her front claws to shred it away and crawl free.\n\n\"Eyyyoh,\" I gave the traditional call, and when she swung her ugly head my way, I flapped my right hand, and she launched the way they always do.

His companion. His mighty flame breathing best friend of destruction. His\u2026 \n\nTwo brown eyes were staring at him. \u201cBleah\u201d said his dragon. Erik had known dragons all his life. But he had known no dragon that had ever said \u201cbleah\u201d before. Most dragons hissed, maybe growled, and sometimes roared. But \u201cbleah\u2019s\u201d were highly unusual in his personal experience. He looked towards his father, and from his father to his grandfather. Both met him with and as confused gaze as the one he himself held. His dragon seemed to be doing alright when it came to horns. All the good dragons had horns and so did Erik\u2019s but that was where the similarities stopped. The vertical slit eyes seemed to have been replaced by horizontal slit ones, scales were replaced by short and stout hairs, and claws were replaced by hooves. Erik stared at the baby goat in front of him. Goats didn\u2019t hatch from eggs right? Erik looked to his father again whose eye now shone with mild disappointment. Erik felt tears coming up behind his eyes. This should have been his day! The day he turned into a real man! He looked back at the freshly hatched goat hoping that it had somehow transformed into something more dragon like. The goat sneezed. Black lightning shot out its nose and exploded one of the giant stone floor tiles a few paces away. Papa Gill laugh-screamed louder than Erik had ever heard him do. Even louder than that one time when he and papa had gone riding on Feraxis together.

He had spent the better half of the last year tending to the egg entrusted into his care. \nPrior to that he had spent four years helping Sir George tend to his Dragon, Dadianus, as all squires must. Even before that his life had been consumed with instruction and practice, every aspect tailored to bring him right to this exact moment. \n\nPeering at the hairline cracks forming in the large egg sitting in the fire in front of him he couldn\u2019t help but run through all of the possibilities when his charge finally emerged. Would his dragon accept him? They usually did, the bond beginning to form months before the first signs of life were even visible in the egg - but not always; his thoughts wondered back to the events last year, when a fire wyvern emerged from its egg and set upon Shamus, it\u2019s prospective rider. The wyvern hadn\u2019t been large enough to devour the boy yet, but had attacked him nonetheless. By the time the handlers were able to separate the two it was too late, neither would survive those events; as valuable as a dragon may be, once they had turned on their rider they were deemed unfit.\n\nJohnathan pushed those errant thoughts away. While there were usually a small handful of rejections across the fief each year it was far from the norm, and even rarer did it end so poorly. The failure would still weigh heavily on the boys whose dragons deemed them unworthy, as they\u2019d find themselves ostracized by their peers with no hope of a future egg, and the path to dragonknight forever shut to them. \n\nLittle did Johnathan know just what was in store for him as he pondered all the different forms his dragon might take, let alone which element it would be attuned to. Would it be wyvern, the quickest, though also most unpredictable of the forms that could emerge, or maybe a sturdy drake, the wingless draconids that comprised the heaviest calvary divisions the kingdom boasted. Johnathan, like most boys before him hoped it was a western dragon like Sir George\u2019s charge, though they were of course the rarest form. He also silently hoped the beast that emerged wouldn\u2019t be a wyrm - the flightless and armless beasts that left their riders mostly relegated to guard duty in the most backwater and least valuable of the kingdoms provinces. \n\nA commotion on the other side of the courtyard pulled his attention away from his thoughts. Glancing over he noticed his sometimes friend and fiercest rival, Arthur\u2019s draconoid was emerging from its egg. Everyone assembled found their gaze drawn to the Emerald Western Dragon as it cast off the remnants of shell sticking to its sparkling green scales, reflecting the light like its namesake. \n\nJohnathan couldn\u2019t help but feel a pang of jealousy. Of course Arthur would find himself with one of the rarest of all dragons, and would be the first of the year for a successful hatching.\nWatching as the dragon allowed Arthur to gingerly clasp the bridle about its head he tried to force down the darker thoughts creeping up. Arthur had always had an easier time of things, and excelled at seemingly everything he put his mind to with little work - while Johnathan had to work twice as hard to compete. \n\nGlancing back at his own egg he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if the old wives tales surrounding how a dragons form was decided held any truth. While the academy maintained that the species and element were set at the time of laying, there had always been rumors that the rider, in bonding with the egg influenced the outcome. Noticing more movement in the eggs surface Johnathan knew he was moments from learning not just what would emerge, but what his very future would hold. \n\nNothing could have prepared Johnathan for what would come next. \n\nFor a moment when he first saw the wingless forearms emerge from the hole its snout had made in the shell he was elated. The forearms were unmistakably those of a western dragon, and their color had already started to attract stares - bone white hands could only mean a white dragon, rarer still than even Emerald. But elation quickly turned into confusion as the dragon came further into view. \n\nAs the young dragon fully emerged Johnathan realized something was wrong - no glittering white scales covered his dragon, neither did the taunt and stretched muscles that should be underneath. In front of him was something out of a horror story; plates of bone over bone over a skeletal frame - something he, or almost all assembled, had never seen before. What had emerged was unmistakably a dragon, but looked more undead than alive. He could feel the sense of dread and revulsion that came over the crowd, quiet whisperers of \u201cfreak\u201d and \u201cabomination.\u201d\n\n\u2026.\n\n\nOverlooking the courtyard below Grand Inquisitor Strand\u2019s gaze was locked firmly on the newest dracanoid to emerge. An abomination that\u2019s existence till now was only known to a select few. His attendee interrupted his thoughts \u201cInquisitor, what form of strange creature is that the young Johnathan boy has hatched?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing good\u201d he replied, as he thought back to the stories of the last bone dragon, its rider, and the wave of death they had released upon the land \u201cNothing good at all.\u201d", "reply_created_utc": 1714501063.0}, {"index": "red10_s4_c19_", "comment_text": "", "comment_created_utc": 1714441325.0, "reply_text": "Poshat pulled the three-foot egg into the incinerator from the wagon.

This was probably close to his 500th year in existence, but far from his first life. \n\nThe first time was painful. It was painful every time, truth be told. Dying. Starting over. It was sad each time as well. Each and every death came with a reset of sort. *More of a learning period*, he mused. \"Who was I in the beginning?\" he muttered to the empty room. \n\nHe had long since forgotten the details. Probably claimed by war or disease, as was the custom of the period. Even now, he knew he'd died in conflict the last time. He could remember the last life clearly enough. Perhaps the last three were still fresh enough to not forget. When you know you never really die, one becomes more prone to risk your life.  \n\nPiotr had long since given up on attachment because of his condition. It hurt too much to outlive everyone you loved. So, with a wicked sense of immortality and no one to love, he'd grown accustomed to risk and foolishness. There wasn't much else left. \n\nBut with time, memories fade. He realized maybe six or seven lifetimes ago that he'd forgotten how it all started.  Events and places still rang true. He could remember history. He'd lived much of it. He'd died in at least six wars that he could remember.  Places of victory and defeat: Stalingrad, Keh San, Fallujah. Those were still clear enough. Faded were some of the older battlefields of Europe and Asia, but still he knew them well enough.  Once he just took a wrong turn down the wrong alley. That was unfortunate. Less glory, just as gory. \n\n\"Does the start even matter?\" He wondered why he suddenly cared for something long forgotten, as if it held some intangible answer for a question he had stopped asking.  He may have been 500, but he didn't pass for 50 as near as he could tell, maybe a rough 30. If he aged, it was at a snail's pace. Each time he died, he would awake hours later somewhere distant, naked, and raw. \"Inconvenient as all git, that.\"\n\nStill, he found himself aching after all these years to remember how and why it all started. \"Can I go back to the beginning to make it all end?\" He stared into his laptop trying to remember exactly where he started, thinking maybe somewhere in the Urals. A place where the name no longer was. Where none of the buildings still stood. His newest passport was old and worn, if he waited a few more years, it might not pass muster. Fake credentials were getting more difficult to procure.  \"At least money isn't an issue,\" he lamented as he clicked through the booking site. \"Foolish, I may be, but only an idiot would be broke after 500 years.\" \n\nFirst class to Russia would at least make for a comfortable nap.", "reply_created_utc": 1714493950.0}, {"index": "red10_s6_c4_", "comment_text": "", "comment_created_utc": 1714473097.0, "reply_text": "\u201cNo, no, no, no!\u201d THUD.\n\nAs he opened his eyes, a bright white light blinded him.

As he looked around, he saw the source of the sound. It was a being that floated a bit over the white ground and seemed like was blending into the atmosphere around it while being physically present. It didn\u2019t have any limbs, but strangely had the control of the room. Yes, I am in a room, he thought as he propped himself up.\n\n\u201cYou know the drill, report to PARADISE\\* for your next assignment.\u201d The being summoned a screen and quickly had visions projected which showed earth.

Suddenly the building was hit by plethora of missiles, opening up the living room of an apartment. The floor gave in and the residents started plummeting to the ground.

The being was now genuinely shocked and concerned. \u201cYou do realise whatever you experience in the rotation feels real because of the physical body that you take. There is no association for you down there.\u201d the being was now moving closer. \u201cThere is something that I want to know.\u201d He said looking ANGEL dead in the eye. \u201cI need to know who I was, when this all began, I want to know what I meant to the people who were there at that time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a reason SOUL\u2019s don\u2019t do that, you should know than anyone else here\u201d ANGEL was now again back on the screen, monitoring what looked like other SOUL\u2019s, skimming through large spots of land with a seeming flick of its neck. \u201cI need to know, every time I rotate, every time I am surrounded by earth, I feel this yearning to go to the beginning, at first I thought it was just the memories from an outdated subconscious.\u201d He was looking at the screen again \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that anymore, this is a new realisation that has become part of my function and I need answers.\u201d\n\nANGEL was not listening anymore, it was fixed to the screen and skimming through different SOULS, looking at next extraction times.

Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you. I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "index": "red10_s8_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red10_s8_c0_", "comment_text": "Original prompt: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp\\_you\\_have\\_one\\_super\\_power\\_the\\_ability\\_to\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp_you_have_one_super_power_the_ability_to_know/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFiguring out your superpower is one of the most staggering moments in your life. Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you. I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer.

I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "Interesting.

Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework.

I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "I liked this story a lot.This super power is not only extremely powerful but can be used in many ways if she puts her mind to it.Not only would her Mac Guyver ability be off the charts but she could ask scientific questions and get answers to them plus get insight as to how to accomplish the questions.Like workable nuclear fusion reactor,100% efficient solar panels etc.The sky is the limit.She could also ask God questions and maybe for help?", "reply_created_utc": 1714437457.0}, {"index": "red10_s8_c3_", "comment_text": "Original prompt: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp\\_you\\_have\\_one\\_super\\_power\\_the\\_ability\\_to\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp_you_have_one_super_power_the_ability_to_know/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFiguring out your superpower is one of the most staggering moments in your life. Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you. I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read.

My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here?

Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school.

Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "Man I get why but whoever decided she was to be branded a villain needs a kick in the teeth with concrete shoes.

Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you. I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere.

This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right?

I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "so is it also questions she's asked by others, as well as questions she herself asks?

Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you. I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see.

You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "Have her ask the question: \u201chow can I most safely avoid imprisonment?\u201d I would love to see if her power advises her to break out, or if it gives her exactly the answers needed to convince the others.", "reply_created_utc": 1714443220.0}, {"index": "red10_s8_c9_", "comment_text": "Original prompt: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp\\_you\\_have\\_one\\_super\\_power\\_the\\_ability\\_to\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp_you_have_one_super_power_the_ability_to_know/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFiguring out your superpower is one of the most staggering moments in your life. Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you.

The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "I want her to ask how the universe works \nOr if Santa is real.", "reply_created_utc": 1714433803.0}, {"index": "red10_s8_c10_", "comment_text": "Original prompt: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp\\_you\\_have\\_one\\_super\\_power\\_the\\_ability\\_to\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp_you_have_one_super_power_the_ability_to_know/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFiguring out your superpower is one of the most staggering moments in your life. Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you. I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying.

He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see.

If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you. I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "Will there be more?", "reply_created_utc": 1714441640.0}, {"index": "red10_s8_c12_", "comment_text": "Original prompt: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp\\_you\\_have\\_one\\_super\\_power\\_the\\_ability\\_to\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp_you_have_one_super_power_the_ability_to_know/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFiguring out your superpower is one of the most staggering moments in your life.

I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "awesome", "reply_created_utc": 1714440534.0}, {"index": "red10_s8_c13_", "comment_text": "Original prompt: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp\\_you\\_have\\_one\\_super\\_power\\_the\\_ability\\_to\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp_you_have_one_super_power_the_ability_to_know/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFiguring out your superpower is one of the most staggering moments in your life. Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you. I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked.

And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": " well f me to the end that kinda hurts leaving her there but how do i escape this seems a good question", "reply_created_utc": 1714446119.0}, {"index": "red10_s8_c14_", "comment_text": "Original prompt: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp\\_you\\_have\\_one\\_super\\_power\\_the\\_ability\\_to\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp_you_have_one_super_power_the_ability_to_know/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFiguring out your superpower is one of the most staggering moments in your life. Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you. I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school.

They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "You gonna write more ?", "reply_created_utc": 1714452466.0}, {"index": "red10_s8_c16_", "comment_text": "Original prompt: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp\\_you\\_have\\_one\\_super\\_power\\_the\\_ability\\_to\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp_you_have_one_super_power_the_ability_to_know/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFiguring out your superpower is one of the most staggering moments in your life. Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you. I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head.

Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit.

The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "Man... Aside from being labeled a supervillain though, their logic makes sense. Without any self-defense, protag is a prime target here and the information they will be giving would cause even more danger down the line.

If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child.

What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you. I lied.*\n\nSilence descended around us and I asked, \u201cI\u2019m getting a different answer from\u2026a voice in my head.\u201d They all stared at me. \u201cIs there something weird going on here?\u201d\n\n*Yes*.\n\nI swallowed hard as my friends glanced to each other. \u201cIs my superpower that every question I ask or someone asks me gets a true answer?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* All four of them turned to me in shock, seeing my face turn mortified. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026so fucked,\u201d I stammered. Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family.

My parents. My friends.

Burying my face in my hands, I muttered, \u201cThis can\u2019t be happening, this can\u2019t be real, it\u2019s too extreme-\u201d\n\nAmanda put a hand on my shoulder, making me hunch over even more. \u201cHey, listen, you know what it is now,\u201d she said, her tone skeptical but determined. \u201cYou can control what you say, so it\u2019s not a problem. You\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\nI was surrounded by girls who\u2019d been my friends for years, so I think that\u2019s the only reason I didn\u2019t full on panic. Amanda\u2019s words were surely just instinctive; she\u2019d known me so long that she knew what I needed to hear, what kind of comfort would help. They were looking at me warily, but also with awe. And it was an incredible power, but while I\u2019d always wanted to be a hero, I wasn\u2019t sure if I wanted to be this level, and certainly not while I was still in high school.\n\n\u201cI- I\u2019m sixteen. I don\u2019t want- This is too much. It\u2019s\u2026\u201d Looking from one of my friends to the other, I slowly continued, \u201cIf my power is people answering questions then I-I don\u2019t want to ask questions. I *can\u2019t* ask questions! Imagine me in class asking something and my teacher is suddenly rambling on for ten minutes! And can you imagine the questions I might ask instinctively without thinking about the implications?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nI groaned, folding my arms, and letting my head flop onto them. \u201cThis is it. My normal life is over and my superhero life starts now. There\u2019s no one else out there who can ask questions and get the truth every time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026think about it,\u201d Danielle said thoughtfully. \u201cYou could really make a difference. You could head out right now to some police interrogation and get the truth.\u201d\n\nSighing heavily, I sat up. \u201cI think I need to know how to control it before that\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s right,\u201d Hailey cut in. \u201cYou seem to have a handle on it and it\u2019s really straightforward. And this literally means you can get any answer from, like, a terrorist. Where some bomb is. Who is on their side, if there are any moles. I\u2019ve watched enough movies to know secrets are some of the biggest obstacles when you\u2019re fighting against supervillains.\u201d\n\nI grimaced. \u201cYeah. I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t guessing,\u201d Danielle told me. \u201cHere. Ask me. Ask if you\u2019ll be able to help a lot of people with your power.\u201d\n\nWorrying at my lower lip, my voice caught in my throat for a moment. Danielle nodded at me encouragingly. It took me a moment, but I finally asked, \u201cWill I be able to help a lot of people with my power?\u201d\n\n*Yes.* When the word came out of her mouth, Danielle saw some of the tension slide out of my shoulders and grinned. \u201cThere. Exactly.\u201d\n\nGlancing to the other girls, I asked, \u201cIf someone hid a bomb, could I get them to tell me the location and how to disarm it safely?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cIf a villain has something next-level horrible planned, could I get all the details from them?\u201d\n\n*Yes.*\n\nDanielle gestured with her hands. \u201cSee? This is awesome!\u201d\n\nJust to check, I asked a question in my head, not speaking it aloud. \u201c*Is Danielle still smoking pot?*\u201d There was no response, thank goodness. I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve done if every instinctive, random question I thought of was answered truthfully.\n\nI nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d I gave them a small smile. \u201cOkay. So, I guess I need to go to the nurse. They need to call the Guild.\u201d\n\nAmanda gave my shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to take time to recalibrate your brain so that you always speak statements, so you don\u2019t get information you don\u2019t want,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIt could be mind reading you had no control over, right? Could be worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight.\u201d Sighing heavily, I got up and left with my backpack, dumped the remnants of my lunch, and then headed off.\n\nMy nurse needed some convincing, but I started with something easy. \u201cAsk me something I couldn\u2019t know the answer to.\u201d\n\nShe blinked in surprise. \u201cAh\u2026what\u2019s my cat\u2019s name?\u201d\n\nI smiled. \u201cFelix.\u201d\n\nHer eyebrows shot up. \u201cOh boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, you can say that again,\u201d I chuckled.\n\nLooking dazed, she dialed the number on her phone, making the call that would irrevocably change my life.\n\nThere were two guild members that came to fetch me, Fusion and Trailblazer. \u201cYou\u2019re Joan Grandison?\u201d Fusion asked.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d I said with a nervous smile as the word *yes* sounded through my head. Grimacing, I realized that that was indeed going to get annoying after all.\n\n\u201cOkay then. Right this way.\u201d\n\nI was driven to Guild headquarters, which was a giant, beautiful building I\u2019d only ever seen on television. They sat me in a chair in a small office, something that looked like an IKEA-built office from the 70\u2019s. Eventually I got bored and took out my phone to play Words With Friends, but there was no reception and all the wi-fi spots were locked. I sighed, slumping in my chair, looking around the room.\n\nThere were some accolades on the wall to my right and a large bookshelf stuffed with books to my left. I wanted something to read. However, from the spines, the books looked like they were all heavy types, thick with jargon and technical information about the superhero and supervillain world, so they weren\u2019t that appealing.\n\n\u201cHm. Which of these books would I enjoy reading?\u201d\n\n*The Great and the Weary by Margaret Bryant.*\n\nStanding up, I went over and looked over the expanse of books. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d\n\n*Second shelf up, twenty-four books from the left.*\n\nFollowing the directions, I picked out the book and read the blurb on the back. \u201cOh this sounds funny.\u201d Taking a seat, I leaned back and started to read. Ten minutes in, I realized my ability hadn\u2019t steered me wrong, and I smiled.\n\nIt took over an hour for them to come back. \u201cHey,\u201d I said as the woman walked in. \u201cYou guys forget about me?\u201d\n\n*No.*\n\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said with a tight smile. I noticed Trailblazer stood in the corner, out of the way, as the woman held out a hand. \u201cI\u2019m Valerie Hayek, and I\u2019m in charge of\u2026logistics.\u201d\n\nI shook her hand and put the book down on her desk. \u201cOkay.\u201d I was careful not to ask any more questions. I didn\u2019t want to know some top secret information by accident, that\u2019s for sure. Just letting her explain things would be for the best.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion; that\u2019s what kept you waiting. The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "this is so AWESOME had a great time reading", "reply_created_utc": 1714479353.0}, {"index": "red10_s8_c19_", "comment_text": "Original prompt: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp\\_you\\_have\\_one\\_super\\_power\\_the\\_ability\\_to\\_know/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/k42lei/wp_you_have_one_super_power_the_ability_to_know/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nFiguring out your superpower is one of the most staggering moments in your life. Even more so for me, but everyone who makes the discovery of super strength or flight or laser eyes has their world rocked. The power opens doors, if they\u2019re high level. If they\u2019re worth enough. I had dreamt of being a hero, sometimes literally, since I was a child. That wasn\u2019t surprising, since my uncle\u2019s life was dramatically saved by one and he was quite the storyteller.\n\nThen it all went wrong.\n\nFor me, the discovery occurred when I was sixteen, a little late to find out what your power is, but not too unheard of. At lunch with friends that Friday, I\u2019d asked, \u201cSo, what\u2019re you doing this weekend?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame old, same old,\u201d Hailey said. \u201cCatch up on sleep. Homework. I really want to spend some time cutting some zombie heads off too.\u201d But over her voice in my head echoed truths.\n\n*Putting a ton of effort into my science project.*\n\n*Being miserable and doing homework so I don\u2019t fail math again.*\n\n*Screwing my boyfriend\u2019s brains out.*\n\n*Smoking too much pot.*\n\nI stared at Danielle in shock. \u201cWhat the fuck was that?\u201d I asked.\n\nThey all looked at me, surprised and confused.\n\n\u201cI thought you quit smoking?\u201d I asked Danielle.\n\nHer eyes narrowed. \u201cI did. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s what I told you.

The Guild is going to have an emergency meeting to discuss your abilities and their implications.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh\u2026wow,\u201d I managed. \u201cOkay, so\u2026what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you be okay waiting here?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long wait, but I see you already found a book you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, my power helped me out,\u201d I said with a grin.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, her voice tense. My grin faded. \u201cThis is a severe superpower, so we\u2019re going to need some time to discuss\u2026everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said. I wrung my hands. \u201cDo my parents know I\u2019m here? That I\u2019m okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we called them,\u201d Valerie said with a nod.\n\n*Yes they know you\u2019re here and okay.*\n\nShe stiffened and I realized my mistake. \u201cSorry,\u201d I winced. \u201cI\u2019m still- I need to get used to it. I didn\u2019t mean to-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she assured me. \u201cIf you need anything, Trailblazer will be right outside. He can get you an early dinner if this meeting lasts that long. And they can go quite long.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Okay.\u201d That seemed mildly terrifying. The Guild\u2019s top brass were having a meeting about me that was going to go on for ages? \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2026wait here, then.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded again, forcing a smile, before leaving with Trailblazer. I realized the implications of that also, the fact that a high-ranking superhero was there to look after me. Was he there to keep me safe or keep me from leaving?\n\nI didn\u2019t ask the question aloud.\n\nIt took ages for them to finish, and at about 4:30 I did indeed open the door and let Trailblazer know I was hungry and wanted to order a pizza. He said got me a pepperoni delivered from Dominos with a bottle of Coke, and I ate it by myself, in that little room, left to ruminate in my thoughts. If I hadn\u2019t had books to occupy my mind, I would\u2019ve probably lost it out of paranoia.\n\nFinally, Valerie returned. \u201cAll right. I apologize for the long wait,\u201d she told me, taking a seat behind her desk.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight, right\u2026\u201d She took a breath. \u201cMiss Grandison\u2026I\u2019m afraid the Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain.\u201d\n\nA silence, thick like cotton, settled over us, heavy and suffocating. \u201cThey\u2026what?\u201d I whispered in astonishment.\n\n*The Guild has concluded that you\u2019re a tier five supervillain*, the voice in my head repeated unhelpfully.\n\n\u201cI know this is a shock,\u201d Valerie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of national security, you see. Ask any question, get the truth? It\u2019s impossible to label you a superhero.\u201d\n\nI glared at her. \u201cLabel? I\u2019m not being labeled. I\u2019m being\u2026branded,\u201d I said quietly. \u201cAny of the other heroes could use their powers for evil. I\u2019m not a supervillain. I\u2019m a girl who\u2019s still in high school. What about- I can ask villains questions! If there\u2019s some emergency and you need the truth-\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how this works,\u201d she said, looking sympathetic. \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry. *But* the fact that you can only learn things you speak *aloud* is incredibly valuable here. It gives us some wiggle room in terms of managing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cManaging it,\u201d I echoed. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means figuring out a training regimen and deciding how to best protect you from those who would want to use your abilities.\u201d\n\n*It means deciding what kind of lockdown you\u2019ll be put under, whether it\u2019s an ankle bracelet or a supermax prison.*\n\nMy face went slack and my breath caught in my throat. Valerie noticed my change in demeanor and comprehension bloomed on her face. \u201cAll right. You clearly got another answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to put me in prison,\u201d I whispered. Tears came to my eyes, unbidden and annoying. I blinked them back quickly. \u201cYou can\u2019t just do that. I\u2019m a person. Whatever you\u2019re doing to make sure I don\u2019t turn into a supervillain, you can\u2019t just shove me in the deepest hole you can find.\u201d\n\n\u201cShoving you in a hole is not what this is,\u201d she assured me. \u201cBut I want you to think about how dangerous this would be to your friends and family. You can\u2019t defend yourself. If a supervillain kidnaps you and a loved one of yours, threatens them, they could get answers to questions that would make them capable of nearly *anything*. The sky\u2019s the limit. Essentially, the Guild has declared you the most dangerous supervillain in existence.\u201d\n\nI flinched and, folding my arms and leaning back in my chair, I grasped my elbows tightly. The image of my two little brothers being bound and gagged, threatened by a notorious supervillain I\u2019d seen rampaging on TV at one point or another, sent a shiver down my spine. Not just them. My parents. My friends. Would I ever see them again?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll live here, in a guest suite,\u201d she told me. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll be given an ankle monitor so-\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to my parents,\u201d I whimpered.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re on their way,\u201d Valerie said with a nod of her head. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of determining what\u2019s safest for them. It may be that they\u2019ll vie for tracking devices in case of a kidnapping, or they might move into Guild headquarters with you.\u201d\n\nBlinking back more tears, I quietly spoke, \u201cBut-But I have school. And my bedroom, all my stuff-\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will all be packed and brought here,\u201d she told me reassuringly. \u201cAnd you can still text your friends from your old school and talk to them, though you might want to reassess whether staying close with them is something you want to do.\u201d\n\nShe was already calling it my old school. I\u2019d just left it six hours ago.\n\nThe tears were finally telling me in no uncertain terms that they were coming. \u201cCan I please have a moment alone?\u201d I choked out.\n\n*Yes.*\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Valerie said softly, pushing herself to her feet. She glanced at Trailblazer and motioned outside, and the two of them left.\n\nI didn\u2019t so much burst into tears as I melted into a puddle of them.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "comment_created_utc": 1714427177.0, "reply_text": "Good work.

Even the horses are cold, breath crystalizing on the tiny hairs that ring their nostrils. They are of local provenance, with no ears to speak of, and thick, wooly coats like sheep. Their hooves are larger by half than the great draught beasts we used back home for ploughing fields, and their short tails are only long enough to protect their nethers from the ice. Long, ice-crusted lashes hide their eyes, but they do not need to see to find their way.\n\nThe path is worn deep. On either side, snow walls rise too high to see past. In the midst of all this, the world's most precious resource is kept safe, hidden in a stone temple that is itself hidden in snow. There are fewer than a hundred specimens here in this temple, and yet, it holds more than the entire rest of the world combined. Antarctic Gold, some call it.\n\nWe leave the horses in the temple courtyard, and continue on foot, removing layers as we go. Fur coats off, we shake them and hang them on the waiting pegs. Then the first layers of wool, and so on, each shaken and hung up before we walk to the next hook.\n\nBy the time we reach the inner sanctum, we are nearly naked, wearing only underclothes. Here, the floor is hot underfoot, almost painfully, from the volcanic springs below. The air is steamy from it all. It hurts in our lungs after so much cold, and worse, we know we must go back into that cold soon, and feel the pain of our bones turning to ice all over again.\n\nEDIT\n\nPaetr steps into the innermost chamber, where the Rapunzeliiae Floureum grow. \"Mother of Kirish!\" he swears, and stomps back out, \"Still not ready!\"\n\nI trust him, but check with my own eyes. The plants are healthy, with their leaves thick and dark, but there are no flowers. A few, far too few, have buds starting, but they should have bloomed already weeks ago.\n\nA single petal can be dried and ground into enough Rapun powder for ten doses, enough to save ten people from certain death. Six petals form on every flower, and usually there are a dozen flowers or more on each of these near-hundred plants. Thousands of doses. Thousands of lives.\n\n\"Come,\" I say, \"if we linger the horses will leave us behind.\"\n\nIt is a common saying here. We walk back out, drying the sweat from our bodies with thick, rough-woven towels before putting on layer after layer as we retreat into the deathly cold. With our fur hoods up, we step outside to find our horses patiently waiting for us. We mount up, feeling the fresh frost layer that has formed over the saddles in our absence. \n\nThe hot springs that vent here do more than the keep the flower alive, they fuel the endless snow.\n\nWe ride out, defeated.

The polished chrome walls and floor reflected light easily and the occasional lights in the ceiling every few meters was enough to illuminate the extended passage. \"You were so helpful last time, I hoped you wouldn't mind.\"\r  \n\r  \n\"Not at all!\" Eury was glad to help out Chroma Corp. again. She saw it as another opportunity to further her relationship with the company. Most of her classmates who were interested in business favored joining Sharp Development for their future; but, she wanted something different. And, she wasn't just helping Chroma Corp., she was assisting Meredith; El Mundo from the Chrome Court. She was ecstatic to be asked to help again, though she tried to play it cool. \"Thanks for thinking of me again!\"\r  \n\r  \n\"This is too trivial to get Tim to do it; but, important enough that I need someone I trust.\" Eury felt appreciated and couldn't stop grinning. \r  \n\r  \n\"How can I help?\" Eury asked. She could see the exit at the end of the hall and assumed whatever she was there for would be outside. \r  \n\r  \n\"Have you heard of Phoenix Magnolias?\" \r  \n\r  \n\"No,\" Eury shook her head.\r  \n\r  \n\"It's a magical flower known to completely heal people when eaten,\" Meredith explained. \r  \n\r  \n\"Oh? That sounds handy...,\" Eury said. It was a slightly disappointing answer. Both Sharp Development and Chroma Corp. had access to advanced nanotechnology, and magic, that could heal almost anyone of anything. Each corporation had robust medical divisions spread out across countless Earths. A healing flower seemed novel, but not important in any way that she could see. \r  \n\r  \n\"It's generally more trouble than it's worth,\" Meredith shrugged. \"It's a temperamental flower that only blooms once a year. And, it's delicate enough that if I try to force it, the flowers come out misshapen. The only way to get them to bloom consistently in bulk is time,\" Meredith smiled down at Eury. \r  \n\r  \n\"Oh, okay..,\" Eury nodded. She pieced together an idea of why she was there now. \"But.. what are you going to use them for?\"\r  \n\r  \n\"The Phoenix Magnolia also happens to be a gorgeous flower,\" she answered. \"I could force them to grow if we only needed the medicinal effects. Ugly petals wouldn't be a problem if they're to be eaten, or used as ingredients. But, Chroma decided on the centerpieces for Minerva's wedding...,\" she said. \r  \n\r  \n\"Ohhh,\" Eury understood. They reached the exit and pushed through the double doors out into a vast plain with several greenhouses. \r  \n\r  \n\"So, here's what I need from you...,\" Meredith guided Eury to the closest greenhouse. It was almost as large as a football field with perfectly transparent glass. If not for the frame holding everything together, the walls might have been invisible. \"...I want you to speed up time until the Phoenix Magnolias bloom, then lock them down. But, you can't go too fast because you'll either miss the timing or make them ugly. You can speed through most of the year; but, slow down a month before they're due to bloom. Tim did some minor experimentation for me and he recommends 4x speed at most. And, rewinding time ruins them too.\" \r  \n\r  \n\"Is it safe to do the whole greenhouse at once?\" Eury asked. Meredith nodded.\r  \n\r  \n\"We organized them that way intentionally. But, only one greenhouse at a time. Whenever you've reached your limit, report it to Ruby and she'll arrange the pickup. Don't time-lock more greenhouses than you can handle,\" she advised. \"I can't stress enough how sensitive they are.\" \r  \n\r  \n\"I get to report to Ruby!?\" Eury giggled with the question. It was almost overwhelming that she'd get to report to the CEO of Chroma Corp. \r  \n\r  \n\"She insisted,\" Meredith smiled. \"You'll be a big help in making Minerva's wedding beautiful, we're all really glad we can rely on you like this.\" \r  \n\r  \n\"Thank you!\" Eury beamed. \r  \n\r  \n\"And... one more thing...,\" Meredith said. Her voice took on a more apologetic tone as she reached up and tapped her temple by her eye. Despite the friendliness of the last few minutes, Eury felt instantly self-conscious again. She wore a translucent purple visor over her eyes and she knew exactly what Meredith was going to say. \"I hate bringing it up; but, it's another thing Ruby insisted on. I know it's not a risk; but, she asked me to remind you, so I have to. Please don't take off your visor.\" \r  \n\r  \n\"I won't,\" Eury nodded. She tried to sound confident and nonchalant with the terse answer. \r  \n\r  \n\"I know...,\" Meredith gave Eury a friendly pat on the shoulder. \"Ruby's kind of a stickler for communication. Don't hold it against us,\" she added. \"If we really thought it was a risk, we wouldn't have asked you to do this. The trust is there; but, habits are habits,\" she shrugged. \r  \n\r  \n\"I understand, thank you,\" Eury did feel somewhat better after that explanation. Without the visor, she would kill anything she looked at. She was aware of that more than anyone, and it was insulting that the warning was given at all. But, Meredith made a great point. The fact was this time Meredith asked her for help specifically. The last time Eury was asked to help it was mostly chance. There were plenty of others that could control time like her; but, she was the one they came to. Death gaze and all. \r  \n\r  \n\"Well, I'll leave you to it,\" Meredith gave Eury one final pat on the shoulder and started walking. \"That'll be two favors I owe you,\" she added with a final wave. \r  \n\n\n\\*\\*\\* Thank you for reading!

But just some sun and water and you could have a garden of them.\"\n\n\"Why... that's wonderful!\" Sam said.

Good for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cA god?! So I can just snap my fingers and make a guy?\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head, looking a bit sheepish. \u201cNo, those are the divine ones. You\u2019re an eldritch. Specifically, an atemporal one.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that means\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know world-lines?\u201d\n\nI stare at him.\n\n\u201cOk, your world has this thing called physics, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to go that basic. I know the whole e=mc^2 thing and the difference between now and then. What\u2019s a world-line?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, your worlds physicists could explain it better than I could, but it\u2019s essentially a trail you leave in the past and future. Like a big worm, each infinitesimal slice representing a different moment of your life. With me so far?\u201d\n\nI nod. Not really, but at least he\u2019s talking.\n\n\u201cThese, in your world, are 4D objects. Time objects if you will. And your world is 3D, with width, length and height. This is a world with only length and height.\u201d\n\nIt suddenly clicks.\n\n\u201cSo time for them is width for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBingo!

The temporal shocks did. Since we are \u2018width\u2019 without a proper past and future to them, our voices and presence almost constantly resonate through time. Think stepping on a million butterfly\u2019s at once. He, directly observing it, couldn\u2019t handle the deluge of possible outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026he bit off more than he could chew.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, more common than you\u2019d think. I got a few people who can communicate with me, mainly a half mad chronomancer, but this is the longest I\u2019ve talked in a while.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo\u2026I\u2019m an eldritch horror now?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of us being here though? If we\u2019re just making people insane, why did I get \u2018hired\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cOk, for one, we don\u2019t just make people go insane. We\u2019re a force for chaos. Without an outside force to push the ball around, a world gets stuck in fate. And that\u2019s, well, boring. So we shift some stuff around, get some people mad in both senses of the word, to spur change.\u201d\n\nWait.\n\n\u201cSo by that logic, does my world have eldritch gods?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh god no.

The ring of tin cans, rustle of old decaying garbage bags and the slapping of panicked shoes on concrete sounded into the night air.  Rebecca quickly turned her attention towards the disturbance as three young boys burst from between the buildings, turning and running in our direction as if being chased by the damned.\n\nBut of course they were.\n\nClose behind them was an undead.  In full sprint behind them.  Teeth gnashing, spilled blood staining it\u2019s mouth and clothes\u2026  mostly intact.  A well put together zombie considering the downfall of the local business district.\n\n\u201cRuuuuun!\u201d Shouted the lead boy as he and his fellows dashed away from the monster.  Rebecca took a quick skipping step to stand a few feet behind me, avoiding the scared group as they made their way past.  The slavering corpse only paces behind them.\n\nWell, what an opportunity, hmm?\n\nMy arm struck forward, palming that undead\u2019s face, halting it suddenly.  The momentum of it\u2019s body carried on, lifting it off it\u2019s feet.  Rebecca had called it being \u2018clothes lined\u2019 when she had seen me preform this months earlier.  Before gravity could assert itself, I thrust the zombie\u2019s head into the pavement.  With a crunching thud the body ceased it\u2019s movements, a splattered halo of gore ringing what was once it\u2019s skull\u2026  I pulled my hand away, noting how the ichor coating my hand was\u2026 warm\u2026  before wiping it on the cadaver\u2019s shirt.\n\n\u201cWell well well!  Seem\u2019s like it\u2019s your lucky day boys!\u201d\n\nOf course, Rebecca also recognized the opportunity and wasted no time.\n\nI turned, Rebecca had her hands on her hips, addressing the three boys that were standing at shouting distance from us now.  She was standing quite proudly for someone that hid behind me barely seconds ago.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not often that someone runs into a pair of zombie slayers!\u201d  I resisted the urge to roll my eyes.  She was working and it wouldn\u2019t do to correct her in the middle of her sales pitch.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for us that Zed would\u2019a gotten you for sure!  Infact, I\u2019d say it was pure luck ya ran into us. Yup yup, damn lucky!\u201d  Rebecca nodded to herself, in a way she might say was \u2018sagely\u2019.\n\nThe trio stood there, clutching bags of scavenged loot and gathering their wits as my companion continued.\n\n\u201cNow, I don\u2019t do this that often, but I think you guys might need the services of some experienced corpse kickers.  Some dead ringers.  A pair of cadaver killers.  Some bona-fied, boss level, zombie de-stroy-ers!\u201d  Rebecca crowed, laying it on thick to the slack jawed teens before they managed to regain their footing.\n\n\u201cY-you killed M-matt\u2026\u201d Stammered a shorter boy.  He was still catching his breath, his looted gains clanking in his bag.\n\n\u201cYes.  I am sorry for your friend.  I am assuming that he turned recently and attacked you.\u201d\n\nThe group looked at each other, not expecting my insight on their situation.\n\nThe oldest of the boys, doubtless the leader, looked at me suspiciously.  I cut him off before he could ask the question.  \u201cThe body still had the heat of life.  Still warm.  And the clothing is cleaner than would be expected of an undead\u201d\n\nThough, still warry, this seemed be enough for the leader.  He took some steadying breaths before continuing.  \u201cThanks for the help.  We appreciate it, but we\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?  Ya in a hurry, yeah?  Got an appointment someplace?\u201d I didn\u2019t even need to see her face, I knew Rebecca was smiling ear to ear.  She already knew what their answers were going to be.\n\n\u201cYeah, We\u2019re late.  Suns down and we gotta get this stuff back home.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh ho!  Home eh?  And where\u2019s that?  Maybe we could get you there safely, hmmm?\u201d\n\nThe boys looked at each other again.  The gears turning as they eyed us.  Then the cooling corpse of their turned friend.  Then back to us.  The lead boy seemed conflicted but made the decision to utilize our offered services.\n\nAn hour had passed and the young boys had led us to a\u2026  Truck Stop\u2026  is what I was told.  An area near the outskirts of the town.  An expanse of pavement and lamp posts is where the boys called home, our attention drawn to a short building\u2026  a dining establishment of some sort.  Surrounded by a ring of tipped over trailers.  The sort that were pulled by those large\u2026  trucks?  I suppose.  It was a reasonable defensive fortification.\n\nAnd it was being tested.\n\nDozens of the undead were clawing at the metal barricade, making no real progress\u2026  and that was only on this side of the fort.  I did not doubt that there were others we could not see from our current vantage.  I looked back at the three teens.  Seeing the trepidation in their faces.  \u201cRebecca.  I trust you can escort them inside?\u201d\n\nRebecca was virtually vibrating with excitement.  I can only assume it was from the prospect of the waiting resources behind those walls that had her in such a state.  \u201cYeah yeah yeah, I got\u2019em.  No problem!\u201d\n\nAnd with that preamble I strode out from behind the automobile we were crouched behind and began my grim work\u2026\n\nZombie are only attracted to the warmth and vigor of the living.  There is some sort of instinctual thirst that they crave.  An animalistic urge that I am not unfamiliar with\u2026  However, these undead lack intellect.  They are less than animals and I shed no metaphoric tears for them as I cleave them down.  They do not even take notice of me as I break them one by one.  Felling them like ugly, rotten trees\u2026  Smashing their heads by bouncing them on the pavement or simply plucking their skulls off their necks if they were decayed enough.\n\nI had half wished that they would respond to me if only to prevent this chore from being boring.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the last corpse had hit the ground did Rebecca leave her hiding spot, pushing the trio of boys from behind.  \u201cYa see!  Piece\u2019o cake!  Now we\u2019ll just get on in there, safe and sound!\u201d\n\nI kept watch, standing there in the muck and grime of the undead.  While I completed my task with nary a whisper, the noise of the zombie pounding on the metal trailers surely echoed across the paved lot and into the surroundings.  More of them would be on the way, attracted by the noise.\n\nIf not by the noisesome boasting of Rebecca as she ushered her charges toward their home.\n\nWe shortly found ourselves inside the fort.  I could indeed hear the banging of the corpses on the far end of the compound as I swept my gaze across the area.  Various styles of tents, shacks and other hovels were dotted around the place.  Scrap like ladders laid against the outer walls, allowing access for the defenders\u2026  My eyes focused on the people milling about.  Some staring at Rebecca or myself.  These were a mixed group of survivors.  Old and young, desperately sheltering in this ring of metal.  There was a noticeable lack of young adults and middle aged people\u2026\n\nIt was then that one of the only middle aged men bid my attention.\n\n\u201cThanks for your help, friend.  We appreciate you saving our young\u2019uns\u201d The man held out his hand for a shake.  Which I declined, holding my mess stained hands up and offering an apology.  \u201cBeg pardon, I am quite filthy\u201d\n\nTo his credit, the man did not immediately gag.  \u201cAh!  Right, we\u2019ll get you cleaned up!  Follow me.\u201d\n\nWe walked towards the building in the middle.  A yellow roofed affair with a sign declaring it some sort of waffle dwelling.  Inside, they offered a basin of water to cleanse my hands of ichor.  Rebecca took the opportunity to start negotiations.\n\n\u201cSo, ya guys seem to have a problem.  And you might have noticed that we\u2019re a pair of problem solvers!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I had noticed your friend taking apart zombies with is bare hands\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Frank is a zom slaying machine!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026Yeah\u2026  how did you manage that, Frank?\u201d\n\nI shook my hands dry as I corrected the man \u201cFranklin.  It\u2019s easy for someone of my line.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf your line?\u201d\n\n\u201cHoy hoy!  Let\u2019s not get sidetracked here.\u201d Rebecca crowed.  \u201cLets get to brass tacks, eh?  You\u2019ve got a corpse party bang\u2019n at your walls and we\u2019re in the business of shut\u2019n that kind\u2019a shit down.\u201d\n\nThe head man blinked slowly as he digested what was being offered.  \u201cAnd you want to help us out here.  Out of the goodness of your heart, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, absolutely not.  You\u2019re gonna pay us.  But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll just be some supplies\u2026  and\u2026\u201d  there was a long drawn out pause before she gave me a pointed look.\n\nI gave a heavy sigh before giving the man in charge a fake smile.  One that accentuated my fangs.\n\n\u201c\u2026And a blood tithe\u201d\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nAny suggestions or comments are appreciated", "index": "red10_s19_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red10_s19_c0_", "comment_text": "Original Writing Prompt post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1bzt6yy/wp\\_as\\_a\\_vampire\\_you\\_are\\_the\\_last\\_line\\_of\\_defense/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1bzt6yy/wp_as_a_vampire_you_are_the_last_line_of_defense/)\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\n\u201cWe are not calling it that.\u201d  I scoffed, shaking my head disapprovingly as my companion tried to convince me.\n\n\u201cC\u2019mon, you have to admit, blood tithe has a striking ring to it!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026it does at that.

He was still catching his breath, his looted gains clanking in his bag.\n\n\u201cYes.  I am sorry for your friend.  I am assuming that he turned recently and attacked you.\u201d\n\nThe group looked at each other, not expecting my insight on their situation.\n\nThe oldest of the boys, doubtless the leader, looked at me suspiciously.  I cut him off before he could ask the question.  \u201cThe body still had the heat of life.  Still warm.  And the clothing is cleaner than would be expected of an undead\u201d\n\nThough, still warry, this seemed be enough for the leader.  He took some steadying breaths before continuing.  \u201cThanks for the help.  We appreciate it, but we\u2019ve gotta go.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?  Ya in a hurry, yeah?  Got an appointment someplace?\u201d I didn\u2019t even need to see her face, I knew Rebecca was smiling ear to ear.  She already knew what their answers were going to be.\n\n\u201cYeah, We\u2019re late.  Suns down and we gotta get this stuff back home.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh ho!  Home eh?  And where\u2019s that?  Maybe we could get you there safely, hmmm?\u201d\n\nThe boys looked at each other again.  The gears turning as they eyed us.  Then the cooling corpse of their turned friend.  Then back to us.  The lead boy seemed conflicted but made the decision to utilize our offered services.\n\nAn hour had passed and the young boys had led us to a\u2026  Truck Stop\u2026  is what I was told.  An area near the outskirts of the town.  An expanse of pavement and lamp posts is where the boys called home, our attention drawn to a short building\u2026  a dining establishment of some sort.  Surrounded by a ring of tipped over trailers.  The sort that were pulled by those large\u2026  trucks?  I suppose.  It was a reasonable defensive fortification.\n\nAnd it was being tested.\n\nDozens of the undead were clawing at the metal barricade, making no real progress\u2026  and that was only on this side of the fort.  I did not doubt that there were others we could not see from our current vantage.  I looked back at the three teens.  Seeing the trepidation in their faces.  \u201cRebecca.  I trust you can escort them inside?\u201d\n\nRebecca was virtually vibrating with excitement.  I can only assume it was from the prospect of the waiting resources behind those walls that had her in such a state.  \u201cYeah yeah yeah, I got\u2019em.  No problem!\u201d\n\nAnd with that preamble I strode out from behind the automobile we were crouched behind and began my grim work\u2026\n\nZombie are only attracted to the warmth and vigor of the living.  There is some sort of instinctual thirst that they crave.  An animalistic urge that I am not unfamiliar with\u2026  However, these undead lack intellect.  They are less than animals and I shed no metaphoric tears for them as I cleave them down.  They do not even take notice of me as I break them one by one.  Felling them like ugly, rotten trees\u2026  Smashing their heads by bouncing them on the pavement or simply plucking their skulls off their necks if they were decayed enough.\n\nI had half wished that they would respond to me if only to prevent this chore from being boring.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the last corpse had hit the ground did Rebecca leave her hiding spot, pushing the trio of boys from behind.  \u201cYa see!  Piece\u2019o cake!  Now we\u2019ll just get on in there, safe and sound!\u201d\n\nI kept watch, standing there in the muck and grime of the undead.  While I completed my task with nary a whisper, the noise of the zombie pounding on the metal trailers surely echoed across the paved lot and into the surroundings.  More of them would be on the way, attracted by the noise.\n\nIf not by the noisesome boasting of Rebecca as she ushered her charges toward their home.\n\nWe shortly found ourselves inside the fort.  I could indeed hear the banging of the corpses on the far end of the compound as I swept my gaze across the area.  Various styles of tents, shacks and other hovels were dotted around the place.  Scrap like ladders laid against the outer walls, allowing access for the defenders\u2026  My eyes focused on the people milling about.  Some staring at Rebecca or myself.  These were a mixed group of survivors.  Old and young, desperately sheltering in this ring of metal.  There was a noticeable lack of young adults and middle aged people\u2026\n\nIt was then that one of the only middle aged men bid my attention.\n\n\u201cThanks for your help, friend.  We appreciate you saving our young\u2019uns\u201d The man held out his hand for a shake.  Which I declined, holding my mess stained hands up and offering an apology.  \u201cBeg pardon, I am quite filthy\u201d\n\nTo his credit, the man did not immediately gag.  \u201cAh!  Right, we\u2019ll get you cleaned up!  Follow me.\u201d\n\nWe walked towards the building in the middle.  A yellow roofed affair with a sign declaring it some sort of waffle dwelling.  Inside, they offered a basin of water to cleanse my hands of ichor.  Rebecca took the opportunity to start negotiations.\n\n\u201cSo, ya guys seem to have a problem.  And you might have noticed that we\u2019re a pair of problem solvers!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I had noticed your friend taking apart zombies with is bare hands\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Frank is a zom slaying machine!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026Yeah\u2026  how did you manage that, Frank?\u201d\n\nI shook my hands dry as I corrected the man \u201cFranklin.  It\u2019s easy for someone of my line.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf your line?\u201d\n\n\u201cHoy hoy!  Let\u2019s not get sidetracked here.\u201d Rebecca crowed.  \u201cLets get to brass tacks, eh?  You\u2019ve got a corpse party bang\u2019n at your walls and we\u2019re in the business of shut\u2019n that kind\u2019a shit down.\u201d\n\nThe head man blinked slowly as he digested what was being offered.  \u201cAnd you want to help us out here.  Out of the goodness of your heart, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, absolutely not.  You\u2019re gonna pay us.  But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll just be some supplies\u2026  and\u2026\u201d  there was a long drawn out pause before she gave me a pointed look.\n\nI gave a heavy sigh before giving the man in charge a fake smile.  One that accentuated my fangs.\n\n\u201c\u2026And a blood tithe\u201d\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nAny suggestions or comments are appreciated", "comment_created_utc": 1714501887.0, "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Post!** This is a [\\[PI\\] Prompt Inspired](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/how_to_tag_prompts#wiki_pi.3A_prompt_inspired) post which means it's a response to a prompt here on /r/WritingPrompts or /r/promptoftheday.  \n\n**Reminder**:\n\n>[Be civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_10.3A_be_civil) in any feedback provided in the comments.\n\n&#128226; [Genres](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/w/directory) \n&#127381; [New Here?](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/user_guide) \n&#9999; [Writing Help?](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/index#wiki_writing_resources) \n&#128172; [Discord](https://discord.gg/writingprompts)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
