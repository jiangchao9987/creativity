Previously I was thinking that, if my next doctor's appointment does not go well, I might pull the trigger on that plan.  But it is being complicated somewhat by my father in law's dementia diagnosis, and our newly found desire to move down to where he is in order to help.\n\nMortgage rates are such that even a reasonably priced house will double our housing costs, and paying for the house outright is potentially an option but has complications around draining our taxable savings, which was going to be my runway for that year off (and also we would have to pay a potentially large amount of taxes to pull it off).  Also if I left my job, I imagine even getting a mortgage would be difficult.\n\nI will also admit that I am only now finally feeling like I am hitting my stride in my new position, and that feels good after a few years of treading water and feeling like I made a huge mistake by changing careers.  It doesn't feel good enough to prioritize it over my health when I really stop and think about it, but I also feel like I might regret it or not be able to get back in if I find I miss it once I get myself into a better place physically.\n\nI have found that with the hectic nature of my job combined with taking care of the kid, developing a healthcare routine that I can stick to has been rough, which is what makes me think about taking the drastic step of walking away from work to focus on it and perhaps get myself to a new, healthier \"plateau\" that maybe I could then sustain with less concentrated effort.\n\nI am trying to think through what to do with all these factors in mind.

That's it.  That was enough to make all the sacrifice worthwhile.\n\nI have cerebral palsy.  I spent the first 7 years of my adult life living *well* below the poverty line.  I graduated during the great recession, and that time left me *riddled* with anxiety.  I really struggled with imposter syndrome.  I just knew it was a matter of time until I was laid off and could never work in the field again.  Given my disability, I couldn't do like most guys I knew and go work a trade.  I also couldn't go back on SSI with a college degree.  I literally used to calculate how long I could live out of my truck, because that seemed like a very real possibility.\n\nSo I worked my *ass* off.  I worked crazy hours, and then came home and studied datastructures, algorithms and design patterns to make myself a better dev.  I was used to living lean on disability, so while I inflated my spending a little (groceries and books!) I saved most of my salary cause I figured any day now the jig would be up.\n\nEventually, the money started accumulating so I started investing it.  Life went on this way, with little milestones until my mid 30's when I *finally* crossed the FI threshold.  I had been working towards this for a decade, but oddly, it wasn't any big event for me.  There is just this subtle feeling of contentment and gratitude.  It took a while for it to sink in that I was genuinely 'safe'.\n\nIt's been about 5 years since then, and each time I go in to update my little program, I get a little 'zap' of happiness.  I've moved beyond being able to afford my basic needs to pretty much all my 'wants' as well.

In my opinion, it's unnecessary.  If they put that money into a 529 and paid the $120/year for recreational sports, they would probably save all the money they need for college.  But that is a completely personal decision.  On the other hand, some parents do it for other reasons: they think it is important for their kids' development of leadership skills, they want to be involved as coaches, they like sports, etc.  \n\nMy kids (one in HS, one in college) have both been involved in several school activities, primarily marching band, which is much less costly than a travel sports program and has given them leadership opportunities.

And I\u2019m difficult, and you said my having kids would be some sort of revenge:  After hearing all that dozens to hundreds of times growing up, WHY the f**** would I want to be miserable like apparently YOU are?\n\nThen she backpedaled and claimed she was \u201cjoking\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t mean it\u201d blah blah blah.  Well she was \u201cjoking\u201d but I\u2019m not.\n\nSo though you say kids are \u201cexpensive\u201d, don\u2019t fling it in their faces.  Sure times can get tight, but it\u2019s a team effort - you\u2019re all in it together.\n\nI didn\u2019t cost Mom much except at school clothes time.  She spent lavishly on my older brother but as little as possible on me, and apparently even that was too much.\n\nKids grow, and grow out of clothes fast.  I suggest you shop at second hand stores especially for things they\u2019re going to play hard in.  Save the new stuff for Sunday, special events, and holidays.\n\nShoes are expensive.  No way around that.  Dad said he wore his older brother\u2019s shoes until he joined the Army at 17.  That was the first new pair of shoes he\u2019d ever had.\n\nActivities - sports, gymnastics, dance, horseback riding, shooting, training for ANYTHING pretty much - can be expensive.\n\nTutoring (if necessary) is expensive.\n\nMusic lessons are expensive.\n\nTravel activities - my high school had a French Club that got to travel to France, a German Club that visited Germany, and a Spanish club that visited Spain.  These were all funded by the students\u2019 families and a few fundraising activities.  The whole class did NOT go - only the rich kids whose parents could pay any extra.\n\nKids eat.  Don\u2019t eat out, make most of your food, and it\u2019s OK.\n\nKids are expensive.  That\u2019s how it is. Get family to cover as much childcare as you can.  Don\u2019t leave them with priests.  Don\u2019t leave them in a situation where only one person is supervising.  And go to all their activities - games, recitals, performances, awards ceremonies.  \n\nMy mother never saw me receive an award (And I earned many) though she was always there for my brother when he so much as farted.  So if you\u2019re going to spend money on your kids, be FAIR.\n\nI suggest you budget FAIRLY and realize that though spending may not be exactly equal, you can still be fair and make sure all get what they need, even if they don\u2019t all get what they want.\n\nDecades later the bitterness will linger.  Don\u2019t be like my Mom.

So you need $5000ish to cover most of the summer. \n\nSummer camps for older kids/teens to pursue special interests (coding camp, filmmaking camp, etc) are also similarly expensive but you don\u2019t need them for full time care since the kid can be independent some days/weeks of the summer. My teens also mixed in things like summer classes from the local community college (graphic design, American Sign Language) which were inexpensive ($50/class) and also online classes from Udemy, etc. \n\nAge 16 and up it\u2019s easier for them to get jobs as their summer activity (many places don\u2019t hire under age 16). \n\nFashion takes some special consideration.

And they are so hard on shoes, constantly on the go\u2014my kids wear out Converse in 2 months with all the walking around they do. Plan to spend $500 per year per kid on shoes when they are in high school. I think my daughters have been fairly non-demanding about fashion (again, thrifting!) and I still spend $1000/year per daughter on clothes (not shoes) since their bodies are changing, their self-expression is changing, they wear stuff out, etc.\n\nSpecialty activities like sports or debate team for older kids. I think costs can range a lot but gear, travel, uniforms, etc add up. My kid does debate which requires some overnight travel (hotels, flights) to tournaments and dues to pay for coaching. Super worth it but this special interest costs a couple thousand per year. \n\nTests and college applications: PSAT, SAT, AP exams charge fees to take those tests, every college you apply to costs a little over $100. I\u2019ve gone through the college application process with one kid and she applied to 8 universities (that\u2019s normal: a few stretch schools, a few target schools and a few back up schools) so that cost $900. \n\nMy kids didn\u2019t have tutoring, but some students benefit from that and it would be another expense. \n\nNon-family travel: they might go on cool ass high school field trips.

It's me!\n\n..well, not exactly. BUT this really resonates with me. I'm quite a bit behind you in terms of NW (around $350k for my wife and I between individual investment account and retirement accounts). Not doing the kid thing, just us. Around 40 years old. Currently doing fulltime vanlife, but planning on buying something in the next yera / househacking for a subsidized property (hopefully free, if not generating a tiny bit of income from rent). $200k total W2 income, and maybe $10k **reportable** income per year from a side hustle.\n\nLately I'm just.. checked out, you know? Like I'm doing good at work, but I'm only putting in around 10 hours/week of REAL effort, plus another 10h / week of meetings. I could probably do a bit more, but it's easier to delegate to the guys who report to me. But I can't bring myself to CARE enough to do more, esp. since my company just refused to do any annual comp increases for people who gets profit share bonuses.\n\nOur FIRE number is $1.5m, *maybe* $1.25m depending on where we land with a househack situation. Our CoastFIRE number is around $800k. At this rate of savings (maxing out tax advantageous accounts, plus around $2500 to $3500/mo into VTI) we should be able to hit the $1.25m number in around 5 to 8 years, depending on how aggressive we are with savings - [see chart here](https://engaging-data.com/fire-calculator/?age=38&initsav=350000&spend=40000&initinc=160000&wr=4&ir=1&retspend=45750&stockpct=90&fixpct=8&cashpct=2&graph=fix&secgraph=0&stockrtn=8.1&bondrtn=2.4&MCstockrtn=0.081&MCbondrtn=0.024&tax=7&income=&incstart=50&incend=70&expense=0&expstart=50&expend=70).

{"post_title": "4 months into early retirement. A story of my journey so far...", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1cgbyi6/4_months_into_early_retirement_a_story_of_my/", "created_utc": 1714428344.0, "text": "**Background:** You can find a detailed background of my story [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/18n6wcs/fired_after_26_years_i_resigned_today/).  In brief it tells the story of how I got to $6m net worth and retired at 45years old.  Below is my latest update 4 months into retirement.\n\n**Portfolio performance:** Net worth over the last 90 days since my last update has increased from $6,453,452 to $6,596,541 that's an increase of about $140,000 in three months or about $45,000 per month on average.  The mix is made up from low cost broad based index funds and some real estate.\n\n**Real Estate:** I was not looking, but my mentor is retiring and getting rid of a few properties.  I was able to acquire one from them at a \\~15% discount.  I had to make some concessions and accommodate them for the good deal, as an experienced investor I was able to close in 10 days, no inspection contingency and acquired the property as is.  Not only that, but I got a loan which I will pay off in 12\u201318 months.  By getting the loan, I can keep my MAGI low, while also not having to touch the stock portfolio.  The loan is around 2% of net worth, even at 8% interest this is immaterial as I can pay it off quickly.  As a business loan, the interest is also fully tax-deductible.\n\n**Mentoring Impact:** As part of this process, I was also able to help one of my mentees acquire a property which was off market at a very reasonable price.  They are now in the throes of improving it.  They seem to be having so much fun bringing it back to life.  It's amazing to watch the progress, their triumphs and challenges.  Their mistakes and hard won lessons learned.  They remind me of my early days in real estate and in investing in general.  If they carry the same momentum, this young man and his partner, will likely retire 10 years before I was able to with much less stress than what I went through.\n\n**Personal Spending** has been in accordance with my estimates, with the exception, of the loan for the property acquisition.  Average monthly spending for the past 4 months has been around $4000 per month and about $16,000 in 4 months.  Its mainly comprising travel $8500, food $2200, medical $1200, gas $450, utilities $650, electronics $800, discretionary $500, reserve $1200, others $500.  Our food costs are super low as we enjoy our home cooking way more than any restaurant food.  I'm projecting personal spending of between 60,000 and 75,000 this year.  That amount is about $10,000 less than the worst-case scenario of $85,000.  $85K would be a withdrawal rate of 1.3%.  Most of the budget is discretionary and based on suggestions from many, I have been learning to increase spending within reason as I have always been naturally frugal.  \n\n**Health and fun:**  Working on losing weight slowly over time.  Started at 195lbs.  Currently, after about 9 weeks, I have lost about 12 pounds.  I have been exercising every day by running between 1.5 and 4 miles on the treadmill every day.  I'm averaging about 18,000 steps per day sometimes more.  I'm also planning to bike 1000 miles this year.  So far I have biked about 265 miles, mainly on the beach, around the local neighborhood and occasionally in a few nearby state parks and forests. I've also been learning how to build and fly drones.  It has been super fun and gets me outside.\n\n**Highlights:**  Losing 12 pounds!  It has been an effort eating better food, more sleep, more exercise but it has been worth it and a rewarding experience. Not missing the corporate job at all.  As an introvert, I find I'm also not missing the people either.  Busier than ever doing all the things in my bucket list and little projects.  Doing a lot of programming work and improving my garden.  So far I have avocadoes, peaches, oranges, grapes, loquats, and other fruit trees planted.\n\n**Surprises**\n\n1. I did not expect I'd enjoy exercising as much as I do.  In January this year, when I retired, I weighed about 195 pounds and today I'm about 183. \n2. I realize I need to slow down so I don't hurt myself with all the DIY projects.  It would be a shame to have all this time and have to spend most of it recovering from injuries.\n3. I thought I really would miss work and the people there, but to be very honest, I miss neither.  I wish them well, though.\n\n**What's coming up:**  A big international trip (We have planned a trip of around 20,000 miles with the family over the summer to spend lots of quality time but also to just relax.).  Will also do some volunteer work overseas. Looking forward to helping, remaining humble and perhaps learning new skills.  I hope to interact and continue working with my mentees, I learn so much from them.  I have been working on some coding projects using microcomputer boards and doing many automation projects.  What an intellectual challenge but so thrilling when I get things working.  My life is fast becoming less about focusing on the FIRE goal and more delving into that pursuit of joy and mindfulness.\n\n**Final Reflections:  Luck plays a big role** in everything, but it does not replace self-discipline, delayed gratification, continuous learning, growing and helping enough people resolve their problems so they can help you resolve your own.  Hoping to do another update in a month or so. It is going to take time to settle into the new routine, but I have been amazed by how time has flown by.  I am thankful every day for the opportunity I was able to achieve in order to escape the matrix. Read bits of a book about principles and in summary it had some lessons which really resonated for me.  It seems they are universal lessons to live by, before and after FIRE.  The summary of it revolved around learning to:\n\n1. Not worry about looking good.  Worry about reaching your goal.\n2. Realizing you do not know everything, but there is so much information and resources that can help you make better radical decisions.\n3. Self-introspection, empathy and humility are key principles to a successful radically different life.\n\nLike Jim Rohn used to say:  **\"Don't be a follower.  Be a student.\"**  Students learn, then make up their own minds.  Looking forward to updating you guys in a few weeks or a few months' time as time is flying by!  I'm not selling anything.

Do you include your primary residence in your NW? What\u2019s your take on carrying debt into early retirement? Any plans for changing your portfolio allocation?", "reply_created_utc": 1714430089.0}, {"index": "red1_s5_c2_", "comment_text": "**Background:** You can find a detailed background of my story [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/18n6wcs/fired_after_26_years_i_resigned_today/).  In brief it tells the story of how I got to $6m net worth and retired at 45years old.  Below is my latest update 4 months into retirement.\n\n**Portfolio performance:** Net worth over the last 90 days since my last update has increased from $6,453,452 to $6,596,541 that's an increase of about $140,000 in three months or about $45,000 per month on average.  The mix is made up from low cost broad based index funds and some real estate.\n\n**Real Estate:** I was not looking, but my mentor is retiring and getting rid of a few properties.  I was able to acquire one from them at a \\~15% discount.  I had to make some concessions and accommodate them for the good deal, as an experienced investor I was able to close in 10 days, no inspection contingency and acquired the property as is.  Not only that, but I got a loan which I will pay off in 12\u201318 months.  By getting the loan, I can keep my MAGI low, while also not having to touch the stock portfolio.  The loan is around 2% of net worth, even at 8% interest this is immaterial as I can pay it off quickly.  As a business loan, the interest is also fully tax-deductible.\n\n**Mentoring Impact:** As part of this process, I was also able to help one of my mentees acquire a property which was off market at a very reasonable price.  They are now in the throes of improving it.  They seem to be having so much fun bringing it back to life.  It's amazing to watch the progress, their triumphs and challenges.  Their mistakes and hard won lessons learned.  They remind me of my early days in real estate and in investing in general.  If they carry the same momentum, this young man and his partner, will likely retire 10 years before I was able to with much less stress than what I went through.\n\n**Personal Spending** has been in accordance with my estimates, with the exception, of the loan for the property acquisition.  Average monthly spending for the past 4 months has been around $4000 per month and about $16,000 in 4 months.  Its mainly comprising travel $8500, food $2200, medical $1200, gas $450, utilities $650, electronics $800, discretionary $500, reserve $1200, others $500.  Our food costs are super low as we enjoy our home cooking way more than any restaurant food.  I'm projecting personal spending of between 60,000 and 75,000 this year.  That amount is about $10,000 less than the worst-case scenario of $85,000.  $85K would be a withdrawal rate of 1.3%.  Most of the budget is discretionary and based on suggestions from many, I have been learning to increase spending within reason as I have always been naturally frugal.  \n\n**Health and fun:**  Working on losing weight slowly over time.  Started at 195lbs.  Currently, after about 9 weeks, I have lost about 12 pounds.  I have been exercising every day by running between 1.5 and 4 miles on the treadmill every day.  I'm averaging about 18,000 steps per day sometimes more.  I'm also planning to bike 1000 miles this year.  So far I have biked about 265 miles, mainly on the beach, around the local neighborhood and occasionally in a few nearby state parks and forests. I've also been learning how to build and fly drones.  It has been super fun and gets me outside.\n\n**Highlights:**  Losing 12 pounds!  It has been an effort eating better food, more sleep, more exercise but it has been worth it and a rewarding experience. Not missing the corporate job at all.  As an introvert, I find I'm also not missing the people either.  Busier than ever doing all the things in my bucket list and little projects.  Doing a lot of programming work and improving my garden.  So far I have avocadoes, peaches, oranges, grapes, loquats, and other fruit trees planted.\n\n**Surprises**\n\n1. I did not expect I'd enjoy exercising as much as I do.  In January this year, when I retired, I weighed about 195 pounds and today I'm about 183. \n2. I realize I need to slow down so I don't hurt myself with all the DIY projects.  It would be a shame to have all this time and have to spend most of it recovering from injuries.\n3. I thought I really would miss work and the people there, but to be very honest, I miss neither.  I wish them well, though.\n\n**What's coming up:**  A big international trip (We have planned a trip of around 20,000 miles with the family over the summer to spend lots of quality time but also to just relax.).  Will also do some volunteer work overseas. Looking forward to helping, remaining humble and perhaps learning new skills.

I had to make some concessions and accommodate them for the good deal, as an experienced investor I was able to close in 10 days, no inspection contingency and acquired the property as is.  Not only that, but I got a loan which I will pay off in 12\u201318 months.  By getting the loan, I can keep my MAGI low, while also not having to touch the stock portfolio.  The loan is around 2% of net worth, even at 8% interest this is immaterial as I can pay it off quickly.  As a business loan, the interest is also fully tax-deductible.\n\n**Mentoring Impact:** As part of this process, I was also able to help one of my mentees acquire a property which was off market at a very reasonable price.  They are now in the throes of improving it.  They seem to be having so much fun bringing it back to life.  It's amazing to watch the progress, their triumphs and challenges.  Their mistakes and hard won lessons learned.  They remind me of my early days in real estate and in investing in general.  If they carry the same momentum, this young man and his partner, will likely retire 10 years before I was able to with much less stress than what I went through.\n\n**Personal Spending** has been in accordance with my estimates, with the exception, of the loan for the property acquisition.  Average monthly spending for the past 4 months has been around $4000 per month and about $16,000 in 4 months.  Its mainly comprising travel $8500, food $2200, medical $1200, gas $450, utilities $650, electronics $800, discretionary $500, reserve $1200, others $500.  Our food costs are super low as we enjoy our home cooking way more than any restaurant food.  I'm projecting personal spending of between 60,000 and 75,000 this year.  That amount is about $10,000 less than the worst-case scenario of $85,000.  $85K would be a withdrawal rate of 1.3%.  Most of the budget is discretionary and based on suggestions from many, I have been learning to increase spending within reason as I have always been naturally frugal.  \n\n**Health and fun:**  Working on losing weight slowly over time.  Started at 195lbs.  Currently, after about 9 weeks, I have lost about 12 pounds.  I have been exercising every day by running between 1.5 and 4 miles on the treadmill every day.  I'm averaging about 18,000 steps per day sometimes more.  I'm also planning to bike 1000 miles this year.  So far I have biked about 265 miles, mainly on the beach, around the local neighborhood and occasionally in a few nearby state parks and forests. I've also been learning how to build and fly drones.  It has been super fun and gets me outside.\n\n**Highlights:**  Losing 12 pounds!  It has been an effort eating better food, more sleep, more exercise but it has been worth it and a rewarding experience. Not missing the corporate job at all.  As an introvert, I find I'm also not missing the people either.  Busier than ever doing all the things in my bucket list and little projects.  Doing a lot of programming work and improving my garden.  So far I have avocadoes, peaches, oranges, grapes, loquats, and other fruit trees planted.\n\n**Surprises**\n\n1. I did not expect I'd enjoy exercising as much as I do.  In January this year, when I retired, I weighed about 195 pounds and today I'm about 183. \n2. I realize I need to slow down so I don't hurt myself with all the DIY projects.  It would be a shame to have all this time and have to spend most of it recovering from injuries.\n3. I thought I really would miss work and the people there, but to be very honest, I miss neither.  I wish them well, though.\n\n**What's coming up:**  A big international trip (We have planned a trip of around 20,000 miles with the family over the summer to spend lots of quality time but also to just relax.).  Will also do some volunteer work overseas. Looking forward to helping, remaining humble and perhaps learning new skills.  I hope to interact and continue working with my mentees, I learn so much from them.  I have been working on some coding projects using microcomputer boards and doing many automation projects.  What an intellectual challenge but so thrilling when I get things working.  My life is fast becoming less about focusing on the FIRE goal and more delving into that pursuit of joy and mindfulness.\n\n**Final Reflections:  Luck plays a big role** in everything, but it does not replace self-discipline, delayed gratification, continuous learning, growing and helping enough people resolve their problems so they can help you resolve your own.  Hoping to do another update in a month or so. It is going to take time to settle into the new routine, but I have been amazed by how time has flown by.  I am thankful every day for the opportunity I was able to achieve in order to escape the matrix. Read bits of a book about principles and in summary it had some lessons which really resonated for me.  It seems they are universal lessons to live by, before and after FIRE.  The summary of it revolved around learning to:\n\n1. Not worry about looking good.  Worry about reaching your goal.\n2. Realizing you do not know everything, but there is so much information and resources that can help you make better radical decisions.\n3. Self-introspection, empathy and humility are key principles to a successful radically different life.\n\nLike Jim Rohn used to say:  **\"Don't be a follower.  Be a student.\"**  Students learn, then make up their own minds.  Looking forward to updating you guys in a few weeks or a few months' time as time is flying by!  I'm not selling anything.

I wish them well, though.\n\n**What's coming up:**  A big international trip (We have planned a trip of around 20,000 miles with the family over the summer to spend lots of quality time but also to just relax.).  Will also do some volunteer work overseas. Looking forward to helping, remaining humble and perhaps learning new skills.  I hope to interact and continue working with my mentees, I learn so much from them.  I have been working on some coding projects using microcomputer boards and doing many automation projects.

My life is fast becoming less about focusing on the FIRE goal and more delving into that pursuit of joy and mindfulness.\n\n**Final Reflections:  Luck plays a big role** in everything, but it does not replace self-discipline, delayed gratification, continuous learning, growing and helping enough people resolve their problems so they can help you resolve your own.  Hoping to do another update in a month or so. It is going to take time to settle into the new routine, but I have been amazed by how time has flown by.  I am thankful every day for the opportunity I was able to achieve in order to escape the matrix. Read bits of a book about principles and in summary it had some lessons which really resonated for me.  It seems they are universal lessons to live by, before and after FIRE.

Realizing you do not know everything, but there is so much information and resources that can help you make better radical decisions.\n3. Self-introspection, empathy and humility are key principles to a successful radically different life.\n\nLike Jim Rohn used to say:  **\"Don't be a follower.

In brief it tells the story of how I got to $6m net worth and retired at 45years old.  Below is my latest update 4 months into retirement.\n\n**Portfolio performance:** Net worth over the last 90 days since my last update has increased from $6,453,452 to $6,596,541 that's an increase of about $140,000 in three months or about $45,000 per month on average.  The mix is made up from low cost broad based index funds and some real estate.\n\n**Real Estate:** I was not looking, but my mentor is retiring and getting rid of a few properties.  I was able to acquire one from them at a \\~15% discount.  I had to make some concessions and accommodate them for the good deal, as an experienced investor I was able to close in 10 days, no inspection contingency and acquired the property as is.  Not only that, but I got a loan which I will pay off in 12\u201318 months.  By getting the loan, I can keep my MAGI low, while also not having to touch the stock portfolio.  The loan is around 2% of net worth, even at 8% interest this is immaterial as I can pay it off quickly.  As a business loan, the interest is also fully tax-deductible.\n\n**Mentoring Impact:** As part of this process, I was also able to help one of my mentees acquire a property which was off market at a very reasonable price.  They are now in the throes of improving it.  They seem to be having so much fun bringing it back to life.  It's amazing to watch the progress, their triumphs and challenges.  Their mistakes and hard won lessons learned.  They remind me of my early days in real estate and in investing in general.  If they carry the same momentum, this young man and his partner, will likely retire 10 years before I was able to with much less stress than what I went through.\n\n**Personal Spending** has been in accordance with my estimates, with the exception, of the loan for the property acquisition.  Average monthly spending for the past 4 months has been around $4000 per month and about $16,000 in 4 months.  Its mainly comprising travel $8500, food $2200, medical $1200, gas $450, utilities $650, electronics $800, discretionary $500, reserve $1200, others $500.  Our food costs are super low as we enjoy our home cooking way more than any restaurant food.  I'm projecting personal spending of between 60,000 and 75,000 this year.  That amount is about $10,000 less than the worst-case scenario of $85,000.  $85K would be a withdrawal rate of 1.3%.  Most of the budget is discretionary and based on suggestions from many, I have been learning to increase spending within reason as I have always been naturally frugal.  \n\n**Health and fun:**  Working on losing weight slowly over time.  Started at 195lbs.  Currently, after about 9 weeks, I have lost about 12 pounds.  I have been exercising every day by running between 1.5 and 4 miles on the treadmill every day.  I'm averaging about 18,000 steps per day sometimes more.  I'm also planning to bike 1000 miles this year.  So far I have biked about 265 miles, mainly on the beach, around the local neighborhood and occasionally in a few nearby state parks and forests. I've also been learning how to build and fly drones.  It has been super fun and gets me outside.\n\n**Highlights:**  Losing 12 pounds!

If I'm reading this correctly, you are both in your early 30s, live in a VHCOL area, make about 200k per year (combined?) but you somehow have 793 THOUSAND dollars sitting in cash???? Also, you've been working for what seems like 7-10 years yet don't have any employer retirement accounts? No 401k, no HSA, nothing. This may be the strangest asset allocation I've ever seen from a young couple worth 900k. My guess is, since you mentioned reinvesting into a business, that you are self employed / work for family in a small business that generates a lot of cash flow, or something like that. \n\nThe bottom line is you have somehow missed an opportunity to invest a lot of the cash over the last 7-10 years and have missed out on historically great market growth. That's ok. The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, the next best time is right now. I'd definitely start DCA that cash into low cost index funds ASAP. Not sure your employment situation but fully funding a 401k or getting access to an HSA should also be a priority. You're right to open an IRA for your partner and max that out as well but not sure about your decision to switch from traditional to Roth, as you may be over the income limit for Roth contributions in the near future.\n\nAs far as saving for a house down-payment / wedding, I think you probably have at least 3x what you would need so I'd start putting that army of dollar bills to work ASAP and you'll have more than enough when it comes time to make those decisions.", "reply_created_utc": 1714356295.0}, {"index": "red1_s8_c1_", "comment_text": "Hi all,\n\nMy partner and I are in a good spot, but we're trying to get more financially literate.

When I started studying I kept having this temporary part time jobs to have some money for me and I wasn't taking any money from my parents for clothing, food, going out, education expenditures etc, but I was also living rent free and didn't pay bills for electricity and water, which helped a lot... At first I saved 2/3 of earnings, then I was living off savings for quite a long time, but managed to keep fluidity and solid safety cash pillow.\n\nThen (before I finished education, but after I got my permanent contract in desired field - still on part time) I moved to my BF also rent free - he proposed it, he was renting a small room in shared apartment at that time. \nAfter a year of living together, several raises on my part and switching to full time, we found very nice, 1-bedroom 45m2 apartament almost outside the city with cheap rent - probably because it wasn't fully furnished, which wasn't problem at all. At that time I earned ~6000 PLN/month, rent was 1500 PLN/month which splitted equally was 12.5% of my income, so I was able to save half.\n\nIn the same time I bought apartament on early construction stage - it was cheaper due to that + I have time to save more money and take lower mortage... We moved there after around 1.5 year, taking starter furniture with us. Cost of livings raised, but at that time I was also already earning more and was still able to save the half, especially with low mortage installment which was later even lower, because after COVID I got scared and change mortgage period from initial 10 years to 30 years to have low installment in case od financial problems - but I'm still making huge overpayments (half of my income) which I count as investments/saving, because I don't need this money for living. \n\nI'm over 30 now and still to this day I don't own my own car, which saves me a lot of money - I live in a big city, I'm working mostly remotely, when I go out I'm using bike, taxi or public transport.\nHowever I'm a co owner of my BF car - when he was upgrading I doubled his budget but I'm not participating in any maintenance cost. We are using it for visiting family outside of town, shopping and vacations.\n\nFrom couple years we are owning a 2 cats and they are stretch on a budget, but they are definately worth it \ud83d\ude0d\n\nI'm earning enough to live comfortably from other half - I'm even hiring cleaning services ~2x monthly, paying for PT which is quite expensive so I almost don't need to worry for money currently (however I'm still budgeting it - if I wouldn't keep eye on it it would be very easy to overspend)\n\nSo except following the rules you can see in my story also being very priviledged and lucky - so don't be harsh for yourself if you can't repeat this results, sometimes it's just not possible", "reply_created_utc": 1714375372.0}, {"index": "red1_s10_c68_", "comment_text": "As the title says I am just impressed with how today people can save that much.

I packed my lunch every day and said no to a lot of activities/outings with the few friends I had unless it was something I deemed frugal enough. \n\nI was pretty hardcore \u201cI\u2019m gonna retire super young and save/invest every penny I can and live like a broke college student as long as I can\u201d. \n\nSince then our incomes have gone up but we also have a dog and a baby on the way. We own a house and rent a house (longer story), COL has increased, and we happily spend money on things that make us happy. We are pretty happy if we hit a 35% monthly savings rate.

I also had a career where I was able to increase my income significantly over time, which let me save very aggressively early on. Here are some examples of the frugality:\n\n* I did not own a car from 2008 \u2013 2016. I used public transit in a big city and took cabs.  This is huge. Cars are a HUGE cost. Now that I do have a car, the car is my number one source of random $1000 bills.\n* When I did buy a car I paid cash and got the cheapest decent used car I could find.\n* I lived with roommates or in the cheapest 1 br apartments I could find from 2008 - 2017. This let me crank my savings rate up very high because housing is typically the largest living cost. At one point i was spending only 5% of my net income on rent!\n* Avoid any unnecessary bills. Spotify, Netflx, Amazon Prime, etc. They do add up when you have a bunch of them.\n* I just never bought nice stuff when I was younger. People in their 20s always feel pressure to buy a nice car, a nice watch, fancy $1000 iPhone, etc. I never did any of that. I have had basic stuff for most of my adult life. \n* Don't \"go shopping\", be strategic with your purchases \n* Pick hobbies that save you money or are very cheap. I learned how to cook and made that one of my hobbies. I play kickball in the park in a free group. \n* I don't go out to bars or drink much. I have a fancy gym membership instead, and spend most days there instead of spending money at the bar/restaurants.", "reply_created_utc": 1714460844.0}, {"index": "red1_s10_c125_", "comment_text": "As the title says I am just impressed with how today people can save that much.

Any tips or advice?", "comment_created_utc": 1714321618.0, "reply_text": "The answer is fairly simple (if not easy):  Make a lot of money, but spend like people who don't.  \n\nAlso bear in mind that standard usage of savings rate in this community is post tax, but some people don't calculate it that way.  If you're calculating pre-tax, it's almost impossible to get to 70%+, since at high incomes you're typically paying 20-30% of your income in taxes alone.   If you have a 30-35% pre-tax savings rate, that could easily be 50% *post tax*.\n\nSo that might be the issue.   The other issue might be that you make a relatively normal/average income and not a very high one. \n\nIt's a whole lot easier to save 50-70% when you make a top decile income than if you make something like 70-80k.   Saving 50-60% when you make 150-200k is living like a \"normal person\" who makes a comfortable middle class wage. Saving 50-60% when you make 75k (still a well above average income for one person) is living like somebody who just barely makes a living wage.   Saving 50% on a median wage is living like somebody who isn't far above the poverty level (with the caveat that life for someone who makes 40-50k and has \"near poverty level\" spending is a lot more comfortable and secure than most people who only make just enough above to poverty level to not get various welfare benefits like SNAP and Medicaid).\n\nSo advice is going to depend a lot on your situation.  If you make a very high income in anything but the highest cost areas, the answer is to figure out some stuff you've been buying that you don't really need, because there's plenty of it.\n\nIf you make a lower income, the answer may be to aggressively pursue more income if that's realistic.  Or it might be to satisfy yourself with a lower savings rate and longer FI timeline (30-35% still means you can retire very early if you aren't already approaching middle age when you start).", "reply_created_utc": 1714484852.0}, {"index": "red1_s10_c127_", "comment_text": "As the title says I am just impressed with how today people can save that much.

I have been using the Rich Broke or Dead calculator for some simple case studies as it allows you to add in income at certain points.  My takeaway is that with SSI benefits included, the 4% rule can be stretched to the 4.5% rule.  Basically, you can withdraw 4.5% early in retirement (in your 50s) which is then offset by reduced withdrawals later in life due to aging (less travel, etc) and SSI benefits.  I've even heard some say 5%, but that might depend on just how much SSI will cover of your annual spend.  The more it will cover, the larger % you can withdraw earlier.  For my calcs, SSI would cover 40% of my expenses at 65.  But if you could live 100% off of SSI, then you could hypothetically withdraw all of your retirement savings between 55 and 62-70 and live on SSI thereafter...not recommended though!\n\nEDIT:  I see you used Rich Broke or Dead as well.

Most of the stuff they eat is homemade, so it's a much healthier standard American diet than most folks eat.  They'll figure out what works best for them as adults.  Our teenage daughter has elected to join us in keto/carnivore land for the last two months and is really enjoying it.\n\nMy wife and I fluctuate between carnivore and keto depending on what happens to appeal at any given time.  I'd say we're baseline carnivore, but we go through seasonal waves of eating lots of salads and soups heavy with veg.\n\nWe make effectively all of our food from scratch, so for the most part we're talking extremely clean keto/carnivore.\n\nWe're also mostly OMAD, with lunch being the only meal we typically eat.\n\nWe didn't have any particular philosophical reason for doing this, but rather simply observed what food actually did to us.  Ultra-processed foods made us feel terrible, do we killed those.  Processed carbs act almost like a drug on us, leading to highs/lows/addiction/withdrawal, so we dramatically cut those back to special occasions.  Fewer unprocessed carbs led to more energy and general well-being, so we cut those down to intermittent non-starchy veg and low-carb fruit (berries, mostly).  What's left is keto/carnivore, which just happens to be what makes us feel our best.  Fantastic for all of our medical markers too.  We're in the best shape of our lives having been mostly carnivore for many years now.\n\nThe OMAD bit came about mostly by itself.  Turns out our bodies didn't actually need anywhere near the amount of food we were eating back when we were eating carbs and ultra-processed garbage.  One meal a day is usually plenty of food for us and enough to keep us satisfied all day, but we're not dogmatic about it.  It's pretty much just eat when you're hungry, just like drinking water whenever you're thirsty.  Body wants something, give it something.\n\nI also do week-long water fasts 3-4 times a year, mostly as a mental fitness routine.  I find it beneficial to remind myself periodically that I am theoretically in charge of my body, plus it feels really good to run entirely off of reserves sometimes.\n\nWe also periodically throw all the rules away and spend a week drinking crap, eating ice cream and pastries, and going out for  carby/processed commercial food.  Gotta be bad sometimes and as long as we're good most of the time it's no big deal.

The idea that someone can have the willpower to cook a healthy dinner after a long day of work, potentially dealing with kids, is just not realisitic long-term. Make good choices early in the day while your willpower is high, and allow yourself some grace at nighttime. This is also aided by the fact that I work from home, so I can go to the kitchen and not be locked into whatever I packed for myself.\n\nNormal breakfast -> Banana + protein powder shake\n\nThen I go lift weights, and when I come home I eat -> 2 hard boiled eggs, plain 0% fat greek yogurt with whatever fruit is in season, another protein shake\n\nFor lunch I try to make sure to eat at least 1 big serving of vegetables. Most of the time either carrots, bell pepper, or cucumber with hummus. And then I either make a quesadilla (filled with black beans + bell pepper in addition to cheese) or a sandwich with deli meat, cheese, avocado if I have it, lettuce. Sometimes also tortilla chips and salsa. Or leftovers from a previous dinner. Whatever staple item (sandwich, etc.) you decide to do for most of your lunches, try to make it as healthy as possible. Eating the same thing over and over prevents you from buying 12 different fresh vegetables and then half of them rot before you can eat them all. Just buy/eat the same thing over and over until you're sick of it, then change it up a bit.\n\nDinner is highly variable, but again, I've \"put in the work\" earlier in the day and I feel I have more leeway to be unhealthy or just not think about it too hard. As others have said though, I do very very little stuff like frozen pizza, pre-made dinners, packaged food. Have a list of like 10-14 recipes you can do that are easy like spaghetti with meat sauce, grilled salmon and rice, etc. Or, 3-4 days a week, totally fine to just eat a hamburger with fries or similar \"quick\" food. \n\nNot sure how helpful or instructive any of that is for applying it to your own life. I grew up in a very \"meat and potatoes\" family with tons of butter on everything and not a lot of vegetables that didn't come out of a can.

Thank you in advance for any assistance or guidance you can provide.  First, what I would like to accomplish; second, my current life and financial situation; and third, my questions:\n\n**What I Want to Accomplish**\n\nI want to \"soft retire\" by 55.  I'm currently 40.  Upon retirement, I want to cut my work hours to 20 or so per week, and spend a good deal of time traveling.\n\n**My Current Life & Financial Situation**\n\nI'm married, my wife and I are both 40, and we have no children.  We will not be having children.  We live in Charlotte, NC.  I own a law firm and I teach entrepreneurship at a local university, part-time.  My wife has been unemployed for a bit, but she just graduated with her Masters in Social Work, and she is beginning a part-time job as a mental health counselor in the next month.\n\nFirst, income.  My 2023 employment-based income:\n\n* $100,000 in salary from my law firm\n* $360,000 in distributions from my law firm\n* $5,000 or so from teaching\n\nI expect my income to grow each year, possibly by 10-15% or so, year-over-year.  My field is recession-proof, generally, and we're working on growing the firm by adding more lawyers each year.  We have 6 now (after 2 years of operation) and we'd like to ultimately have 12.  I have one law partner that I split all firm profits with, 50/50.\n\nWhen my wife begins work in the next month (1099 independent contractor), she will make around $20,000 / year.\n\nOther than my job, I own a rental property, but I rent it to friends of mine who are wonderful tenants.  They pay me just a bit more than the $1,700 mortgage each month, although I could get around $2,300 / month if I were to rent it out at market rate to someone else.  They've lived there for 3+ years and I've never had to do anything to maintain or repair the property--they take good care of it and pay rent.  My rental property is a wash and I break about even.\n\nSecond, assets and liabilities.  My current assets and liabilities are:\n\n|Description|Asset Value|Debt|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Primary Residence|$715,000|$315,000 (3.63% APR, 30 year mortgage, with 26 years left)|\n|Rental Property (across the street)|$550,000|$218,000 (3.75% APR, 30 year mortgage, with 22 years left)|\n|2024 BMW|$60,000|$0 (purchased in cash)|\n|Mutual Funds managed by Financial Advisor|$381,000|$0|\n|SoFi Savings Account (4.75% APR)|$83,000|$0 (we were saving money to buy a second home in NYC, but now we're saving to add on to our current home, see below)|\n|IRA (rolled over from 401k with my previous employer)|$97,000|$0|\n|My 401k|$56,000|$0|\n|Wife's 401k|$43,000|$0|\n|Ally Savings Account (4.75% APR, and I'm using this money exclusively to assist my aging parents, who are in ill health)|$62,000|$0|\n|Chase Bank checking and savings|$50,000|$0|\n|Wife's student loan|N/A|$28,000 (unknown interest rate because she graduated recently, but the are federally subsidized loans)|\n|TOTAL|$2,097,000|$561,000|\n\nRe: retirement savings, I started late in life.  Because I don't have much knowledge re: retirement savings, I hired a financial advisor.  The advisor charges 1% of all investments I have with him, each year, as a management fee.  My wife and I are both employed by the firm, and we max out our 401k each year.  I also deposit $10,000 into my brokerage account each month, for investment by my financial advisor.  The money is invested in a mix of funds and has grown very well in the last couple of years.\n\nFinally, we have a couple of expenditures I expect to incur in the next 2 years.  Our home is relatively small and not well suited for 2 people working from home.  Therefore, we intend to undertake a $500,000 renovation in the next year or so.  Other than this, my wife and I moved to Charlotte from New York, so we'd like to spend more time in NYC.  This may mean renting an apartment there in the next 2 years, or so.  We would spend around $4,000/month renting a place (we looked at buying and it was insanely expensive, and more reasonable to rent because we can stop renting at the end of any lease term).  If we rented a place in NYC, we would spend no more than 6 months there, to avoid paying state or city taxes in NY.\n\n**My Questions**\n\nWhen I met with my financial planner initially, they gave me some incredibly high and unobtainable amount of money that I would need to retire (something like $11,000,000).  I don't agree with their number and I'm trying to dial in on what exactly I will need to retire.  My plan is to \"soft retire\" at 55.  That likely means working part-time as a lawyer and teacher.  I would expect to make around $200,000 or so (net, today's dollars) working part-time, upon retirement at 55.  **So my first question:  what amount of money will I need to \"soft retire,\" at 55?**  Let's assume my wife and I, combined, will spend around $150,000 per year upon \"soft retirement.\"  So effectively, we can live off of my income and bank $50,000 or so for further retirement savings, each year, upon soft retirement at 55.\n\nMy rental house is another conundrum for me.  I could sell my rental house upon \"hard retirement\" (when I actually stop working), if that makes financial sense.  It would give me a big influx of cash for retirement, and the property will likely be worth much more in the future (it's in an incredibly desirable part of Charlotte with insane growth around it).  But it could also be a good source of passive income in retirement.  **So my second question:  should I sell my rental house or keep it, and if I should sell it, when?**\n\nAssuming all of the above, **my third question:  at what age could I comfortably \"hard retire\" (meaning, stop working entirely)?**  I'd like to do this around 65, if possible.\n\nFinally, **my last question:  what retirement savings elements am I missing?**  I'm maxing out 401k and putting $10,000/month into brokerage accounts.  Is there anything else I should be doing?\n\nThank you again, in advance, for any assistance or guidance you can provide me!

Thank you in advance for any assistance or guidance you can provide.  First, what I would like to accomplish; second, my current life and financial situation; and third, my questions:\n\n**What I Want to Accomplish**\n\nI want to \"soft retire\" by 55.  I'm currently 40.  Upon retirement, I want to cut my work hours to 20 or so per week, and spend a good deal of time traveling.\n\n**My Current Life & Financial Situation**\n\nI'm married, my wife and I are both 40, and we have no children.  We will not be having children.  We live in Charlotte, NC.  I own a law firm and I teach entrepreneurship at a local university, part-time.  My wife has been unemployed for a bit, but she just graduated with her Masters in Social Work, and she is beginning a part-time job as a mental health counselor in the next month.\n\nFirst, income.  My 2023 employment-based income:\n\n* $100,000 in salary from my law firm\n* $360,000 in distributions from my law firm\n* $5,000 or so from teaching\n\nI expect my income to grow each year, possibly by 10-15% or so, year-over-year.  My field is recession-proof, generally, and we're working on growing the firm by adding more lawyers each year.  We have 6 now (after 2 years of operation) and we'd like to ultimately have 12.  I have one law partner that I split all firm profits with, 50/50.\n\nWhen my wife begins work in the next month (1099 independent contractor), she will make around $20,000 / year.\n\nOther than my job, I own a rental property, but I rent it to friends of mine who are wonderful tenants.  They pay me just a bit more than the $1,700 mortgage each month, although I could get around $2,300 / month if I were to rent it out at market rate to someone else.  They've lived there for 3+ years and I've never had to do anything to maintain or repair the property--they take good care of it and pay rent.  My rental property is a wash and I break about even.\n\nSecond, assets and liabilities.  My current assets and liabilities are:\n\n|Description|Asset Value|Debt|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Primary Residence|$715,000|$315,000 (3.63% APR, 30 year mortgage, with 26 years left)|\n|Rental Property (across the street)|$550,000|$218,000 (3.75% APR, 30 year mortgage, with 22 years left)|\n|2024 BMW|$60,000|$0 (purchased in cash)|\n|Mutual Funds managed by Financial Advisor|$381,000|$0|\n|SoFi Savings Account (4.75% APR)|$83,000|$0 (we were saving money to buy a second home in NYC, but now we're saving to add on to our current home, see below)|\n|IRA (rolled over from 401k with my previous employer)|$97,000|$0|\n|My 401k|$56,000|$0|\n|Wife's 401k|$43,000|$0|\n|Ally Savings Account (4.75% APR, and I'm using this money exclusively to assist my aging parents, who are in ill health)|$62,000|$0|\n|Chase Bank checking and savings|$50,000|$0|\n|Wife's student loan|N/A|$28,000 (unknown interest rate because she graduated recently, but the are federally subsidized loans)|\n|TOTAL|$2,097,000|$561,000|\n\nRe: retirement savings, I started late in life.  Because I don't have much knowledge re: retirement savings, I hired a financial advisor.  The advisor charges 1% of all investments I have with him, each year, as a management fee.  My wife and I are both employed by the firm, and we max out our 401k each year.  I also deposit $10,000 into my brokerage account each month, for investment by my financial advisor.  The money is invested in a mix of funds and has grown very well in the last couple of years.\n\nFinally, we have a couple of expenditures I expect to incur in the next 2 years.  Our home is relatively small and not well suited for 2 people working from home.  Therefore, we intend to undertake a $500,000 renovation in the next year or so.  Other than this, my wife and I moved to Charlotte from New York, so we'd like to spend more time in NYC.  This may mean renting an apartment there in the next 2 years, or so.  We would spend around $4,000/month renting a place (we looked at buying and it was insanely expensive, and more reasonable to rent because we can stop renting at the end of any lease term).  If we rented a place in NYC, we would spend no more than 6 months there, to avoid paying state or city taxes in NY.\n\n**My Questions**\n\nWhen I met with my financial planner initially, they gave me some incredibly high and unobtainable amount of money that I would need to retire (something like $11,000,000).  I don't agree with their number and I'm trying to dial in on what exactly I will need to retire.  My plan is to \"soft retire\" at 55.  That likely means working part-time as a lawyer and teacher.  I would expect to make around $200,000 or so (net, today's dollars) working part-time, upon retirement at 55.  **So my first question:  what amount of money will I need to \"soft retire,\" at 55?**  Let's assume my wife and I, combined, will spend around $150,000 per year upon \"soft retirement.\"  So effectively, we can live off of my income and bank $50,000 or so for further retirement savings, each year, upon soft retirement at 55.\n\nMy rental house is another conundrum for me.  I could sell my rental house upon \"hard retirement\" (when I actually stop working), if that makes financial sense.  It would give me a big influx of cash for retirement, and the property will likely be worth much more in the future (it's in an incredibly desirable part of Charlotte with insane growth around it).  But it could also be a good source of passive income in retirement.  **So my second question:  should I sell my rental house or keep it, and if I should sell it, when?**\n\nAssuming all of the above, **my third question:  at what age could I comfortably \"hard retire\" (meaning, stop working entirely)?**  I'd like to do this around 65, if possible.\n\nFinally, **my last question:  what retirement savings elements am I missing?**  I'm maxing out 401k and putting $10,000/month into brokerage accounts.

Then do the math to determine how many years it will take to get to your numbers.\n\nYou\u2019re making $450k a year.  If you had my withdrawal rate, you should be DONE DONE DONE in 4-8 years, depending on current expenses.\n\nSo go do some math.  $150k/.04 gives $3.75 million.  If you can bank $300k/year, you\u2019re done after 9-11 years, starting from 0.  If you can save more, or you count current invested assets, it will be less.", "reply_created_utc": 1714408719.0}, {"index": "red1_s16_c5_", "comment_text": "Hi there wonderful Reddit strangers.

First, what I would like to accomplish; second, my current life and financial situation; and third, my questions:\n\n**What I Want to Accomplish**\n\nI want to \"soft retire\" by 55.  I'm currently 40.  Upon retirement, I want to cut my work hours to 20 or so per week, and spend a good deal of time traveling.\n\n**My Current Life & Financial Situation**\n\nI'm married, my wife and I are both 40, and we have no children.  We will not be having children.  We live in Charlotte, NC.  I own a law firm and I teach entrepreneurship at a local university, part-time.  My wife has been unemployed for a bit, but she just graduated with her Masters in Social Work, and she is beginning a part-time job as a mental health counselor in the next month.\n\nFirst, income.  My 2023 employment-based income:\n\n* $100,000 in salary from my law firm\n* $360,000 in distributions from my law firm\n* $5,000 or so from teaching\n\nI expect my income to grow each year, possibly by 10-15% or so, year-over-year.  My field is recession-proof, generally, and we're working on growing the firm by adding more lawyers each year.  We have 6 now (after 2 years of operation) and we'd like to ultimately have 12.  I have one law partner that I split all firm profits with, 50/50.\n\nWhen my wife begins work in the next month (1099 independent contractor), she will make around $20,000 / year.\n\nOther than my job, I own a rental property, but I rent it to friends of mine who are wonderful tenants.  They pay me just a bit more than the $1,700 mortgage each month, although I could get around $2,300 / month if I were to rent it out at market rate to someone else.  They've lived there for 3+ years and I've never had to do anything to maintain or repair the property--they take good care of it and pay rent.  My rental property is a wash and I break about even.\n\nSecond, assets and liabilities.  My current assets and liabilities are:\n\n|Description|Asset Value|Debt|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Primary Residence|$715,000|$315,000 (3.63% APR, 30 year mortgage, with 26 years left)|\n|Rental Property (across the street)|$550,000|$218,000 (3.75% APR, 30 year mortgage, with 22 years left)|\n|2024 BMW|$60,000|$0 (purchased in cash)|\n|Mutual Funds managed by Financial Advisor|$381,000|$0|\n|SoFi Savings Account (4.75% APR)|$83,000|$0 (we were saving money to buy a second home in NYC, but now we're saving to add on to our current home, see below)|\n|IRA (rolled over from 401k with my previous employer)|$97,000|$0|\n|My 401k|$56,000|$0|\n|Wife's 401k|$43,000|$0|\n|Ally Savings Account (4.75% APR, and I'm using this money exclusively to assist my aging parents, who are in ill health)|$62,000|$0|\n|Chase Bank checking and savings|$50,000|$0|\n|Wife's student loan|N/A|$28,000 (unknown interest rate because she graduated recently, but the are federally subsidized loans)|\n|TOTAL|$2,097,000|$561,000|\n\nRe: retirement savings, I started late in life.  Because I don't have much knowledge re: retirement savings, I hired a financial advisor.  The advisor charges 1% of all investments I have with him, each year, as a management fee.  My wife and I are both employed by the firm, and we max out our 401k each year.  I also deposit $10,000 into my brokerage account each month, for investment by my financial advisor.  The money is invested in a mix of funds and has grown very well in the last couple of years.\n\nFinally, we have a couple of expenditures I expect to incur in the next 2 years.  Our home is relatively small and not well suited for 2 people working from home.  Therefore, we intend to undertake a $500,000 renovation in the next year or so.  Other than this, my wife and I moved to Charlotte from New York, so we'd like to spend more time in NYC.  This may mean renting an apartment there in the next 2 years, or so.  We would spend around $4,000/month renting a place (we looked at buying and it was insanely expensive, and more reasonable to rent because we can stop renting at the end of any lease term).  If we rented a place in NYC, we would spend no more than 6 months there, to avoid paying state or city taxes in NY.\n\n**My Questions**\n\nWhen I met with my financial planner initially, they gave me some incredibly high and unobtainable amount of money that I would need to retire (something like $11,000,000).  I don't agree with their number and I'm trying to dial in on what exactly I will need to retire.  My plan is to \"soft retire\" at 55.  That likely means working part-time as a lawyer and teacher.  I would expect to make around $200,000 or so (net, today's dollars) working part-time, upon retirement at 55.  **So my first question:  what amount of money will I need to \"soft retire,\" at 55?**  Let's assume my wife and I, combined, will spend around $150,000 per year upon \"soft retirement.\"  So effectively, we can live off of my income and bank $50,000 or so for further retirement savings, each year, upon soft retirement at 55.\n\nMy rental house is another conundrum for me.  I could sell my rental house upon \"hard retirement\" (when I actually stop working), if that makes financial sense.  It would give me a big influx of cash for retirement, and the property will likely be worth much more in the future (it's in an incredibly desirable part of Charlotte with insane growth around it).  But it could also be a good source of passive income in retirement.  **So my second question:  should I sell my rental house or keep it, and if I should sell it, when?**\n\nAssuming all of the above, **my third question:  at what age could I comfortably \"hard retire\" (meaning, stop working entirely)?**  I'd like to do this around 65, if possible.\n\nFinally, **my last question:  what retirement savings elements am I missing?**  I'm maxing out 401k and putting $10,000/month into brokerage accounts.

If you can get a house you like, in a place you want to live for at least 5-6 years and the cost of interest, taxes and maintenance with a normal downpayment is roughly equal to or only a little bit more than you pay for rent is \"as soon as you can\"\n\nMy guess, though, based on your income and savings rate so far, is that you are currently renting for a LOT less than the carrying cost of a 200k house at today's interest rates.  If you figure ~5k.year for property taxes and maintenance, and 7% interest on 160k, that's a little over 16000, which is about 70% of your current total spending.\n\nSo no way are you going to keep the same savings rate, even counting principal payments on the mortgage as part of your savings!\n\nso that would suggest that any attempt to buy a home will be a big rise in your expenses, and put you on a much different track.   It's probably possible if you don't mind lowering your savings rate by quite a bit. \n\nI think the real question is how committed you are to a very early retirement vs. a normal or modestly early one?\n\nIf the answer is not very, then you can probably manage the home now by pulling from Roth contributions for a 5% downpayment, paying PMI until you can get it down to 80% LTV in a few years.  But depending on the details of what you're paying in rent now and what exactly property taxes and maintenance on this property would be, that probably puts you into the realm of a 10-20% savings rate, maybe worse, maybe a little better.     You've got a fine headstart, and much of the house expense (the interest and principal paydowns) aren't going to rise with inflation, so a somewhat early retirement is not out of the questions, but any dreams of retiring at 40-45 are probably dead unless you increase your income substantially.\n\nIf you're hell bent to retire very early, the answer is probably not to buy a home at all unless your income increases a fair bit, or home prices come down relative to rents.\n\nOr maybe I'm wrong, maybe you're paying almost 1500/month in rent and somehow living on 25k/year anyway, in which case, a 200k house that you like is a great idea and you should do it now.   Either pull from your roth and HYSA for a 40k downpayment, or just get a low down payment loan (that will let you pull PMI off when LTV increases enough and pay down principal aggressively until that happens).   TBH, at today's interest rates, it wouldn't hurt to pay down principal aggressively full stop.  At least until you can refinance at a lower rate.\n\nbut you say bills would go up substantially if you bought -- so the real answer here is:  **you need to quantify that**.  By how much?  Exactly, well not exactly but you can't predict it that well, but mean with a *real* estimated amount of that cost.  Price out the mortgage, find out what taxes cost on a house you like in that price range in your area, and add on about 1% of purchase price for annual maintenance costs -- then compare that to your rent.", "reply_created_utc": 1714316888.0}, {"index": "red1_s18_c13_", "comment_text": "So I'm going to be turning 30 soon, single (unable to have kids). \n\nI'm looking at my finances knowing that I want to end up with the white picket fence life one day.

I have a few concerns as to how to go about this and would greatly appreciate advice on where to start. I would like to mention that I am trying to pursue this route as, while my parents seem to have the best intentions for me, I feel more stressed than confident in my ability to achieve my goals from the ways they use to encourage me. I do still have my university\u2019s resources, and I plan on reaching out there as well. As it is finals week though it has been a bit difficult to do so right away. Admittedly, there is not a lot I know about these things as my father is usually the one handling them, but I will be sure to do my research.\n\nSome info on my current situation:\n-  I believe my bank account is shared with my parents. It is a Chase college account, with which I honestly am not sure exactly how it works. I believe it is a checking account. I don\u2019t know how much money there is truly mine, if any, as my father would usually add money during times of credit card payments, or take money to pay for car payments.\n\n-  I have an Apple Card that is obviously linked to my Apple ID, which is of course tied to our family. I know I need to look into this more to figure out how or even if I should go about separating my ID to keep this card. \n\n-  I am a co-signer on one car with my mother as the primary, and I am not sure if I am truly the primary or a co-signer on another car with my sister. My father usually handles the payments associated with both of these cars. I am not sure how to go about this with leaving the house.\n\n-  My father currently has possession of my SS card, birth certificate, and passport. He did pay for these things so technically they are his. I just don\u2019t know how to go about getting them for myself later on. My license expires in July, and right now I\u2019m not sure if I will be able to get it renewed on my own. \n\n-  I have a few job offers lined up with $20/hr pay at least. Based on taxes in Michigan, this seems to be a net of $2.6k/month with full time pay (please correct me if I am wrong). Right now, I am not sure how to go about even getting these jobs and having the pay remain in my account, without my parents questioning where the money is going.\n\n-  I have no student loans thankfully as I am on scholarship\n\nPlease let me know if any more info is needed. I know I am likely sounding very naive about these things, but that is why I am here - to get answers. Please let me know if this is not the right place.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t believe I have a good relationship with my parents, and likely won\u2019t for the next few months at the least. There have been things going on at home for a while now limiting my abilities in my classes. Today I have been slapped across the face and cannot currently hear anything from my left ear. My father also threw a book at my mother\u2019s face and pushed her. I need help. I don\u2019t think I will be able to get my papers. I have emailed my university that I need help.

I owe $108k on it and should have that amount from cashflow by the time I retire. I also have $330k in taxable investments (all VTSAX, mostly long-term) and $83k in I bonds (already bought max for 2024). Backdoor Roth IRA, 401k, and HSA are all maxed or on autopilot to be maxed by EOY.\n\nI'm debating what to between now and then with new money.  If I aim to maintain an 80/20 portfolio regardless, am I better off just putting the money in VTSAX all year and selling what I need to pay the mortgage right before I retire or buying T-Bills all year and just making sure they mature in time?\n\nAgain, I'm going to be 80/20 regardless so I'm going to have the same amount in \"bonds\" anyway, just a matter of if it's in my 401k for the next year or just in Treasury Direct (and if some of my US stock investment is in my taxable brokerage or 401k/RIRA).  \n\nI'm leaning towards T-Bills right now (and have already bought some) but the higher taxes are making me question it.  I'm in the 24% federal tax bracket (15% LTCG) and 5.99% state, although next year I'd expect that all to be much lower, I'll probably make under $50k.", "reply_created_utc": 1714240652.0}, {"index": "red1_s19_c15_", "comment_text": "Please use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new post to the sub.
