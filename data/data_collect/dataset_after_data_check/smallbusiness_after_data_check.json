Week of December 9, 2019 \n/r/smallbusiness is one of a very few subs where people can ask questions about operating their small business. To let that happen the main sub is dedicated to answering questions about subscriber's own small businesses.\n\nMany people also want to talk about things which are not specific questions about their own business. We don't want to disappoint those subscribers and provide this post as a place to share that content without overwhelming specific and often less popular simple questions.\n\nThis isn't a license to spam the thread. Business promotion and free giveaways are welcome only in the Promote Your Business thread. Thinly-veiled website or video promoting posts will be removed as blogspam.\n\nDiscussion of this policy and the purpose of the sub is welcome at https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/ana6hg/psa_welcome_to_rsmallbusiness_we_are_dedicated_to/", "comment_created_utc": 1714357544.0, "reply_text": "Lesson learnt.

Took a job in small business lending back home in BC while I figured out the next move.  \n  \nAfter 3 years I started a small business, just like you working my side-hustle on weekends and evenings around my corporate job. Eventually I took the leap and left my 9-5. \n  \nThe first 1-2 years I couldn't get enough of it, I loved every second I was working because the business was growing and doing fantastic. I've just started my 4th year and now starting to want some of my free time back, so I'm hiring more people and training them to help me. I've aged 10 years in the last 4, but I also earn double what I earned working in local banking (about on par with what I earned banking in London, but without the cost of living in London).  \n\nI don't know if there's any advice in there but I imagine the pattern will be similar - work hard, grow, work harder, grow, burn out a little and start taking back your time a little. Aside from wanting a bit of my life back I also think it would be better for the business if I had time to look at big picture things rather than focusing on the day to day.  \n  \nThe reformed banker in me also thinks its really important to understand the cashflow cycle of your business - how long it takes to go from spending money, to getting it back again (ie: buying inventory, selling inventory, and getting paid). A lot of businesses over-commit, spend too much and don't have the resources to cover the gap until they get paid. Growing quickly is one of the most expensive things you can do, even if it is ultimately what you want. Just don't outgrow your cashflow.\n  \nI don't know if that's helpful but good for you, I hope it continues going well for you.", "reply_created_utc": 1714453973.0}, {"index": "red3_s4_c3_", "comment_text": "I am quitting a $150k per year job to go out on my own and help my wife run our small business. 2 years ago this July we purchased a small industrial/commercial pump distributorship in South East Pennsylvania.

The IRS requires S corp owner/employees to take a reasonable salary, unless they take no money at all out of their company.  The tax savings come in if the company makes more than your salary.  At that point, after you pay yourself a salary and the related payroll taxes, you can take money out of the company as distributions.  Distributions are not subject to payroll taxes or self-employment tax.\n\nThere is no exact formula for a reasonable salary.  Rather, the facts and circumstances have to be considered.  A good (although not foolproof) method is to pay yourself at least what you would pay an employee to do the work.\n\nIn the meantime, I suggest you go back to your accountant and get some clarification.

They \"look into it\" two weeks go by and I finally get frustrated, call in a demand to speak to a manager and get thus resolved so I can take payments and not frickin venmos, after an hour they  realize the guy who created my account mis entered on the digits on my EIN and I basically had to go back in a set up everything again from scratch. A plethora of misinformation about interest rates, balance transfers, and promotional deals I told I was getting, and every single person told me conflicting things. Then I did a balance transfer because i was specifically told it was 0% interest. I had to make a call at the bank to do it where I was then told it was 21% interest. I immediately canceled the next morning at 9. They told me the cancel was successful and it would not go through. Then, a week or so later, I see the amount of the balance transfer on my credit card. I call in to see why it's on there. Several calls were made, and they told me it was cancelled and that it would fall off the balance. A week or so later, it's still there so I call in for like the 50th time for various issues. The lady on the phone admitted to me that whoever canceled it made a mistake and didn't do it properly, so it went through. I told her about how I was told it was 0% interest and that the reason I cancelled it was the hugh interest rate. She Saud they would call me and let me know if they could change the interest rate to 0. Two weeks go buy, and I finally hear from dispute resolution. They said, \"we have investigated this incident and found that we were not in error, so the interest rate would not change.\" I was furious. The lady literally told me they made a mistake.
