But unfortunately, went to an Eataly and ordered a couple pasta dishes, am now convinced al dente is supposed to have a raw ring in it even after tossing with sauce.\n\nWe sent it back (first time in my life) and the second time it still had the raw ring, but it was slightly smaller... tables around us were also sending back pasta for being undercooked. The server just said stuff like \"I'm sorry it's not to your liking, our pasta is very al dente\"\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=al+dente+white+ring\n\n> You can see there is a white ring surrounding the still dry pasta in the center. The pasta in the middle is cooked al dente, which is what we are looking for. The center has a solid white dot, indicating that it still has a bit of a bite\n\n>  If you pull a piece pasta from your pot, bite into it. There should be a chalky, gritty quality to the middle of the pasta, and you\u2019ll be able to see it. If you look at the cross section of the noodle (where you bit), you should be able to see a thin white ring in the middle. That\u2019s the stuff we like to see\n\n> With some pasta types like Penne etc. you can sometimes actually see the uncooked inner layer (a thin white line) if you carefully slice it in half which a knife, or just bite cleanly with your teeth\n\nIdk, I get the concept, just can't believe this restaurant consistently serves undercooked pasta on accident (https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-pizza-and-la-pasta-at-eataly-los-angeles-los-angeles?osq=Pasta+and+Pizza&q=undercooked). Other than the undercooked pasta the execution seemed great.\n\nEdit: lol had to update cuz I saw this review:\n\n> A word of caution though: PLEASE understand what al dente means before you order the pasta. The parties next to us were all complaining about the pasta being too undercooked. Before you order just please know al dente refers to the pasta still having a bit of crunch to it as it is quickly cooked per the Italian way. If you prefer your pasta with less crunch and more silky smoothness, simply ask for it."}, {"comment_author": "SilverEyedFreak", "comment_text": "Accidentally made Al-dente buttered/parsley pasta for my kids but it was alright but not their favorite.

I enjoy chefs sharing info and things that aren\u2019t necessarily relevant to me at home out of curiosity/interest, but then people take it all so literally and seriously without thinking about how cooking for yourself at home differs from a restaurant\u2026\n\nAs an aside I feel like another great example of this is the online cooking forum obsession with wok hei in Chinese cooking. It\u2019s mostly a thing for a very specific style of restaurant dishes and, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s delicious and would be required to exactly recreate those dishes of course. But your average mom making home cooked food in China is not blasting a jet burner every night in their kitchen.

Home cooks don't need to worry about presentation, speed, big batches, consistency across multiple locations, etc.   \nSame goes for knife skills, don't need to be blindingly fast, just be safe.  \n  \nAs for sauce, I've tried both ways, mixing into sauce in a pan, and just pouring some sauce on when already plated. Honestly, no real difference to me.  And its handier for leftovers to have extra plain pasta, than the whole batch stuck with that sauce. Also lets people use as much sauce as they want. (Personally, I want pasta with a bit of sauce.... not soup)"}, {"comment_author": "wildgoldchai", "comment_text": "I feel this applies to eggs, especially scrambled eggs. At least with boiled/poached eggs you can stop the cooking process instantly by dropping the eggs in cold water. With scrambled, it\u2019ll cook for a bit longer in its residual heat.

For example, its impossible to know if your \"heavenly\" is more or less cooked than an Italian pasta master's idea of perfect al dente. And I'm sure every Italian pasta master has a slightly different ideal of al dente.\n\nI really thought a perfect al dente was essentially right as that raw ring disappeared in the end product-- basically, just cooked, but nothing more. But Eataly is pretty legit, and they had a VERY noticeable white ring in their final rigatoni dish, even after sending it back. Definitely an outlier in my experiences but I guess I'll just have to eat more Italian pasta."}, {"comment_author": "warmleafjuice", "comment_text": "If you're not stir frying on a re-purposed F13 afterburner, why bother?"}, {"comment_author": "bigelcid", "comment_text": ">I want pasta with a bit of sauce.... not soup\n\nWell, it wouldn't be soup if you did the *mantecatura* right.

The general idea is always \"just don't overcook the pasta\".  \n\nHowever, none of them told me they wanted a chalky inside *while eating*. And it stands to reason, I think. It makes sense that the pasta is best eaten the moment the chalky interior gets cooked.  \n\nAs legit as Eataly may or may not be, I wouldn't put it past people to completely misinterpret the idea of al dente, with a lot of nuance lost in translation from top to bottom."}, {"comment_author": "BellaBlue06", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t like really overcooked or mushy pasta.

The macaroni should not be al dente, but not overcooked either; there's a toothsome texture to be found between those two extremes.

If it's still not crispy you can go longer.\n\nEdit: before air frying, it helps to break the tofu into bite size pieces with your hands, as opposed to cutting it in cubes. The rough surface makes it get crispier. Once broken up, add a bit of oil and gently toss to coat. Then add whatever seasonings you like and toss to coat. Then the last step is to add corn starch or potato starch, and gently toss to coat. The starch will stick to the oil. Then when you air fry, gently toss every 7 mins or so.

There are so, so many vegetarian Indian dishes, the cuisine will turn into a treasure trove for your family to explore. Recipes that are labeled as \"___ Paneer\" generally are vegetarian and use a sort of Indian cheese as the 'protein'. It's easy enough to substitute, you can use Feta, cojita, firm tofu, even mozzarella, but it's also very easy to make at home. And, if you end up getting sick of rice like you did pasta, you can always substitute it with something else. Curry just means sauce, so you can eat it with naan, other vegetables, samosas, or even turn it into a soup.\n\nSalads. They are incredibly diverse and can allow every member of the family to customize theirs to taste. It can even let you sneak some meat onto the table, since your GF doesn't have to add any to hers. One of my favorites is made of spinach, candied pumpkin seeds (pepitas), roasted pumpkin or butternut squash, goat cheese, pomegranate seeds, chicken, and an apple cider and maple dressing.

Could easily pre make black bean patties or sub meat based on your time constraints. \n\nSecond, stir fry. We do tofu that has been frozen and then patted dry rather than pressed fresh to save time. Can literally mix any veggie and rice or cauliflower rice that you have. Could also easily sub meat for tofu for the meat eaters\n\nWe also make a tofu version of popular egg roll in a bowl recipes where you could make the pork as described and then sub stir fried tofu (we make it spicy) over cabbage etc seasoned with soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and sesame oil. \n\nAs many others have said, rice and beans can turn into a burrito bowl for meat eaters and when seasoned are delicious for those who don\u2019t eat meat. \n\nTexture wise meat dumplings can be tolerable to some meat-avoidant folk but are also available vegetarian or seafood based. Make frozen dumpling of choice into dumpling soup or dumplings and fried rice. \n\nDon\u2019t know if they dislike taste of fish but a ratio of canned chunk light tuna in water mixed with stovetop stuffing mix makes some great almost crab cakes when you get the consistency (mix of tuna, tuna juice, and stuffing mix) right.  Serve with salad. \n\nBaked potatoes (which we microwave instead) topped with cottage cheese and dill or with chili are delicious. \n\nAs others have mentioned make a batch of chili with meat and without meat (just bean) chili\n\nDoes she like eggs? This opens up the whole realm of ramen/bibimbap with meat added for meat eaters. Our favorite breakfast ever is Costa Rican gallo pinto and eggs. \n\nAlso, fish tacos with frozen fried fish filets and slaw (broccoli or cabbage based mixed with Mayo and lime juice) with hot sauce as desired and bell pepper/mushroom/onion/garlic/seasoning as a side. \n\nAlso, there are pho/ramen instant bowls and recipes that are easy to doctor up as you wish with veggies or protein. As others have said if they tolerate meat broth can make a large vat of soup or pot pie and sub bean (white bean for chicken, black for beef, and pinto for pork, or whatever they like) for the meat for her portion which would be removed after seasonings blended but before meat added for simplicity.\n\nMy current obsession is a quesadilla or breakfast burrito of egg, cheese, and hot sauce dipped in Trader Joe\u2019s Guacasalsa. \n\nWhatever your locally cheapest tortilla chips with all the toppings can be an easy sheet pan with meat on the side for meat eaters."}, {"comment_author": "Ok-Mammoth9846", "comment_text": "Oh and homemade/store bought pizza dough when divided can make a bunch of different flavors.

Here:  \n  \nA square meal has fiber, protein, carbohydrate, and fat. The most satisfying (i.e. *filling*) carbohydrates are the complex ones: either grains (such as wheat or rye) or tubers (such as potatoes or turnips). You're bored with your usual carb choice, which is the most common grain - wheat - squished into dense little shapes. You could eat something else made of wheat, like bread. But you don't even have to stick with wheat. The standard American diet has *four* major complex carbs that people usually use as the foundational complex carb in meals:   \n  \n* Wheat  \n* Rice  \n* Potatoes  \n* Corn  \n  \nThink of a few things you can make with each of those, and build meals around them. Wheat is made into breads, pastries, and pastas. How about baking Italian or French breads, or buying fresh ones? What about breads from other parts of the world? Pitas? Naan? Papadam? Muffins? Or different kinds of pastas, like couscous? What about dumplings? Pastries like spanakopita? Savoury vegetarian pies?\n\nBut wheat is just one kind of grass seed. We eat so much of it that we had to pass laws saying it had to be fortified because we were getting diseases of malnutrition. The human body needs more diversity; it's a good idea to branch out.\n   \nSo you can switch to one of the other major carbs. You could base a meal on potatoes, rice, or corn. How about vegetarian versions of scalloped potatoes? Stir-fried rice? Corn bread? Stew? Chili? Shepherd's pie? Tacos or burritos made with corn or wheat wraps, and/or with corn in them? \n  \nThen you can consider branching out even further and making meals based on other complex carbs, like:  \n  \n* quinoa  \n* barley  \n* oats  \n* rutabagas  \n* turnips  \n* parsnips and carrots\n* sweet potato  \n* wild rice  \n* amaranth\n* taro root  \n  \nAnd you can even start serving the grains & tubers as sides, and founding your meals on pulses instead:   \n  \n* beans   \n* chickpeas   \n* split peas    \n* lentils   \n   \nThat gives you more fiber and protein, which is *great* for your health. This is what most vegetarians do, to boost their protein intake. Consider:   \n  \n * minestrone with garlic bread  \n * chili (with beans) with dinner buns  \n * ham & spilt pea soup with toasted sourdough  \n * chana masala with naan\n * hummus and pita bread  \n * hoppin' john with rice  \n * Jamaican rice & beans    \n  \nOr other protein sources like cheese or tofu:  \n  \n * Indian dishes based on paneer, like palak paneer   \n * I'm not even going to bother listing tofu dishes; you know how to google :)"}, {"comment_author": "cwsjr2323", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t see a problem, separate plates are easy.  \n\nI don\u2019t eat pork or seafood.

I like avocado on mine. \n\nMany go vegetarian and eat things that say 'vegetarian.' I've abstained from meat several times in my life, once with a partner and her children. In our discussions on it, we tripped pout over the fact that most meals we craved shared the fact that we were craving everything but meat. Or it wasn't missed to the point of ruining the dish. Nachos are a great example of this.\n\nWhere beans are present, sub those for meat. If you're comfortable with frozen foods from the grocery \"grounds\" and similar substitutes/alternatives have come a LONG way. I personally recommend waiting a few months before trying those opposed to transitioning directly from meat to alternatives. Besides a lot of them aren't that healthy. They can be nice when you're suddenly craving a burger and have reasons not to partake.\n\nI'd also say feel free to add proteins you enjoy to things and don't feel constrained by conventional approaches. You'll figure out bomb pairings, and in my opinion and many vegetarians I know: you might find certain things taste better without meat altogether.\n\nA great example of this: I made pizza for a living for about ten years. Woodfire, new York style, a brief stint at a Casey's etc. My last gf ate a vegan diet, and long story short I was super averse to cheeseless pizza. It's become one of my favorite ways to enjoy certain flavors, can feel better to eat (it's less heavy) and I'm trying things out that I wouldn't otherwise. I also came to learn that traditional a'pizza introduced to this country in the first place uses sprinklings of parmesan, which is much closer to what we would consider \"cheeseless\" than what we're used to.\n\n\nTldr: this doesn't have to suck and you're not stuck with anything.

There are so many tricks to make food less ... basic? That's the best analogy I can think of. Plant-based food can also be cheap as fuck.\n\nAs other folks have mentioned, Indian food is a good option. You can feed an army with a batch of chana masala and rice \u2013 or naan if you're feeling ambitious. A couple cans of chickpeas, a couple cans of tomatoes, aromatics, and toasted spices, DINNER TIME.\n\nAs a caveat, Indian food can be labour-intensive, but it yields a lot of food when paired with starches. If you make enough you'll also have leftovers for days. Just make sure to add some variety to your recipes.\n\nWhen I'd make meals for touring bands, chili was always a big hit. Dead simple, cheap, and it can be kinda whatever you want it to be. Again, pair that with some starches and you've got a full meal.\n\nThrowing a bunch of root veggies on a roasting pan and forgetting about them (not until they burn, until they're roasted) in the oven is also easy. Think carrots, onions, potatoes, beets, etc. Just treat them real nice with some oil and seasoning and they don't even have to be a side dish.\n\nThese are my thoughts, thanks for reading my bullshit.\n\nAddendum: I could eat pasta every fucking day.

To cook the lentils in a pressure cooker, place the lentils the cooker along with 2 cups of water and salt. Cover the cooker, place the weight on and cook until you hear one whistle. After the first whistle, turn the heat to low and allow the lentils to simmer for about 3 minutes and turn off the heat.\n\nAllow the pressure to release naturally. Once the pressure is released, open the cooker and keep the lentils aside.\n\nThe next step is to stew the tomatoes, roughly chop them and keep aside. Click here to see how to stew the tomatoes. The link shows you how to puree tomatoes, but for this recipe, chopped tomatoes work well.\n\nGet the vegetable stock ready too. If you don't find the time to make vegetable stock, then you can use water and adjust the spices in the Tagine to bring out the flavors.\n\nNext step is to make the Pumpkin Tagine. Heat oil in a heavy bottomed pan or a Tagine. Add in the onions and garlic and saute until the onions are soft and tender.\n\nOnce the onions are soft, add in the turmeric powder, cumin powder, sambal oelek, paprika or chilli powder, sugar, salt and the tomatoes and pumpkin. Saute until the vegetables get partially cooked.\n\nNext add in the cooked lentils, stir it into the pumpkin tagine and check the salt and spice levels. Adjust to suit your taste.

They named their invention 'Jell-O'.  Two years later, the couple sold the idea to Francis Woodward, owner of the Genessee Pure Food Company, that also sold a health drink called 'Grain-O'.  \n\nJello-O was not an instant success, however, so Woodward began running ads in women's magazines that advertised the product as 'America's Most Famous Dessert'.  To push things along, he also began sending salesmen into the field, giving away gelatin cookbooks with every Jell-O purchase.  \n\nBy WWI, gelatin desserts had become popular and affordable to just about everyone, and sales increased throughout the '20s.  Then the Depression hit in late 1929.  But just as things were looking bleak, a new craze developed for 'aspic salads'; by creating a new flavor, lime, that mixed better with chopped vegetables (later there would also be celery, tomato, and other savory flavors) Jell-O managed to stay afloat.  Then, in 1934, they began sponsoring popular comedian Jack Benny's radio show, allowing their new jingle to be heard over the air, coast to coast.\n\nAnd that's only the first 30-something years of the 'Jell-O story'.

Simmer until chicken is fully cooked. Transfer chicken to a stand mixer (or use a hand mixer) and shred with the paddle attachment. While the chicken is shredding, add egg noodles to pot.
