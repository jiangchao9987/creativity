Seriously though- the only potato dough recipe I have tried is Italian gnocchi, I made it several times and one of those times it came out amazing.  The trick is not to overwork the potato, because it gets gummy which makes it feel heavy.  The recipes always say to gradually add flour to get the hydration right, but I think it's the opposite- you have to get pretty close to all the flour in right away, because the potato will keep absorbing it and you end up mixing it 100 times.

I don\u2019t know nor have i ever cared to be any better at cooking than throw a bunch of random stuff in the pot and wait. I don\u2019t even really care if it tastes good as long as it sustains me, def a food is fuel person. But they are very different. They are picky and food shy and hates repeating meals and don't like leftovers and will just refuse to eat if they think they won\u2019t like how it tastes. It's like the antithesis of all my own food ethos and they won't tell me what they want to eat and never have any ideas. Getting enough calories in them is a struggle and they won\u2019t reliably drink Ensures or any other meal replacement drink. How they fed themselves before all this is beyond me (and they're unhelpful when i ask) \n\nI\u2019m need to go shopping for them and i have no idea what to even put on the list. Just completely blank! Can i list they're \u2018no\u2019s and yall give me some suggestions? Please? I could really use the help \n\n- No cheese. except feta, ricotta, and parmesan in moderation \n- No meat at all \n- No tofu or TVP \n- No bean based dishes \n- No spicy (if it\u2019s spicier than basic ass potato salad it\u2019s to spicy) \n- No tomatoes \n- No soups  \n- No \u2018greasy\u2019 (they can\u2019t tell me what greasy is and is very inconsistent about what is and is not greasy.

I\u2019ve tried looking into vegetarian and vegan stuff but it all seems to use tofu or beans. And if it doesn't have that theres tomatoes! I'm lost. Please, i need clear and precise recipes by the boatload \n\nEdit: They like Italian but the tomatoes are an issue and they don't like pesto. Eggs are ok but they're eating a lot of egg forward food right now and I'm afraid they're going to start turning their nose up to it if I don't introduce more variety. Most veggies are acceptable \n\nEdit: They do eat stir fry, but only very sweet sauces. Quinoa is generally a no. Pancakes and cereal usually go ok. Greek yogurt is a no. \n\nI already sneak creams into foods to bump the calories, am willing to try sneaking in proteins and other things. Pureed beans in sauces? Maybe same with chicken? It's light colored so might work in pale sauces \n\nY'all have some great ideas!

I\u2019ve trained in dietetics, and it\u2019s so much more than people realize. \n\nA good dietitian will very much be able to address ARFID and offer recipes. \n\nIn the mean time: \n\n- calorie intake seems to be an issue, so buy full fat everything if it can be tolerated. \n\n- you can add meal replacement powder (like boost or ensure) into other things to \u201cbeef\u201d it up. For example, if cold cereal can be tolerated, add it to the milk. I know you said the shakes themselves aren\u2019t tolerated, but what about mixed into a fruit smoothie? \n\n- what about puddings? Rice pudding? Chocolate pudding? Even just a vanilla pudding. It\u2019s got whole milk and eggs! \n\n- bechamel-adjacent  sauces to put on things to up their calories if tolerated.

It\u2019s a pretty forgiving recipe with so many applications. Some of my go to combos: garlic powder, whole milk and Parmesan to pair with pasta. Grainy mustard, and chicken broth to pair with veg. Onion powder, red wine and beef broth to top mashed (or roasted) potatoes. \n\n- how well are baked goods tolerated? You can add protein powder to muffin, brownie, or cake batters.

Thank you", "reply_text": "Before I can come up with ideas, I have a couple questions:\n\n1)  Are they willing/able to help you cook?  Even if it's only opening cans, or washing veggies, getting involved in the prep can help.\n\n2)  Do they enjoy watching tv?  If so, can you direct them towards a couple of interesting cooking shows?  Nothing too fancy or with wild ingredients (definitely NOT chopped!).  Maybe things like The Kitchen, where it's basically a talk show with several dish preparations thrown in.  The hosts are all friendly, nothing is very complicated and it's relaxing to watch.  And there are tons of seasons!!\n\n3)  Do you feel like it's the repetition of a food item that eventually makes them refuse it?  Or the texture of certain foods?  Or is it the feeling that they aren't in control of the meal?  If it's the control thing, helping to plan the meals and prep them will help.\n\n  \nI deal with some of this with my son.  He's a very good cook, lived independently for over 20 years and is now here living with me due to health issues.  He's on a very strict/special diet and having to give up foods he wants, plus giving up the control of the kitchen made him very irritable and picky about his meals.  We eventually worked it out (mostly), but it still crops up now and then and I realize that it's time to switch things up again.  \n\nHe is on a super low protein diet, as in no red meats, limited white meats and very little seafood.  Believe it or not, you don't need as much protein in your diet as most people believe these days.  His diet calls for 3-4 ounces of protein per day.  Per day!  And his bloodwork shows that his heart, liver and kidneys are loving the reduction in protein... he's healthier now than he was 2 years ago.\n\nWe do like to sneak in extra protein fruit with ice cold, thick smoothies.  No weird stuff in them!  I fill a smoothie cup with 2/3 frozen fruit, 1/4 cup of any juice, a good sized dollop of either honey or cream of coconut and then top off the cup with nonfat greek yogurt (about 3/4 cup).  It's a thick, rich, cold fruity frosty and he loves them!\n\nPancakes are a great source of protein!  Add 2 eggs instead of 1 to a cup of flour.  If they eat half of the resulting pancakes they've gotten an entire egg for breakfast.  \n\nWe make a dish we call \"Veggie Puff\" or \"Strata\" for meatless Monday.  Tear up a dry bread (something with some heft to it, not smushy white bread) in a buttered casserole dish.  Top that layer with any veggies your patient loves.  Top that with another layer of torn up bread.  Mix together 2 cups of half and half with 4 eggs, salt, pepper and any spices or herbs they like best.  Pour the egg mixture over the bread, drizzle it with melted butter and let it sit in the fridge all day.  Bake at 350 for 1 hour and it will puff up and get crispy and golden on the top and bottom... like a really good grilled cheese sammy, but without the cheese.\n\n  \nThat's it for now for me.

Thank you", "reply_text": "Banana muffins may be a breakfast option if plain banana is a no-go.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0No meat, cheese, tofu, tvp, obvious beans, or yogurt... That's BAD.\u00a0Eggs sound like your best protein option. If eggs are no-go, that leaves lentils or chickpeas if they aren't to similar to beans\n\n\nPotatoes are nutrition dense so they might be a good veggie to lean on. I know plain mashed is out, but what about roasted? Baked? Boiled baby potatoes tossed with lemon?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0**Meal ideas:**\u00a0\n\n\n* Creamy barley with peas. Barley is healthy and the cream cheese gets some extra calories into your friend. Cook 100g of barley in 2.5 cups veggie stock (add a third and a time; stir the barley until it absorbs the liquid before adding the next portion), add frozen peas and 50g cream cheese once cooked.\u00a0\n\n\n* [Flatbread with roasted zucchini](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/roasted-zucchini-flatbread-with-hummus-arugula-goat-cheese-and-almonds-recipe-2105983)? It has hummus on it but isn't a bean based dish overall. The goat cheese can be replaced with a little feta which is a safe cheese option for them. And the almonds can be omitted entirely if that's a no.\n\n\n* Pizza! You can buy pizza dough (or make it) to create your own flavour combos. Since tomatoes and pesto are out, you can just drizzle olive oil on the dough then add cracked black pepper, and either finely grated garlic or chopped rosemary. Top with whatever your friend likes, such as red onions or caramelized onions, black olives, spinach, feta, etc.\u00a0\n\n\n* Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe - it's a simple dish which is good for when they don't want to try anything too different. It's a cheese & black pepper sauce (no tomatoes or basil).\n\n\n* Lasagna with bechamel sauce instead of tomato sauce? Since meat is a no, you can add a layer of veggies in instead. Spinach or eggplant both work well in this type of lasagna.\u00a0\n\n\n* [Roasted gnocchi & veggies](https://www.frugalfamilytimes.com/2022/12/oven-baked-gnocchi-with-roasted-vegetables/) is quick and easy to throw together. Just leave out the tomatoes and add something they like such as cauliflower in instead.\u00a0\n\n\n* Sandwiches don't have to be boring! And they don't need meat. Look up Mediterranean vegetable sandwiches for ideas. As an example: a smear of hummus or white bean dip on the bread, sliced cucumber, red onion, bell pepper, mixed greens, and a bit of sliced feta.\n\n\n* Soba noodle salad. Basically, soba noodles tossed with finely chopped raw veggies (carrot, cabbage, bell pepper, etc). Dress with sesame oil, fresh lime, or similar flavours. Since eggs are a safe option, that can be sliced in half/quarters lengthwise and served on top (either a plain boiled egg, slightly soft-boiled for a creamy yolk, or soy marinated depending on this person's preference).\u00a0\n\n\n* Falafel might be an option if you bake it instead of frying it. And since it's mostly chickpeas, it's a protein option that isn't eggs.\u00a0\n\n\n* [Zucchini and lentil fritters](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/zucchini-lentil-fritters-with-lemony-yogurt) maybe?\u00a0It's another protein option. Again, bake instead of frying. Make sure you omit the chili! And instead of the yogurt dip, whip some ricotta with lemon juice and olive oil.\n\n\nNOTE:\u00a0Use leftovers for the sandwiches! If you made too much roasted eggplant for dinner the day before, that's now a sandwich veggie. If you have leftover leafy salad, that's now a sandwich veggie.\n\n\n(Edit: formatting)"}, {"comment_text": "Please help me. I don't know what to do.

But had a major sweet tooth, that was helpful.\n\nI would recommend putting ensure or protein shakes/powder into everything you can, drinking comfort drinks like coffee/mocha/chai tea, or fruit smoothie or even better: milkshakes are a great way to easily get in a lot of extra calories!  Always offer them something yummy to sip on (or a creamy soup even) all of the time.  It also helps with them simply just getting tired by eating too. Also it\u2019s a good way to get in enough liquids too.\n\nThis is a good reason to offer small appetizer-sized food nibbles often, they often don\u2019t notice how much they are eating as they are not overwhelmed by it.  Frozen cream puffs are the way and not too sweet or cold!  Tiny full fat cream custard frittata egg bites/frittatas made in a mini muffin pan.  Chawan mushi is a Japanese steamed savory custard that is simple to make in small cups, with some tiny veggies, maybe some proteins, but is delicate and delicious over a little simple white rice.\n\nKodiak protein pancake mix comes plain or in chocolate flavor, and can be made into muffins too!  I\u2019d make tiny ones, and they are great with butter/syrup, or we like it with a fruity yogurt (substitute cream to amp up calories!).\n\nHummus, especially homemade, or other dips made from beans or nuts (Bitchin\u2019 sauce is made from almonds, so good) are great with cream crackers, small slices of cheese and a bit of sliced fruit or bit of deli meat.  Like a mini version of charcuterie board or a lunchable for an adult!  Grapes, sliced apple/pear, a few nuts or dried fruit like apricots\u2026yum.\n\nTiny cream-based scones/biscuits with butter and jam, tiny chicken salad sandwiches, flavored cream cheese toasts.\n\nPuff pastry anything is delicious\u2026sweetened cream cheese and a few canned cherries or fresh berries can fill them.\n\nSmall dishes of creamy casseroles (slip pur\u00e9ed beans and cream and unflavored protein powder into them, think potatoes and spinach, pasta, ratatouille\u2026\n\nI wish you the best! \ud83e\udd70"}, {"comment_text": "Please help me.

I also included the concerns about protein from one of the comments.\n\nHere\u2019s what it suggested:\n\nQuinoa and Feta Salad: \nQuinoa is a complete protein, providing all nine essential amino acids. Feta adds additional protein and flavor. The inclusion of vegetables like spinach or bell peppers adds vitamins and fiber.\n\nEgg and Vegetable Frittata: \nEggs are a high-quality protein source. Adding vegetables brings in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. The versatility of this dish allows for a variety of nutrients depending on the vegetables used.\n\nParmesan Crusted Zucchini: \nParmesan cheese offers protein and calcium, while zucchini provides dietary fiber and vitamins. This dish is a good way to combine nutrients with satisfying flavors.\n\nRicotta-Stuffed Pasta Rolls: \nRicotta is rich in protein and calcium. Using whole wheat pasta adds fiber, and incorporating spinach or other greens adds iron and vitamins for a more balanced meal.\n\nEgg-Filled Avocado Boats (if reconsidering avocados): \nEggs provide a solid protein source, and avocados are rich in healthy fats, fiber, and various essential nutrients, making this a balanced option.\n\nCauliflower Rice Stir-Fry with Egg: \nEggs add protein, while cauliflower rice is a low-carb, fiber-rich base. Adding a variety of other vegetables increases the meal's vitamin and mineral content.\n\nSpinach and Cheese Stuffed Mushrooms: \nSpinach is a good source of iron and vitamins, mushrooms provide fiber and a meaty texture, and cheese adds protein and calcium to the dish.\n\nCheesy Polenta with Roasted Vegetables: \nPolenta, made from cornmeal, provides carbohydrates for energy. The cheese incorporated into the polenta adds protein and fat for satiety, and roasted vegetables add fiber and nutrients.\n\nEgg Salad with Feta and Herbs: \nEggs are the primary protein source here. Feta adds a tangy flavor and extra protein. Herbs and greens can provide antioxidants and additional nutrients.\n\nRicotta and Herb Stuffed Peppers: \nBell peppers are rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants. Ricotta cheese provides protein and calcium, and herbs enhance the dish's nutrient profile with their health benefits.\n\nEach dish is designed to offer a balance between proteins (from eggs, cheese, and quinoa), healthy fats (from cheeses and potentially avocado), and carbohydrates (from vegetables and whole grains), along with a range of vitamins and minerals from the inclusion of various vegetables and herbs.

I\u2019m just going to add some of my favorite suggestions as an ADHD-snacks are meals person. \n\nSome kind of nuts like lightly salted cashews, shelled pistachios or peanuts can be an \u201cappetizer\u201d. High protein, fat, and overall nutrient dense. Salad with feta, onion, baked pita chips or regular pita bread. Olive oil with some zaatar seasoning and or citrus maybe as dressing. Or Caesar salad. Dressing can be made either as a dairy base or oil base. \n\nHoney or brown sugar glazed salmon if they don\u2019t consider seafood as meat. Costco has one in their freezer section that my fish hating bf even likes. Secretly I make up reasons to take him to Costco sometimes just for him to try the samples. It has worked in favor of my sanity so far and expanded his palate beyond burgers, chicken tenders, and pizza. \n\nPierogi can be delicious filled with just about anything. If the frozen ones are available and edible to your person, go for it. If not, any pasta/dumpling dough recipe with their choice of filling will do fine.

Best i can tell it\u2019s a mouth feel thing) \n- No avocado \n- No oatmeal \n- Nothing fried \n- No mash potatoes \n- Heavy cream and Coconut cream are ok if i don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s in there \n\nI don't have any recipes left in my repertoire at all since they started refusing to eat chicken. I don\u2019t know how to work with these restrictions. I don\u2019t even know how to go about starting to find recipes for this. I\u2019ve tried looking into vegetarian and vegan stuff but it all seems to use tofu or beans. And if it doesn't have that theres tomatoes! I'm lost. Please, i need clear and precise recipes by the boatload \n\nEdit: They like Italian but the tomatoes are an issue and they don't like pesto. Eggs are ok but they're eating a lot of egg forward food right now and I'm afraid they're going to start turning their nose up to it if I don't introduce more variety. Most veggies are acceptable \n\nEdit: They do eat stir fry, but only very sweet sauces. Quinoa is generally a no. Pancakes and cereal usually go ok. Greek yogurt is a no. \n\nI already sneak creams into foods to bump the calories, am willing to try sneaking in proteins and other things. Pureed beans in sauces? Maybe same with chicken? It's light colored so might work in pale sauces \n\nY'all have some great ideas! Thank you so much\n\nEdit: Damn, this got way more attention than i thought it would and there's no way i can respond to everyone. But, y'all, i've got an actual actionable meal plan that might actually mostly work for the first time in a while and it is a relief. And for those who have suggested it i will absolutely be contacting their doctor about a dietitian. You all are lifesavers, possibly literally.

I have questions and some suggestions. \n\nHave you had lentils cooked by others which you liked? Maybe you just don\u2019t really like lentils. \n\nIf you have had lentils you know you liked, are you trying to cook the same kind of lentils in the same manner?\n\nI think you are speaking of lentils too generally. I would almost never use green lentils in a recipe that called for red lentils. I would rarely try to make Nepalese dal with red lentils or green lentils. The types of lentils are not easily swappable. \n\nWhat texture do you want? \n\nGreen lentils (especially French Lentilles du Puy) stay firmer even when fully cooked. They make good cold salads, for example. Black beluga lentils and brown lentils are also OK in this type of preparation. \n\nFor lentils that break down and thicken a broth, many lentils will work in this fashion. However, some make the end result starchy and very thick while others breakdown but do not become as \u201chearty\u201d. Red masoor dal is a good and common choice of the latter kind. It easily becomes soft and works great in soups or as a slightly thick sauce consistency over rice. However, it never becomes as thick and clinging as urad dal/mung bean dal. Brown lentils kind of fall a bit in the middle. \n\nAnyways, I think a good starting point would be to make a lentil salad. You boil the lentils in water and you can taste them regularly and remove them when they are done to your liking. Green lentils will hold together even when fully cooked more than brown lentils which will crumble a bit when you mix the salad together. Then you make a salad with them the same way you\u2019d make a salad with beans. \n\nThis salad approach will let you cook a smaller batch and commit them to a finished dish with other ingredients only when you know you have a product you like. It will let you experiment with the cooking times and doneness levels with minimal waste."}, {"comment_text": "TL/DR: Couldn't cook a decent lentil if you'd offer me 10 million dollars.\r  \n\r  \nThis has come to a head because I attempted to make curry with split green lentils- supposedly 1 cup lentils, 2 cups water, can of tomatoes (280z).

Starting a few minutes before you think they should be done, use a small spoon and scoop some out (like... 3-5 of them, not a big spoonful) and taste for texture. Do this every minute, on the minute interval, until you've taken them all the way to mush.

What we have found is there are kind of two different kinds. The first is an actual cooking class. The point of them is to teach you how to cook.

Our favorite place we go to like this has a full kitchen, lots of equipment and fully stocked pantries, and the instructors give a lecture and make sure you have everything you need to cook the meal, and then also encourage you to explore and use different equipment and modify the recipe, etc. I leave that place having learned a lot, and often times with a good meal (or sometimes my mods screw it up, but at least I've learned). \n\nSome other places we've been are more like \"you're coming into a restaurant, but you cook your own food, but it's more for fun and a nice dining experience than school.\" These can also be super fun. You show up, they have wine out for you, appetizers laid out, you watch the chef cook something, and you just follow along, exactly replicating it. At the end, you have a restaurant quality meal, and a good time. Maybe they bring you a dessert at the end. \n\nWe like both of these styles.

Add onion. Like blue cheese? Consider adding some. Big fan of smoked Gouda? Add that. To me, it's all subjective and dependent on the tastes of the people who are going to eat it. I know some people that like their mac 'n cheese to be spicy and add everything from \"Frank's Red Hot\" to straight up ghost pepper powder.\n\nThe last time I made a homemade mac 'n cheese, I made a lobster mac used a equal blend of Gruyere, Vermont white cheddar, and Monterey Jack. I also added a splash of dry white wine to the sauce and it was a big hit. Is that the best recipe? Probably not, but that night, we couldn't get enough. The leftovers? Meh. They were okay.\n\nUltimately, don't be afraid to experiment. Make some smaller batches, try some new variations, different cheeses, different seasonings, see what works for you until you come up with a recipe that hits the spots you want it to hit.

I'm so new to cooking, I've been baking for years \nI love the base recipe I have but always feel I'm missing something, I'm thinking mozzarella and cheddar for the cheese and maybe some bacon", "reply_text": "Someone made a comment on baking in another thread earlier today and it reflected something a chemistry teacher said to be 40ish year ago in high school - baking is chemistry with food. And it kind of is. It often depends on certain ingredients at certain temperatures for a certain amount of time and there's not a lot of \"wiggle room\".\n\nPersonally, I've found that to NOT be the case as much with \"cooking\". Something like mac 'n cheese is really forgiving too. For example, bacon is REALLY popular with mac 'n cheese. And whether you add it to the sauce as you're making it so the bacon flavor merges with the cheese throughout or stir crumbled bacon in at the end for random bits of salty bacon flavor as you're eating is yet another personal preference. Both options work and both choices are valid.\n\nWhen picking your cheeses, think of how the melted version of that cheese works too. Mozzarella can give you a stringy consistency (think of the cheese stretch on a pizza slice). If you want that, then mozzarella can work for you. It's why I used Monterey Jack in my lobster mac - it had a touch of the stringy aspect without it being as much as mozzarella would have been.\n\nAnd that was also part of why my leftovers weren't great too. The Gruyere and Vermont cheddar didn't hold up well to chilling and reheating in the microwave. It was a little better if I reheated in a pan with a splash of milk, but still - that was extra effort for leftovers...lol.\n\nSo, have fun experimenting.

Drain and set aside.  Make the mornay sauce. \n\nMornay: Heat milk and half and half on medium low to low heat. You want the milks warmed but not at a simmer. While this heats up, start your roux, melt the butter on medium heat, continue to cook until butter foams and the foam subsides.  Add your flour and cook until a blonde roux.  Add salt, pepper, smoked paprika to taste and ground mustard. Slowly add the warmed milk and half&half to the roux constantly stirring out any lumps until all liquid has been added.  Bring the whole mixture to just at a boil, a few bubbles forming at the surface. Remove from heat.  Stir in half of the cheeses (about 3 cups - you will use the other half when you put it all together) a little at a time, stirring until all cheese is melted.  Check seasonings and add more, if needed to taste. \n\nIn a big bowl or in the pot you boiled the pasta in, mix the sauce with pasta.  \n\nPrepare the baking dish by rubbing butter all over the inside of the dish.
