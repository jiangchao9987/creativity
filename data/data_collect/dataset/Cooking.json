I refuse to order pasta in a restaurant because it's always deeply overpriced for a dish I could knock up at home.", "That's a very good point about the bite.

Pasta sauces benefit greatly from having a bit of the starchy water mixed it, the water then evaporates and leaves the starch behind, making it bind much better and have a better texture.

If someone has served you bucatini with water in it, *they* didn't cook it right at all. You don't have to care for it, of course, but the flaw is with the cooks, same as when people think steaks are inherently tough and leathery because they've only had them cooked badly (or when I thought I didn't like pork just because my mom overcooked it to death, or cauliflower because I'd only had microwaved frozen cauliflower).", "The water will boil off.\n\nAlso, the shape is great for any pasta with larger chunks (like Bolognese) since they actually fit inside the pasta.", "Penne lisce \ud83d\ude43", "If you held a gun to my head and said \u201cpick 6 that\u2019s all you can have *forever*, I could list them off in maybe a minute no biggie\n\nI\u2019d be mad that you held a gun to my head, but otherwise no biggie.", "I hate penne, although I think I should like it, as rigatoni is my absolute fave and it should be just a slightly inferior version.

Nope, I loved it and wanted to eat pieces of butter even more. I would sneak butter sometimes.

I got a pack of cookies to dip in my coffee at night and she ate the entire box in one sitting. She'll do it with anything sweet the second it hits the shelf. She will say she's not hungry at dinner, eat almost nothing, wait until we get busy or go to bed, and then hunt down the fruit snacks and eat an entire large box.

I'd say you actually have enjoyed some of the ones that are considered challenging (onions, bell pepper, tomato (in its raw form) all occasionally run afoul of self-described picky eaters) so you're doing great! Something that I only came to very recently has been showcasing the power of a vegetable entirely on its own without necessarily needing to process or transform it so severely. The broiler rack of everyones' oven (the top coil that goes to 550) is a hidden weapon that is criminally underutilized. Take zucchini or a carrots, slice them thickly at a long bias (like at least an inch thick but also long and angular), then lightly score them on one of the flat sides with a thatch pattern. salt generously and set on a wire rack above some paper towels at a slight angle. Let them sit like this for 30 minutes or so until a good bit of moisture has been wicked out by the salt onto the paper towels, then blot dry, put in a mixing bowl. coat lightly with olive oil and toss with salt and pepper. Put these on a sheet pan thatch cuts up (you could even put the wire rack with the vegetables still on it on top of the sheet pan for more or less total separation from the pan) and put them on the top rack of the oven, preheated to broil at 550. There isn't so much of a time limit here as there is a desired result (but probably between 5 and 10 minutes checking regularly) which is a heavily browned maillard reacted top with a just perfectly roasted vegetable below that browning (good zucchini won't be faded green on the sides but deep bold green and carrots wouldn't be sad but rather also bold or deep orange.) Basically you get an ideal presentation that can stand alone as a side to a major entree meat. Enough transformation too in the form of the browned top to really get that pleasing nuttiness but with a still fresh and idealized featured vegetable taste. This same method works with eggplant, brussels, broccoli.. so much (though not all of them require thatching as you'll find). Doing this to the onion family like onions, shallots, green onions - to the point of actually burning or br\u00fbl\u00e9eing them will serve as insanely flavorful replacements for just regular onions and aromatics in a lot of stewed dishes like pot roasts, gumbos, etouffees, some indian food etc..

TBH I suspect you could probably add a handful of spinach to most waffle recipes and it would be good if you blended it up enough. I also like to add a handful of shredded cheese to the batter.", "I add zucchini or summer squash and eggplant in my tomato sauce after roasting them", "You can try adding finely grated carrots, pureed bell peppers, or diced tomatoes into your pasta sauce.", "Why not just focus on being less of a picky eater? Then you don't need to hide veggies from yourself.", "Working on it, can't change myself overnight.", "That's really good dude. I've seen a lot of people in your position just outright refuse to do so.", "Zucchini brownies are fantastic - I made up a pan one time and the only thing that got my ex to stop eating them was telling him that they were loaded with zucchini. \n\nAlso Indian food has a bunch of vegetables - samosas are made with potatoes, peas, and a bunch of delicious seasonings. Pakora is vegetable fritters. Saag is loaded with spinach, masala has tomatoes, the list goes on.", "I forgot about samosas!!! I love those!!", "Food processor or blender.

I want to experiment and create a special drink for someone and they adore peonies.\n\nI don't have any fresh, but I do have dried peony petals - I'm hoping I can still do something with them instead.\n\nAny tips, suggestions or recipes out there? \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "Go with dried. Entensifies flavor. And does not water syrup down.", "so i just made escovich for the first time and the recipe i used said to saute the onions and veggies in the same pan as the fish was fried in and then drizzle the vinegar sauce onto the fish when done, but what i didn\u2019t understand was whether i should remove the cooking oil before saut\u00e9ing the veggies cos otherwise id basically be drizzling oil sauce onto my fish, but at the same time the vinegar kind of cooked away so im a bit confused on the last step!! also if anyone has replacements for scotch bonnet peppers lmk, we dont have them here", "Yes, do remove most of the oil and only leave enough to saute the vegetables.\n\nHabanero is likely the easier to find, yet closest to heat and fruitiness to scotch bonnet.\n\nIn Filipino escabeche, the sauce is thickened with cornstarch slurry.", "hmm im in ethiopia so a lot of cooking is done with \u201cberbere\u201d and \u201cmitmita\u201d idk the english names and google translates them as pepper. ill search for habanero tho at vegetable places.  also how much vinegar would u put, the recipe i used said 6tsp or tbsp i cant remember but i put 6tsp and it seemed like too little", "If you can't find bonnets or habaneros, at least search for something that looks similar. Basically stuff that looks like miniature bell peppers (colour doesn't really matter btw), as opposed to long shaped chilies.  \n\nThere's no guarantee, but these species tend to have a special fruity flavour that you just don't get from long chilies.  \n\nAlso: habanero or bonnet hot sauce might be easier to find than fresh peppers, and could work as a decent sub in many Caribbean recipes.", "Habanero could easily be a substitute  \nBut just in general - escovich is entirely different from ceviche (nothing is cooked). You might find more recipes or videos by focusing on one vs the other - and other recipes may answer some of your concerns.", "alright thank you! i think either i misread the recipe but it said 6tsp or tbsp of vinegar. i put 6tsp and it seemed like way to little so i added some more but is there an amount ud recommend?", "No idea, I'm more of a ceviche person :) And you kind of measure with your heart for that bc you are using limes. \n\nBut realistically it must be TBSP bc you would use a larger measure then 6 TSP in my opinion, esp for a liquid.", "ye i figured after i finished eating ahahahaha. most of the ingredients were measured in tsp so i think i automatically read it as tsp ahahah\u2026 thanks for the tips! also ye i just looked up ceviche and they are not at all the same thing but the recipe page thing compared it to ceviche. will try it sometime im still pretty new to cooking. rn i just try and make stuff ive had that was good"]
