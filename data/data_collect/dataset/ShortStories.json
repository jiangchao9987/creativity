Do you have a self-established universe you\u2019ve been writing or planning to write in? Do you have an idea for a world that\u2019s been itching to get out? This is the perfect place to explore that. Each week, I post a theme to inspire you, along with a related image and song. You have 500 - 1000 words to write your installment. You can jump in at any time; writing for previous weeks\u2019 is not necessary in order to join. After you\u2019ve posted, come back and provide feedback for at least 1 other writer on the thread. Please be sure to read the entire post for a full list of rules.\n***\n#This Week\u2019s Theme is Traditions!       \n\n[**Image**](https://www.deviantart.com/renjuart/art/Mayan-Dance-528323563)  | [**Song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E5s-KEKO3Q)            \n    \n**Bonus Word List** (each included word is worth 5 pts) - **Please list which words you included at the end of your story.**                  \n- tasty                                 \n- taboo                                                                                                           \n- transient                                                                                                                               \n- [tartle](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/tartle)          \n                                          \n         \n This week we\u2019re diving into the theme of \u2018traditions\u2019. Many cultures have traditions that go back ages. They provide us with a sense of order and comfort. They help us feel closer to our roots, our families, our communities, and even our gods. How do traditions vary between the people in your worlds? Are there practices that seem strange to outsiders? How do your characters deal with their beliefs being judged or challenged? What would happen if someone prohibited those practices?    \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n- April 28 - Traditions (this week)        \n- May 5 - Undermine    \n- May 12 - Void    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Struggle](https://new.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/sersun_serial_sunday_struggle/?sort=old)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0udn1m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel   \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l13tjke/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/mattswritingaccount                        \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0srjc6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing               \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l1hefgp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/LuminescenTT                      \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0suc6h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MaxStickies                                                                                   \n            \n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below. This feature has requirements for participation!     \n\n- **Submit a story inspired by the weekly theme, written by you and set in your *self-established* universe that is 500 - 1000 words. No fanfics and no content created or altered by AI.** (Use wordcounter.net to check your wordcount.) Stories should be posted as a top-level comment below. If you\u2019re continuing an in-progress serial (not on Serial Sunday), please include links to your previous installments. \n\n- **Your chapter must be submitted by Saturday at 9:00am EST.** Late entries will be disqualified. All submissions should be given (at least) a *basic editing pass* before being posted!\n\n- **Begin your post with the name of your serial between triangle brackets** (e.g. <My Awesome Serial>). When our bot is back up and running, this will allow it to recognize your serial and add each chapter to the SerSun catalog. Do not include anything in the brackets you don\u2019t want in your title. (Please note: You must use this same title every week.)\n\n- **Do not pre-write your serial.** You\u2019re welcome to do outlining and planning for your serial, but chapters should not be pre-written. All submissions should be written for this post, specifically.\n\n- **Only one active serial per author at a time.** This does not apply to serials written outside of Serial Sunday. \n\n- **All Serial Sunday authors must leave feedback on at least one story on the thread each week.** The feedback should be **actionable** and also include something the author has done well. When you include something the author should improve on, provide an example! You have until **Saturday at 11:59pm EST** to post your feedback. (Submitting late is not an exception to this rule.)     \n\n- **Missing your feedback requirement two or more consecutive weeks will disqualify you from rankings and Campfire readings the following week.** If it becomes a habit, you may be asked to move your serial to the sub instead.\n\n- **Serials must abide by subreddit content rules.** You can view a [full list of rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/index/rules). If you\u2019re ever unsure if your story would cross the line, please modmail and ask!\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Weekly Campfires & Voting:\n\n- **On Saturdays at 1pm EST, I host a Serial Sunday Campfire in our [Discord\u2019s Voice Lounge](https://discord.gg/writingprompts).** Join us to read your story aloud, hear others, and exchange feedback.

Do you have a self-established universe you\u2019ve been writing or planning to write in? Do you have an idea for a world that\u2019s been itching to get out? This is the perfect place to explore that. Each week, I post a theme to inspire you, along with a related image and song. You have 500 - 1000 words to write your installment. You can jump in at any time; writing for previous weeks\u2019 is not necessary in order to join. After you\u2019ve posted, come back and provide feedback for at least 1 other writer on the thread.

Many cultures have traditions that go back ages. They provide us with a sense of order and comfort. They help us feel closer to our roots, our families, our communities, and even our gods. How do traditions vary between the people in your worlds? Are there practices that seem strange to outsiders? How do your characters deal with their beliefs being judged or challenged? What would happen if someone prohibited those practices?    \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n- April 28 - Traditions (this week)        \n- May 5 - Undermine    \n- May 12 - Void    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Struggle](https://new.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/sersun_serial_sunday_struggle/?sort=old)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0udn1m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel   \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l13tjke/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/mattswritingaccount                        \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0srjc6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing               \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l1hefgp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/LuminescenTT                      \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0suc6h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MaxStickies                                                                                   \n            \n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below. This feature has requirements for participation!     \n\n- **Submit a story inspired by the weekly theme, written by you and set in your *self-established* universe that is 500 - 1000 words. No fanfics and no content created or altered by AI.** (Use wordcounter.net to check your wordcount.) Stories should be posted as a top-level comment below. If you\u2019re continuing an in-progress serial (not on Serial Sunday), please include links to your previous installments. \n\n- **Your chapter must be submitted by Saturday at 9:00am EST.** Late entries will be disqualified. All submissions should be given (at least) a *basic editing pass* before being posted!\n\n- **Begin your post with the name of your serial between triangle brackets** (e.g. <My Awesome Serial>). When our bot is back up and running, this will allow it to recognize your serial and add each chapter to the SerSun catalog. Do not include anything in the brackets you don\u2019t want in your title. (Please note: You must use this same title every week.)\n\n- **Do not pre-write your serial.** You\u2019re welcome to do outlining and planning for your serial, but chapters should not be pre-written. All submissions should be written for this post, specifically.\n\n- **Only one active serial per author at a time.** This does not apply to serials written outside of Serial Sunday. \n\n- **All Serial Sunday authors must leave feedback on at least one story on the thread each week.** The feedback should be **actionable** and also include something the author has done well. When you include something the author should improve on, provide an example! You have until **Saturday at 11:59pm EST** to post your feedback. (Submitting late is not an exception to this rule.)     \n\n- **Missing your feedback requirement two or more consecutive weeks will disqualify you from rankings and Campfire readings the following week.** If it becomes a habit, you may be asked to move your serial to the sub instead.\n\n- **Serials must abide by subreddit content rules.** You can view a [full list of rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/index/rules). If you\u2019re ever unsure if your story would cross the line, please modmail and ask!\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Weekly Campfires & Voting:\n\n- **On Saturdays at 1pm EST, I host a Serial Sunday Campfire in our [Discord\u2019s Voice Lounge](https://discord.gg/writingprompts).** Join us to read your story aloud, hear others, and exchange feedback.

You do not have to participate to make nominations!\n\n- **Authors who complete their Serial Sunday serials with at least 12 installments, can host a SerialWorm in our Discord\u2019s Voice Lounge, where you read aloud your finished and edited serials.** Celebrate your accomplishment!

Though the load is light, the shape of the container makes it cumbersome, ensuring a long, plodding walk through the corridors. Servants who pass him chatter with each other, complaining about the difficulties of their days; with his work still on-going, he is glad his position is only transient.\n\nAs he nears the washroom, he spots Orethia walking his way. She stops before him and looks around.\n\n\u201cGive me that,\u201d she says, \u201cthe Queen wishes to see you.\u201d\n\nHe raises an eyebrow. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t use titles?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you have remembered who I meant if I said Udret?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 fair point.\u201d He hands her the basket. \u201cDo you know what for?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo idea; she rarely shares her plans to multiple spies.\u201d\n\n*Hmm. I hope she hasn\u2019t caught on, for real this time.* \u201cAnd where am I going?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer chambers; upper floor of the servant corridors, you\u2019ll find a set of double doors inlaid with gold, on the other side of which there is a bridge that crosses into the palace proper. You\u2019ll want the first door on your right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nShe nods before making her way to the washroom. While he walks to the stairs, Thosius ponders on what he might find in a royal\u2019s rooms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpon entering the chambers, Thosius is immediately struck by an awful stench. He pinches his nose, almost doubling over with nausea, trying to keep the bile down. Straining his eyes to look onward, he spots the Queen in the centre of a lavish space; green and blue drapes line the walls, spooling out across a red diamond-patterned carpet. Her Majesty kneels in a thick woollen outfit of colours matching the room about her, and before her is a lump of stone atop a wooden block. As he gets closer, he sees it is a carving of a finned creature. He bows once he is close.\n\n\u201cRise,\u201d Udret orders, not turning her head. \u201cSuch displays of formality have become wearisome to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, your Majesty,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou were not to know.\u201d\n\nHe notices for the first time the bowl beside the statuette\u2019s mouth. The Queen takes a long stick from a pocket and strikes it against the stone, setting its end alight. This she places in the bowl. Something burns within, eliciting smoke that reeks of the foul odour.\n\n\u201cIf I may ask,\u201d he says, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would question a queen on her actions?\u201d A wry smile creeps along her cheek.\n\n\u201cMerely out of curiosity, your Majesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough of that, too. I just want a normal conversation, for once this day.\u201d She sighs. \u201cIn any case, your interest is understandable. You do not have customs like this in these lands, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot that I know of.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack in my homeland, the domain of Merukta, people worship animal spirits by burning offerings to them. We believe that the smoke transcends the mortal plain and provides nourishment to said spirits.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what is this animal?\u201d\n\nNow she turns her face to him, appearing bemused. \u201cReally? You have no clue what this is?\u201d\r  \n\u201cAfraid not. I\u2019m guessing it lives in the sea, and I\u2019ve never even been to the coast.\u201d\n\n\u201cAstute at least, even in your ignorance. Your word for it is a \u2018whale\u2019, I think.\u201d\n\n*Why am I asking questions? I feel like I\u2019m about to hurl.* \u201cAnd they eat stuff that smells like *that*?\u201d\n\n\u201cKrill, yes. It does stink somewhat, I agree, but living near the sea makes one used to such aromas. I even ate krill, one time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it nice?\u201d He tries to stop himself from grimacing at the thought.\n\n\u201cIt *was* quite tasty; though, the fort did harbour the scent of their cooking for quite some time.\u201d\n\nThosius stifles a laugh, for on opening his mouth, he feels fluid rising in his throat. He brings a hand up.\n\n\u201cYour curiosity has gotten the better of you,\u201d the Queen says. \u201cMight have been more prudent to ask of what I wish of you, no?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you could, I\u2019d be thankful,\u201d he grunts through clenched teeth.\n\n\u201cOf course. I\u2019ve seen much of Eruthan recently, the man seemingly spending far more of his time wandering the corridors; in preparation for the big event, I presume\u2026\u201d\n\n*Wait, what big event? Eruthan didn\u2019t tell me of one.*\n\n\u201cAnd I have seen a glint in his eye, whenever he looks at me. I surmise that he is aware of my knowledge of your role in his little network of spies. Which means you must have told him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told him nothing, your Majesty.\u201d\n\nShe glares. \u201cYou really cannot help yourself, can you? In any case, you are worth more to me alive than dead, even now. I believe a change of plans is needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? Has something happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I sent one of my spies to follow a servant I believed to be working for Eruthan. Yesterday, Orethia found her dead by the stairs, her throat sliced wide open. I have ensured this has not gotten out, otherwise there would be pandemonium.\u201d\n\nHe feigns surprise as he says, \u201cThat\u2019s horrible!\u201d \n\nShe smirks. \u201cYou truly are a bad actor, Thistrus, or whatever your real name is. I need you to answer me truthfully: did Eruthan have one of my girls killed?\u201d\n\n*Let\u2019s keep it simple.* \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, you can tell the truth! And it is as I suspected; which means there must be a third party infiltrating the servants, one that I know naught about. This\u2026 concerns me greatly. So, you will send a message to Eruthan.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course; what is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is to meet me at midnight in the central courtyard, under the cover of the willow. There, we shall discuss plans and tell each other all we know, that may help solve this problem. That is all.\u201d\n\nThosius frowns. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you must persuade him, Thistrus.

I need you to answer me truthfully: did Eruthan have one of my girls killed?\u201d\n\n*Let\u2019s keep it simple.* \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, you can tell the truth! And it is as I suspected; which means there must be a third party infiltrating the servants, one that I know naught about. This\u2026 concerns me greatly. So, you will send a message to Eruthan.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course; what is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is to meet me at midnight in the central courtyard, under the cover of the willow. There, we shall discuss plans and tell each other all we know, that may help solve this problem. That is all.\u201d\n\nThosius frowns. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you must persuade him, Thistrus. Surely you can do that?\u201d\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWC: 1000\n\nBonus words: tasty, transient\n\nCrit and feedback are welcome.\n\n[Chapter Index](https://new.reddit.com/r/StickiesStories/comments/16ilkx0/thosius_chapter_index/)", "comment_created_utc": 1714337380.0, "reply_text": "Howdy Max!\n\nI *love* the title.

Do you have a self-established universe you\u2019ve been writing or planning to write in? Do you have an idea for a world that\u2019s been itching to get out? This is the perfect place to explore that. Each week, I post a theme to inspire you, along with a related image and song. You have 500 - 1000 words to write your installment. You can jump in at any time; writing for previous weeks\u2019 is not necessary in order to join. After you\u2019ve posted, come back and provide feedback for at least 1 other writer on the thread. Please be sure to read the entire post for a full list of rules.\n***\n#This Week\u2019s Theme is Traditions!       \n\n[**Image**](https://www.deviantart.com/renjuart/art/Mayan-Dance-528323563)  | [**Song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E5s-KEKO3Q)            \n    \n**Bonus Word List** (each included word is worth 5 pts) - **Please list which words you included at the end of your story.**                  \n- tasty                                 \n- taboo                                                                                                           \n- transient                                                                                                                               \n- [tartle](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/tartle)          \n                                          \n         \n This week we\u2019re diving into the theme of \u2018traditions\u2019. Many cultures have traditions that go back ages. They provide us with a sense of order and comfort. They help us feel closer to our roots, our families, our communities, and even our gods. How do traditions vary between the people in your worlds? Are there practices that seem strange to outsiders? How do your characters deal with their beliefs being judged or challenged? What would happen if someone prohibited those practices?    \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n- April 28 - Traditions (this week)        \n- May 5 - Undermine    \n- May 12 - Void    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Struggle](https://new.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/sersun_serial_sunday_struggle/?sort=old)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0udn1m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel   \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l13tjke/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/mattswritingaccount                        \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0srjc6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing               \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l1hefgp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/LuminescenTT                      \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0suc6h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MaxStickies                                                                                   \n            \n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below. This feature has requirements for participation!     \n\n- **Submit a story inspired by the weekly theme, written by you and set in your *self-established* universe that is 500 - 1000 words. No fanfics and no content created or altered by AI.** (Use wordcounter.net to check your wordcount.) Stories should be posted as a top-level comment below. If you\u2019re continuing an in-progress serial (not on Serial Sunday), please include links to your previous installments. \n\n- **Your chapter must be submitted by Saturday at 9:00am EST.** Late entries will be disqualified. All submissions should be given (at least) a *basic editing pass* before being posted!\n\n- **Begin your post with the name of your serial between triangle brackets** (e.g. <My Awesome Serial>). When our bot is back up and running, this will allow it to recognize your serial and add each chapter to the SerSun catalog. Do not include anything in the brackets you don\u2019t want in your title. (Please note: You must use this same title every week.)\n\n- **Do not pre-write your serial.** You\u2019re welcome to do outlining and planning for your serial, but chapters should not be pre-written. All submissions should be written for this post, specifically.\n\n- **Only one active serial per author at a time.** This does not apply to serials written outside of Serial Sunday. \n\n- **All Serial Sunday authors must leave feedback on at least one story on the thread each week.** The feedback should be **actionable** and also include something the author has done well. When you include something the author should improve on, provide an example! You have until **Saturday at 11:59pm EST** to post your feedback. (Submitting late is not an exception to this rule.)     \n\n- **Missing your feedback requirement two or more consecutive weeks will disqualify you from rankings and Campfire readings the following week.** If it becomes a habit, you may be asked to move your serial to the sub instead.\n\n- **Serials must abide by subreddit content rules.** You can view a [full list of rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/index/rules). If you\u2019re ever unsure if your story would cross the line, please modmail and ask!\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Weekly Campfires & Voting:\n\n- **On Saturdays at 1pm EST, I host a Serial Sunday Campfire in our [Discord\u2019s Voice Lounge](https://discord.gg/writingprompts).** Join us to read your story aloud, hear others, and exchange feedback.

It was Gunny\u2019s turn to exact some payback, or at least that\u2019s what I assumed was about to happen as she stood over him with cold eyes. She pulled up a discarded crate and sat down so she was on the same level with the bastard. His layered eyelids grew wide as she began to speak in his native tongue. \n\nWe had no idea what she said, but for some reason his face softened as she emitted various growls and squawks in the rhythm of his home world. He began to respond to what I figured were questions as she moved her arms and hands with the intended gestures which were part of his spoken word. The team stood in awed silence while the master went about her work on the captured Gemini. At one point, she even smiled and chuckled while she shook her head in the affirmative.\n\n\u201cKroger.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, Gunny?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have an extra nicotine rig in your ruck?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do Gunny, why?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need more information\u2026\u201d is all Gunny Campbell said in response.\n\nDoc Jenkins looked up from mending my shoulder with concern when Gunny asked for the nicotine stick. I grimaced when she cinched the containment bond tightly into place and abruptly moved to disrupt Gunny\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cExcuse me Gunnery Sergeant, but I have to assess the prisoner,\u201d interrupted Doc Jenkins before Kroger could hand Gunny Campbell her extra nicotine vapor rig. \n\n\u201cOf course Doc\u2026\u201d Gunny obliged and then informed the prisoner that our Medical Technician was about to check out his wounds. \n\nHe nodded his head slowly and then winced as Doc Jenkins began her examination.\n\n\u201cWhat did the motherfucker say?\u201d asked Kroger after she exhaled a cloud of vapor.\n\n\u201cWell for one thing Kroger, he is just a kid, so go easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t we all, what\u2019s your point?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said ease up Kroger! \u00a0His mum was the one Jackie painted to that con-tower\u2026 he\u2019s a little fucked in the head right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMother!?\u201d Lexi exclaimed in horror.\n\n\u201cHayup\u2026 young _Jimmy_ warriors often fight along side their parents until one or the other falls in battle; which they find preferable to dying of old age,\u201d Gunny articulated.\n\n\u201cLike ancient Spartans,\u201d Abby Edward chimed.\n\n\u201cCorrect Miss Edward. Humans exhibited this same behavior for much of our existence.\u201d\n\n_Oh my God, we killed his mom!_ Elsa sobbed.\n\n\u201cI spent a lot of time with Gemini grunts during their own war with the Nobodies. I\u2019m pretty sure this one\u2019s not a sniper,\u201d Abby contended.\n\n\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d Gunny asked somewhat annoyed.\n\n\u201cWell for one, he lacks the ceremonial laser brandings their ground pounders receive once they are fully initiated as _Soldiers Afoot_.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bad Miss Edward, anything else you'd like enlighten us on\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cGemini sniper\u2019s are generally female... Much like humans, their women are better suited for the dynamic complexities of long-range shooting.\u201d\n\nAbby examined the Gemini further, then spoke the language only he and Gunny Campbell could understand. The kid replied and nudged his head in my direction while his eyes locked with mine.\n\n\u201cJa\u2026 Jad..Jade Owin...\u201d the Gemini kid uttered in an attempt at human language.\n\n\u201cDa Fuck you just say!\u201d I snapped and lunged at him despite my shoulder, while the rest of the team sprang to restrain me.\n\nGunny Campbell began a fury of Gemini as I struggled to break free from those holding me back. Her face grew long in disbelief as the teenager responded to her interrogated assault. \u201c\u2026Jade Owens\u2026.\u201d, were the only words any of us understood as she and the kid rebutted back and forth. \n\n\u201cShit!\u201d muttered Gunny before she abruptly stood up, \u201cCom\u2019on Owens, you and I need to have a little chat; in private\u2026 Miss Edward, consider this whole interaction beholden to your non-disclosure agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou better go,\u201d said Kroger as the team released me.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nDiane Campbell and I stood alone, her uncovered hair buffeted against the desert wind.

It was Gunny\u2019s turn to exact some payback, or at least that\u2019s what I assumed was about to happen as she stood over him with cold eyes. She pulled up a discarded crate and sat down so she was on the same level with the bastard. His layered eyelids grew wide as she began to speak in his native tongue. \n\nWe had no idea what she said, but for some reason his face softened as she emitted various growls and squawks in the rhythm of his home world. He began to respond to what I figured were questions as she moved her arms and hands with the intended gestures which were part of his spoken word. The team stood in awed silence while the master went about her work on the captured Gemini. At one point, she even smiled and chuckled while she shook her head in the affirmative.\n\n\u201cKroger.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes, Gunny?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have an extra nicotine rig in your ruck?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do Gunny, why?\u201d\n\n\u201cI need more information\u2026\u201d is all Gunny Campbell said in response.\n\nDoc Jenkins looked up from mending my shoulder with concern when Gunny asked for the nicotine stick. I grimaced when she cinched the containment bond tightly into place and abruptly moved to disrupt Gunny\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cExcuse me Gunnery Sergeant, but I have to assess the prisoner,\u201d interrupted Doc Jenkins before Kroger could hand Gunny Campbell her extra nicotine vapor rig. \n\n\u201cOf course Doc\u2026\u201d Gunny obliged and then informed the prisoner that our Medical Technician was about to check out his wounds. \n\nHe nodded his head slowly and then winced as Doc Jenkins began her examination.\n\n\u201cWhat did the motherfucker say?\u201d asked Kroger after she exhaled a cloud of vapor.\n\n\u201cWell for one thing Kroger, he is just a kid, so go easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t we all, what\u2019s your point?\u201d\n\n\u201cI said ease up Kroger! \u00a0His mum was the one Jackie painted to that con-tower\u2026 he\u2019s a little fucked in the head right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cMother!?\u201d Lexi exclaimed in horror.\n\n\u201cHayup\u2026 young _Jimmy_ warriors often fight along side their parents until one or the other falls in battle; which they find preferable to dying of old age,\u201d Gunny articulated.\n\n\u201cLike ancient Spartans,\u201d Abby Edward chimed.\n\n\u201cCorrect Miss Edward. Humans exhibited this same behavior for much of our existence.\u201d\n\n_Oh my God, we killed his mom!_ Elsa sobbed.\n\n\u201cI spent a lot of time with Gemini grunts during their own war with the Nobodies. I\u2019m pretty sure this one\u2019s not a sniper,\u201d Abby contended.\n\n\u201cWhat makes you so sure?\u201d Gunny asked somewhat annoyed.\n\n\u201cWell for one, he lacks the ceremonial laser brandings their ground pounders receive once they are fully initiated as _Soldiers Afoot_.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bad Miss Edward, anything else you'd like enlighten us on\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cGemini sniper\u2019s are generally female... Much like humans, their women are better suited for the dynamic complexities of long-range shooting.\u201d\n\nAbby examined the Gemini further, then spoke the language only he and Gunny Campbell could understand. The kid replied and nudged his head in my direction while his eyes locked with mine.\n\n\u201cJa\u2026 Jad..Jade Owin...\u201d the Gemini kid uttered in an attempt at human language.\n\n\u201cDa Fuck you just say!\u201d I snapped and lunged at him despite my shoulder, while the rest of the team sprang to restrain me.\n\nGunny Campbell began a fury of Gemini as I struggled to break free from those holding me back. Her face grew long in disbelief as the teenager responded to her interrogated assault. \u201c\u2026Jade Owens\u2026.\u201d, were the only words any of us understood as she and the kid rebutted back and forth. \n\n\u201cShit!\u201d muttered Gunny before she abruptly stood up, \u201cCom\u2019on Owens, you and I need to have a little chat; in private\u2026 Miss Edward, consider this whole interaction beholden to your non-disclosure agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou better go,\u201d said Kroger as the team released me.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nDiane Campbell and I stood alone, her uncovered hair buffeted against the desert wind. She reached up and powered down her AI module, something we always did when we were about to say shit we didn\u2019t want documented.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m going to tell you, stays right here, understood?\u201d\n\nI nodded my head.\n\n\u201cThat Gemini kid; he told your reporter friend\u2026 _you have the look of his aunt._\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d I exclaimed.\n\n\u201cJackson\u2026 when Gemini take prisoners of war, they sometimes integrate them into their society.

I feel this week's installment was very important for the story arc, especially for setting in the conflict going forward. I made some changes based on your observations that I hope clear things up.\n\nMy greatest challenge this week was trying to convey a natural underlying tension between Gunny and the reporter Abby Edward, particularly from the perspective of the latter. This speaks to a sentiment shared by many in the American military toward the press, particularly amongst veterans of the Vietnam War. It may not be justified, but the idea that the press negatively affects the outcome of military operations is a common notion which persisted even into the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Many cultures have traditions that go back ages. They provide us with a sense of order and comfort. They help us feel closer to our roots, our families, our communities, and even our gods. How do traditions vary between the people in your worlds? Are there practices that seem strange to outsiders? How do your characters deal with their beliefs being judged or challenged? What would happen if someone prohibited those practices?    \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n- April 28 - Traditions (this week)        \n- May 5 - Undermine    \n- May 12 - Void    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Struggle](https://new.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/sersun_serial_sunday_struggle/?sort=old)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0udn1m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel   \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l13tjke/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/mattswritingaccount                        \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0srjc6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing               \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l1hefgp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/LuminescenTT                      \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0suc6h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MaxStickies                                                                                   \n            \n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below.

All submissions should be given (at least) a *basic editing pass* before being posted!\n\n- **Begin your post with the name of your serial between triangle brackets** (e.g. <My Awesome Serial>). When our bot is back up and running, this will allow it to recognize your serial and add each chapter to the SerSun catalog. Do not include anything in the brackets you don\u2019t want in your title. (Please note: You must use this same title every week.)\n\n- **Do not pre-write your serial.** You\u2019re welcome to do outlining and planning for your serial, but chapters should not be pre-written.

It extends all the way to a few inches away from the front door; candles are placed at every single corner, golden plates in front of the chairs. The demon feels rich just being here. \r  \n\r  \nThe door opens to reveal Linda, who\u2019s wearing more casual clothes. Her long dress sparkles, diamonds all down its front. She walks to the head of the table with a smile on her face. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cDid you rest well, honored guest?\u201d she asks. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cAh, yes I did! Though, I\u2019m surprised you invited me for dinner.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cOf course! As tradition, if someone helps us with something, we must pay them back.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nLinda leans back a bit, her hands on her lap. She seems calmer, more at ease. It makes him happy to see her relax for the time being. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell, to be honest, I didn\u2019t come here to just celebrate.\u201d She straightens back up. \u201cI know you\u2019re helping the other kingdoms, and I\u2019m thankful. So, I\u2019ll answer any questions you have.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cAh, are you sure? Shouldn\u2019t we be relaxing first?\u201d \r  \n\r  \nThe queen chuckles. \u201cNonsense. In a way, this is relaxing. I do love talking about history and politics after all.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell\u2026before that, there\u2019s something I've been wondering. About the Mad One people keep talking about. Who is he exactly?\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cAh, our old king.\u201d She sighs, putting her finger to her chin as she continues. \u201cHe was a ruthless monster. Before Fye and I came to rule, he was our king. He actually killed our first king. He planned to take power for years, but once he got it, the responsibility crushed him.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo he forced the demons into that bloody competition for the seat of king and queen?\u201d \r  \n\r  \nLinda nods. \u201cAfter enough nagging from other kingdoms, he had enough and made people kill each other to get his position. I personally wanted to be queen so I could help everyone. Luckily enough, I made it.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nAlex frowns. He can\u2019t fathom the amount of hardship and guilt she went through to get to where she is now. \r  \n\r  \n*Fye too\u2026*\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re curious about our first king also? I can tell from your face.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cOh, you caught me,\u201d he chuckles. \r  \n\r  \nLinda leans back again. \u201cHe was one of the best kings out there. He believed in empathy, and that emotions actually make us stronger. My family honors that belief. And I do too.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWhat about the rest of Pride?\u201d \r  \n\r  \nLinda shakes her head, her lips curving into a frown. \u201cThe Mad One changed their belief slowly. Emotions were looked down on, even shamed. It became taboo. It wasn\u2019t until Fye and I ruled that it became normal again. But even then, as you saw, people are still against it.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n*That\u2019s why most of the demons focus on fighting rather than working on themselves.* \r  \n\r  \nAlex thinks of Evan. \r  \n\r  \nAll this time, the hypnotist has been fighting against the urge to show his emotions. He seemed coldhearted, but when he removed his mask, he was like a little boy who didn't know how to express himself. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI hope it changes someday.\u201d Alex speaks without thinking. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt will. We have already made some progress. But, changing an entire society isn\u2019t easy.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nThere is a moment of silence.\r  \n\r  \n*\"It's just\u2026I don't like them as much. They only think about themselves.\"*\r  \n\r  \nThose shameful words. Alex learned back on Earth how bad stereotyping could be, and just learning the truth about Pride makes his own heart ache. \r  \n\r  \n*Now that I think about it, humans really hate demons. But every demon I\u2019ve encountered so far hasn\u2019t really been terrible. But will the world truly believe me?* \r  \n\r  \nHe shakes that thought off.\r  \n\r  \n*No, I need to focus on saving all of Hell. I can worry about Earth later.* \r  \n\r  \n\u201cUmm, Linda. I\u2019m planning on going to the next kingdom. Do you have any recommendations?\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cHmm.\u201d Linda closes her eyes for a moment. \u201cI recommend going to Apocryphal District, the kingdom of Lust. Just recently, they crowned a new queen named Megan Bessel. They say her heart is as cold as the snow, but I disagree.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cCold as the snow? Why would they say that?\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cEasy. In Lust, people focus on affection, caring, and emotions. She doesn\u2019t seem to have any of that. Just focusing on her work. But in my opinion, she does care about people, just in her own way.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n*The kingdoms in each region so far have their ups and downs when it comes to their beliefs and values. Will they actually be able to work together in the future?* \r  \n\r  \nHe looks back at Linda. \r  \n\r  \n*Actually, there's been an effort to change it already. There\u2019s still hope.* \r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell, I believe we\u2019ve had enough chit-chat. Are you ready to eat?\u201d \r  \n\r  \nAlex nods, drooling a bit at the mention of food. \u201cI\u2019ve been curious about what Pride\u2019s food tastes like. Thank you again.\u201d \r\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWPC: 816\n\nWahh!

This is the perfect place to explore that. Each week, I post a theme to inspire you, along with a related image and song. You have 500 - 1000 words to write your installment. You can jump in at any time; writing for previous weeks\u2019 is not necessary in order to join. After you\u2019ve posted, come back and provide feedback for at least 1 other writer on the thread.

Many cultures have traditions that go back ages. They provide us with a sense of order and comfort. They help us feel closer to our roots, our families, our communities, and even our gods. How do traditions vary between the people in your worlds? Are there practices that seem strange to outsiders? How do your characters deal with their beliefs being judged or challenged? What would happen if someone prohibited those practices?    \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n- April 28 - Traditions (this week)        \n- May 5 - Undermine    \n- May 12 - Void    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Struggle](https://new.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/sersun_serial_sunday_struggle/?sort=old)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0udn1m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel   \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l13tjke/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/mattswritingaccount                        \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0srjc6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing               \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l1hefgp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/LuminescenTT                      \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0suc6h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MaxStickies                                                                                   \n            \n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below.

And it was beautiful, the soft color of leaves and trees instead of the harsh brightness of snow on the other side. Her heart leapt with joy to see it.\n\nMaltis groaned next to her, uncurling from her position on one of the chairs. She blinked at the sight through the window.  \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the extended `Gregorian calendar`, today is `February seventh` of the year five `thousand` four `hundred` and ten,\u201d Elfo helpfully chirped.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cApologies. This is the day on your side after you left.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the second day of the sixteenth twelvenight of the year six gross ten dozen and four,\u201d Bakla said. \n\n\u201cAs you reckon it, yes.\u201d The voice paused a moment, then said, \u201cIt is time for us to discuss the threat to everything you know. Everything you see below you.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Rot*,\u201d Lena hissed.\n\n\u201cYes, though as near as I can tell you group several unrelated things together as \u2018rot\u2019. But they really are just normal things that happen in an `ecosystem`. All things get sick with time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sick, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a way, yes.\u201d\n\nMaltis looked up at the ceiling thoughtfully. \u201cBut puppets don\u2019t get sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am like a cart that has been used so long, a wheel has come off from wear,\u201d Elfo replied. \u201cYou see, I was created to preserve the animals, plants, and trees\u2014and to that end, I have `drones` that help with that preservation.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Dironiz*?\u201d Bakla tilted her head thoughtfully. \u201c*Donili*!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn particular, I have `repair drones`\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c*Ipeli*,\u201d Lena repeated, getting familiar with how the old words sometimes got mangled over the years. \u201cThe invisible *donili* that eat rot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose that is one way of describing them, yes. They are `nanobots`. `Drones` that are very, very small\u2014too small to see. All of `El Four`\u2014the `station`\u2014is infused with them, and they work to prevent rot. They\u2019ve been mostly successful, but to supplement their work, the first humans of `El Four` were trained on preservation techniques. That knowledge has been passed down through the Foresters and Arborists, I believe.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cIt has.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, Elfo is a `closed system`, isolated from the broader `ecosystem` of `Earth` or otherwise. Unlike on `Earth`, keeping animals, plants, and trees alive takes a great deal of effort\u2014*that* is my job.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re breaking down,\u201d Veska observed. \u201cThat\u2019s why the rot\u2019s gotten worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect. Though `El Four` was designed for long-term survival, it has been, as noted, nearly seven gross years since `commission`.\u201d\n\nLena walked up to the window and looked out at the landscape below. It was vibrant and beautiful\u2014a tree-filled land girt by sea. \u201cAnd if you break down too much\u2026\u201d Her voice was barely a whisper.\n\n\u201cIt all dies, and I become a hunk of metal in the void, as lifeless as the fallen stars you work with your hammer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Lena\u2014*your* Lena\u2014she could repair you, the way a wheelwright could repair a broken cart.\u201d She sighed. \u201c*That* is why you wanted me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re as astute as she was.\u201d\n\nShe turned back to face the inside of the flying-room. \u201cBut I\u2019m not her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can still help, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past, when there have been problems, I have been able to get in contact with `Earth`. While in general they would prefer to leave us alone, lest we be `contaminated`, they historically have lent aid and helped repair things that were broken.

I cannot send letters to `Earth` because it\u2019s broken, and I need someone to fix it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you can\u2019t send a letter to `os` to ask them to fix it.\u201d Maltis nodded in understanding.\n\nLena folded her arms in front of her chest. \u201cBut I can\u2019t fix a post office.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think you can still solve the problem. Notably, I believe that a `reboot` of the `station` would re-enable the `transmitter` and allow me to request aid from `Earth` again.

And it was beautiful, the soft color of leaves and trees instead of the harsh brightness of snow on the other side. Her heart leapt with joy to see it.\n\nMaltis groaned next to her, uncurling from her position on one of the chairs. She blinked at the sight through the window.  \u201cWhat day is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the extended `Gregorian calendar`, today is `February seventh` of the year five `thousand` four `hundred` and ten,\u201d Elfo helpfully chirped.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026not helpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cApologies. This is the day on your side after you left.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, the second day of the sixteenth twelvenight of the year six gross ten dozen and four,\u201d Bakla said. \n\n\u201cAs you reckon it, yes.\u201d The voice paused a moment, then said, \u201cIt is time for us to discuss the threat to everything you know. Everything you see below you.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Rot*,\u201d Lena hissed.\n\n\u201cYes, though as near as I can tell you group several unrelated things together as \u2018rot\u2019. But they really are just normal things that happen in an `ecosystem`. All things get sick with time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you sick, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a way, yes.\u201d\n\nMaltis looked up at the ceiling thoughtfully. \u201cBut puppets don\u2019t get sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am like a cart that has been used so long, a wheel has come off from wear,\u201d Elfo replied. \u201cYou see, I was created to preserve the animals, plants, and trees\u2014and to that end, I have `drones` that help with that preservation.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Dironiz*?\u201d Bakla tilted her head thoughtfully. \u201c*Donili*!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn particular, I have `repair drones`\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c*Ipeli*,\u201d Lena repeated, getting familiar with how the old words sometimes got mangled over the years. \u201cThe invisible *donili* that eat rot!\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose that is one way of describing them, yes. They are `nanobots`. `Drones` that are very, very small\u2014too small to see. All of `El Four`\u2014the `station`\u2014is infused with them, and they work to prevent rot. They\u2019ve been mostly successful, but to supplement their work, the first humans of `El Four` were trained on preservation techniques. That knowledge has been passed down through the Foresters and Arborists, I believe.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cIt has.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, Elfo is a `closed system`, isolated from the broader `ecosystem` of `Earth` or otherwise. Unlike on `Earth`, keeping animals, plants, and trees alive takes a great deal of effort\u2014*that* is my job.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019re breaking down,\u201d Veska observed. \u201cThat\u2019s why the rot\u2019s gotten worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorrect. Though `El Four` was designed for long-term survival, it has been, as noted, nearly seven gross years since `commission`.\u201d\n\nLena walked up to the window and looked out at the landscape below. It was vibrant and beautiful\u2014a tree-filled land girt by sea. \u201cAnd if you break down too much\u2026\u201d Her voice was barely a whisper.\n\n\u201cIt all dies, and I become a hunk of metal in the void, as lifeless as the fallen stars you work with your hammer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Lena\u2014*your* Lena\u2014she could repair you, the way a wheelwright could repair a broken cart.\u201d She sighed. \u201c*That* is why you wanted me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re as astute as she was.\u201d\n\nShe turned back to face the inside of the flying-room. \u201cBut I\u2019m not her.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can still help, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the past, when there have been problems, I have been able to get in contact with `Earth`. While in general they would prefer to leave us alone, lest we be `contaminated`, they historically have lent aid and helped repair things that were broken. However, for several gross of years, I have been\u2026unable to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Maltis asked. \u201cDid something happen to `os`?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible.

Many cultures have traditions that go back ages. They provide us with a sense of order and comfort. They help us feel closer to our roots, our families, our communities, and even our gods. How do traditions vary between the people in your worlds? Are there practices that seem strange to outsiders? How do your characters deal with their beliefs being judged or challenged?

How do traditions vary between the people in your worlds? Are there practices that seem strange to outsiders? How do your characters deal with their beliefs being judged or challenged? What would happen if someone prohibited those practices?    \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started.

For that, I apologize. But what would you have me do instead? Kill my own sister for passing judgment on the guilty?

Do you have a self-established universe you\u2019ve been writing or planning to write in? Do you have an idea for a world that\u2019s been itching to get out? This is the perfect place to explore that. Each week, I post a theme to inspire you, along with a related image and song. You have 500 - 1000 words to write your installment. You can jump in at any time; writing for previous weeks\u2019 is not necessary in order to join. After you\u2019ve posted, come back and provide feedback for at least 1 other writer on the thread. Please be sure to read the entire post for a full list of rules.\n***\n#This Week\u2019s Theme is Traditions!       \n\n[**Image**](https://www.deviantart.com/renjuart/art/Mayan-Dance-528323563)  | [**Song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E5s-KEKO3Q)            \n    \n**Bonus Word List** (each included word is worth 5 pts) - **Please list which words you included at the end of your story.**                  \n- tasty                                 \n- taboo                                                                                                           \n- transient                                                                                                                               \n- [tartle](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/tartle)          \n                                          \n         \n This week we\u2019re diving into the theme of \u2018traditions\u2019. Many cultures have traditions that go back ages. They provide us with a sense of order and comfort. They help us feel closer to our roots, our families, our communities, and even our gods. How do traditions vary between the people in your worlds? Are there practices that seem strange to outsiders? How do your characters deal with their beliefs being judged or challenged? What would happen if someone prohibited those practices?    \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n- April 28 - Traditions (this week)        \n- May 5 - Undermine    \n- May 12 - Void    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Struggle](https://new.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/sersun_serial_sunday_struggle/?sort=old)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0udn1m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel   \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l13tjke/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/mattswritingaccount                        \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0srjc6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing               \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l1hefgp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/LuminescenTT                      \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0suc6h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MaxStickies                                                                                   \n            \n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below. This feature has requirements for participation!     \n\n- **Submit a story inspired by the weekly theme, written by you and set in your *self-established* universe that is 500 - 1000 words. No fanfics and no content created or altered by AI.** (Use wordcounter.net to check your wordcount.) Stories should be posted as a top-level comment below. If you\u2019re continuing an in-progress serial (not on Serial Sunday), please include links to your previous installments. \n\n- **Your chapter must be submitted by Saturday at 9:00am EST.** Late entries will be disqualified. All submissions should be given (at least) a *basic editing pass* before being posted!\n\n- **Begin your post with the name of your serial between triangle brackets** (e.g. <My Awesome Serial>). When our bot is back up and running, this will allow it to recognize your serial and add each chapter to the SerSun catalog. Do not include anything in the brackets you don\u2019t want in your title. (Please note: You must use this same title every week.)\n\n- **Do not pre-write your serial.** You\u2019re welcome to do outlining and planning for your serial, but chapters should not be pre-written. All submissions should be written for this post, specifically.\n\n- **Only one active serial per author at a time.** This does not apply to serials written outside of Serial Sunday. \n\n- **All Serial Sunday authors must leave feedback on at least one story on the thread each week.** The feedback should be **actionable** and also include something the author has done well. When you include something the author should improve on, provide an example! You have until **Saturday at 11:59pm EST** to post your feedback. (Submitting late is not an exception to this rule.)     \n\n- **Missing your feedback requirement two or more consecutive weeks will disqualify you from rankings and Campfire readings the following week.** If it becomes a habit, you may be asked to move your serial to the sub instead.\n\n- **Serials must abide by subreddit content rules.** You can view a [full list of rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/index/rules). If you\u2019re ever unsure if your story would cross the line, please modmail and ask!\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Weekly Campfires & Voting:\n\n- **On Saturdays at 1pm EST, I host a Serial Sunday Campfire in our [Discord\u2019s Voice Lounge](https://discord.gg/writingprompts).** Join us to read your story aloud, hear others, and exchange feedback.

Though, I like to think Basil's line about her *thankfully* being clothed is just him comparing Develyn to an actual human woman, since her figure is comparable to one.\n\nThis is something I haven't really covered in my notes, mainly because discussing how food people see nudity as a concept is...obviously a little odd to write paragraphs about, but I'll give it a try.\n\n>Some indirect language here that, I think, hurts this chapter for people who haven't recently read previous ones.

Do you have a self-established universe you\u2019ve been writing or planning to write in? Do you have an idea for a world that\u2019s been itching to get out? This is the perfect place to explore that. Each week, I post a theme to inspire you, along with a related image and song. You have 500 - 1000 words to write your installment. You can jump in at any time; writing for previous weeks\u2019 is not necessary in order to join. After you\u2019ve posted, come back and provide feedback for at least 1 other writer on the thread. Please be sure to read the entire post for a full list of rules.\n***\n#This Week\u2019s Theme is Traditions!       \n\n[**Image**](https://www.deviantart.com/renjuart/art/Mayan-Dance-528323563)  | [**Song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E5s-KEKO3Q)            \n    \n**Bonus Word List** (each included word is worth 5 pts) - **Please list which words you included at the end of your story.**                  \n- tasty                                 \n- taboo                                                                                                           \n- transient                                                                                                                               \n- [tartle](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/tartle)          \n                                          \n         \n This week we\u2019re diving into the theme of \u2018traditions\u2019. Many cultures have traditions that go back ages. They provide us with a sense of order and comfort. They help us feel closer to our roots, our families, our communities, and even our gods. How do traditions vary between the people in your worlds? Are there practices that seem strange to outsiders? How do your characters deal with their beliefs being judged or challenged? What would happen if someone prohibited those practices?    \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n- April 28 - Traditions (this week)        \n- May 5 - Undermine    \n- May 12 - Void    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Struggle](https://new.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/sersun_serial_sunday_struggle/?sort=old)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0udn1m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel   \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l13tjke/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/mattswritingaccount                        \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0srjc6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing               \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l1hefgp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/LuminescenTT                      \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cal71y/comment/l0suc6h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MaxStickies                                                                                   \n            \n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below.

A thick tarp stretched over the top of the tent to take most of the heat, leaving the rest of it in the shade.  A thinner fabric for the inner tent to let a breeze through, and something to cover her eyes for darkness.\n\nThe soup Kher served had been tasty, but very spicy.  Cass thought it would keep her up all day with the fire in her mouth.  Instead, it made her sweat more than usual, cooling her a bit and she all but passed out within minutes of laying down.  She did wake up a few times through the day to shift uncomfortably in the heat but was never up for long.  Until someone spoke and woke her with a start.\n\n\"Huh?\" she grunted as she jerked up from the soft floor of the tent.  Cass didn't remember getting out of bed but wasn't surprised.  The ground was cooler.\n\n\"I said, 'It's dangerous to sleep naked on the floor.',\" the woman repeated herself.  Cass tartled for a moment before her name came to mind.\n\n\"G'morning to you too, Mica,\" she grumbled, grabbing the edge of her bed for balance to stand up.\n\n\"Scorpions and spiders get in,\" Mica continued, \"you're rolling the dice if you keep doing this.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"  Cass shrugged as she sat on the bed.  She grabbed some linen strips to wrap up her arm, yawned, and asked, \"Is it time for us to get up?\"\n\n\"Two hours until sundown,\" Mica confirmed with a nod.  \"Can you still fight with that?\" She was staring at the blackened, emaciated limb.  It was an odd subject for Cass to expound with Disciples; to her, it was merely a daily fact of life, hardly taboo, but curses were the sort of thing they liked to \"burn\" away - often literally.\n\n\"How about you go out and get Iuven ready and I'll worry about me?\"\n\nMica left with a shrug and Cass finished getting dressed.  A light robe over breezy clothes to keep the sun off of her and some extra wraps around her legs to help keep sand from being abrasive in her sandals.  It would be hot once she got moving in the sun, but she could always take them off once they were riding again.\n\n\"-and then I said that's not my dog, that's a rat!\" Glaukos was telling a joke to Kher by the fire when Cass emerged from her tent.  She quickly scanned the transient camp for everyone and spotted Iuven and Mica atop a dune and geared for a fight.  The young man waved his helm at her and she waved back.  Pulling her hood up to keep the sun out of her face as she approached Cass grabbed her swordspear from the water cart and climbed the dune.\n\n\"Before we start,\" Mica said, holding out her hand.  Cass knew she wanted to try the weapon herself and chuckled.  She held it out with one hand and dropped it in Mica's, only for her to drop it immediately.  Iuven grabbed the solid metal handle in both hands and lifted it, lurching slightly as he underestimated the weight.\n\n\"You weren't kidding,\" he said as he handed the weapon to Mica who strained with the weight before giving it back to Cass. \n\nHolding it at the center of mass - a pair of handspans below the hilt of the blade, more than a few away from the apparent center - Cass twirled it around the fingers of her left hand as though it weighed next to nothing.\n\n\"Still want to fight?\" She walked down the dune away from camp.  Iuven picked up his spear and shield.  Mica drew a sword.  \"Alright.  The only rule I have is no hitting this arm.\"  She tapped her left arm, wrapped in bandages.  \"Anything else goes.  Don't worry about hurting me, just try your-\"\n\n\"Point.\"  The tip of Mica's sword was up under Cass's right armpit.\n\n\"Hey, we didn't-\"\n\n\"Haha, point!\"  Iuven followed Mica's lead, touching the point of his spear into Cass's side.\n\n\"Fuck it,\" Cass said, gripping her weapon and shoving the blunt counterweight into Iuven's shield.  She was as careful as she could be without giving him much time to react, trying to hold back from breaking his arm.  Knocking him off balance was the goal.  Mica didn't have a shield to protect her so Cass needed a different tactic.\n\nThe small woman lunged forward and got Cass in the back.  Mica was gone by the time she spun around.  Cass looked back at Iuven just in time to see him throw his spear.  She ducked under it only to feel someone tackle her at the knees and leave her laying in the sand.  Mica stood up over her and tapped her on the stomach with her sword.\n\n\"Point.\"  She frowned down at Cass.  \"You know I thought it'd be harder to knock you down.\"\n\n\"In my defense, I'm not used to *not* killing when I fight,\" Cass grumbled as she stood up, brushing sand off of her clothes.\n\n\"Hardly an excuse.\"  Mica switched her sword to her off-hand and held the other behind her back.  \"I think you rely on your strength too much.\"  She stepped forward and stabbed.

Not made of metal and architecture, but of composed and compacted garbage, cuboid and crushed plastic, bones and charred remains. Radioactive materials, and huge mangled constructions left in limbo from failed venture capitals.\n\nFrom afar, the gigantic mound looked like the striations of a mountainside, like an earthquakes aftermath. Abandoned and decayed, where the atmosphere had turned toxic.\n\nThe sun gazed down, obscured, as swirls of noxious clouds smeared across drifting currents. \n\nA scar ran through the city of filth. Once a river with clear water, it was now low and filled with so much plastic and recyclables, that Colin was despondently amazed it still flowed at all.\n\nThe air was dry and dusty. The putrid smells would be intolerable, but his mask thankfully, was impervious to the stench. He peered about, taking in the misery and ruin.\n\nThere.\n\nA large ratted thing. With patchy dying fur, double feet, half a second mouth, eyelidless eyes along its backside, and twin nail sharp tails, twitching.\n\nIt was the first sign of life he'd seen come from the eastern heaps of wastedump. It, being this close to the bunker was a threat to everyone's safety.\n\nThe ratted screed again with an anguished cry like scraping steel.\n\nColin winced. Annoyed now, he went to close the hatch, and the thing alerted to the slight movement scurried away. \n\nCursing, he went below to get his ramshackled armor and a gun. \n\nIt was time to go hunting.\n\n(300 words, another dystopic one, critiques welcome!)", "reply_created_utc": 1714504493.0}]}

Hands outstretched, and feet probing, I pressed forward in search of the broken pipe I had been sent to fix.  Sixty feet above me the February sun danced brightly across the water\u2019s rippled surface, but far below, icy streams worked their way into the edges of my wet suit and clouds of swirling silt blotted out any hope of light from above.  The darkness was absolute.  With every step I took my steel toed boots sank deeply into the glue like mud.  The thick rubber and lead weight belt slid low on my hips, while the harness that held my emergency air and an array of wrenches, along with a knife, bit into my werry shoulders.  The worn umbilical that trailed limply behind my helmet brought me air and let my speak to the surface, but it also added to my burden with every foot that played out.

Now the sound of chattering teeth reverberated inside my steel dive helmet with increasing frequency. \n\nI was daydreaming when I felt them attack, wrapping first around my leg and then my stomach.  Long strands in the blackness.  Tendrils that snaked themselves over my body.  Out of instinct I turned away, but this only helped my attacker tighten its grip.  My arms were pinned to my chest, as the thing enclosed itself around me.  Spinning wildly about, my heart hammered against my ribs as I desperately trying to free myself.  My toe hooked on my heel and that was all the current needed to topple me.   I hit the ground with a thud, completely ensnared.  Fighting in a literal sea of darkness, on the ragged edge of complete panic, I managed to grab part of the malicious web and yank with all my might.  When I pulled in one direction they tightened in another, The ferocity of their attack mirroring my own increasing struggle to escape.  Then, just when it seemed I must surely be eaten at any moment, a ray of clarity somehow shined through.  Chafing against my numb hand I could feel rough fibers and tight braid.  This was not some ancient monster or vengeful drowned spirit, but discarded tangle of rope.  Carelessly tossed overboard by a fisherman or blown to sea in a storm.

My lungs were frozen and I was trapped on the seafloor, suffocating.  I tried to cry out for help through the intercom, but could not muster the force to make my vocal cords function.  The air, that paltry amount trapped in my helmet, smelled stale.  It could only mean one thing, my surface supply had been cut off and the tight seal around the helmet kept me from even attempting to breath.  I thrust up with my hand to reach the valve on the helmet\u2019s side that would turn on the backup air.  After only a few inches the lines bit hard and arrested any further movement.  I could feel the bottom edge of the helmet.  I knew that my backup bottle, the air I needed to call for help, that would give me time to figure things out, that would save my life was there waiting, just beyond my finger tips.  Fire spread through my lungs and a dense fog crept into my brain.  My heart was thundering again.  In an act of pure futility I looked around, but could not even see the piece of tempered glass at the end of my nose.

The ambush by the drifting line had frightened me and sent my thoughts down a twisting course.  But now what I needed to do was clear.  We all kept our knives in the same place so that they could be easily found at time such as these, and with some creative wiggling I was able to grasp its bulky snap shackle without searching.  Forcing myself to not rush and drop the knife, I unclipped it from my harness and pushed my thumb into the oversized hole on its spine.  With a flick I let lose four inches of wickedly aggressive serration, and began sawing at the nearest section of line.  The knife tore swiftly through the rotting fibers, and my other hand slid up an inch as the trap loosened.  I located a wrap higher up my body and with two hurried slashes the rope separated.  As the pain in my lungs became unbearable and I felt myself slipping into unconsciousness, my arm burst free.  With well practiced motions,  I turned the valve open until it could go no further and fished around for the tank\u2019s pressure gauge.

Orin Zack\n\n[2003]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChapter Sixteen\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cHave you got it?\u201d Mara said apprehensively when Angela joined her outside the courtroom.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d The Australian smiled conspiratorially and opened her hand, revealing the shiny device that had been knocked from their adversary\u2019s grip. She nudged it with her thumb to examine the bisected sunrise design engraved on its face, and then tucked it away in her pack. \u201cGreat suggestion, by the way. Ever considered taking up subversion as a hobby?\u201d\n\nMara laughed grimly. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think I already have. If killing Uru G\u2019danic is part of the GD\u2019s peacekeeping strategy, then mediating conflicts at the Indigenous People\u2019s Coalition might actually qualify.\u201d\n\nAngela looked around at the milling crowd, and then nodded towards the stairs. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I don\u2019t know how much time we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nKeeping pace, Mara glanced at her. \u201cTime for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo have a word with that bastard.\u201d A few steps later, she added, \u201cIn private.\u201d\n\nMara slowed slightly. \u201cBut how? The detention room must be locked now. Wouldn\u2019t the biometrics keep you out?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would, except that I asked Lenny to add me to the access list this morning.\u201d She picked up the pace, and started down the stairs. \u201cCall it a hunch, like knowing when to change lanes in traffic. I\u2019ll have to thank Frank for introducing us.\u201d\n\nSince there were several people in the detention hallway when they arrived, Angela slowed to a casual stroll and Mara followed suit.\n\nAs they reached the first room, Mara stopped and glanced at the other two doors. \u201cWhich one is he in, and which one has Alex?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince they\u2019re shielded,\u201d Angela said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell from out here, so we\u2019ll just have to open them and see.\u201d She grabbed the handle and pushed, but it didn\u2019t move. \u201cThat answers one question. Since it\u2019s locked, one of them is in here.\u201d She pulled an ID out of her pack and slid it past the reader. \u201cPhony, of course, but it matches my biometrics, in a round-about sort of way.\u201d Then, she showed the laser target her right eye, and a soft tone sounded. \u201cIf anyone comes along,\u201d she said, grabbing the handle, \u201cmake sure they go away.\u201d\n\nIn one smooth motion, she pushed the door open, stepped inside, and closed it behind her. \u201cRemember me?\u201d she said to their adversary, who was facing a map of MexAmerica on the far wall.\n\n\u201cHealer Pascoe,\u201d he said, turning towards her. \u201cOr should I say, Angela. After all, you can\u2019t practice any\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, you son of a bitch,\u201d she shouted, stepping closer. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is now,\u201d he said ominously.\n\n\u201cJust who the hell are you, anyway?\u201d\n\nHe smiled, and in so doing made it all the more obvious just how young he really was. She judged him to be in his early twenties, twenty-four at most, but with a swaggering sense of power that should have been unnatural for someone even twice his age. He was dressed in that nether region separating casual and professional, with just enough flash to fit into either group, but not enough believability to stay there very long.\n\nWhen he didn\u2019t answer, she reached in her pack and slammed the small device onto the table separating them. \u201cAnd what\u2019s this?\u201d\n\nHe started to lunge towards it, so she snapped it up and held it in her fist. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this thing is, or how it works, but Frank and I both saw you using it in Apu\u00e9rto\u2019s memory. And I think you were about to use it a few minutes ago in court.\u201d\n\nHe stared at her fist, as she shook it in the air at him.\n\n\u201cWhat does it do? What happens when you go translucent?\u201d\n\nStill nothing.\n\nShe folded her arms. \u201cAnd what do murder, manipulating healthcare and character assassination have to do with the GD peacekeepers, if that\u2019s who you really work for?\u201d\n\nHe snorted. \u201cWhat rock have you been hiding under, anyway? Did you think the human race hasn\u2019t destroyed itself for the past century out of courtesy or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a glacier, not a rock, you self-important slug,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cMaking that ice cave appear under Franz Joseph last year was your doing, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHe nodded stiffly. \u201cAn unavoidable side-effect that I\u2019ve regretted ever since, if you really must know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d she said, pleased at being vindicated, \u201cthat whatever you people are doing is far from perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d he said, \u201cand you\u2019ve never made a mistake? Just who the hell do you think you are to be challenging me like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here to find out. Now tell me your name!\u201d\n\nHe just stared at her.\n\n\u201cA name,\u201d she said stolidly. \u201cI want your name, or I walk out of here and hand this thing to the media.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cRight. And what are you going to tell them? That it\u2019s the ultimate weapon? That it can make people invisible so they can spy at meetings?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cI\u2019ll tell them that you can use it to warp events any way you want, that you can cause impossible accidents, change reality. Things like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you expect them to believe you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will,\u201d she whispered, \u201conce I\u2019ve showed them.\u201d\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cNot likely. It\u2019s keyed to my DNA.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cThanks for the tip. Now what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cVacca,\u201d he said, with a cocky nod, \u201cErnie Vacca.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. Now sit.\u201d\n\nHe sat. \u201cOkay. Now what?\u201d\n\nShe held up the gadget again. \u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called a Synergizer. Sort of a cross between a psychic shield and a destabilizer, if that means anything to you.\u201d\n\nShe tapped the symbol etched into it. \u201cAnd this? What does it mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said, irritably, \u201cif you want to play show-and-tell, I\u2019m really not interested.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe symbol?\u201d she repeated, forcefully.\n\nVacca shook his head. \u201cIf you knew half as much about symbols as you did about creating false identities, you\u2019d realize that it means transcendence in half-a-dozen cultures.\u201d\n\nShe turned it to face her. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty strange sentiment for a group that goes around killing people, unless of course you meant it to represent the journey you\u2019ve forced people like Uru G\u2019danic and Vern Cuoku to take.\u201d\n\nHe huffed. \u201cCome on, Angela. Neither of them were my doing.\u201d\n\nShe looked him in the eye. \u201cAn associate then? One of the other members of\u2026 what is this so-called peacekeeping organization called, anyway?\u201d\n\nBefore Vacca had a chance to answer, Frank threw the door open.\n\n\u201cBut who\u2019s Lenny?\u201d Mara uselessly asked the air as he passed by.\n\nWhen Angela saw Ernie suddenly look up, she turned around and rose from her seat. \u201cFrank, stop!\u201d she yelled, both hands raised in protest.\n\nSeeing the gadget, Frank grabbed it from her and buried it in his fist.\n\nBehind him, Mara stepped in, slammed the door, and glanced quickly at each in turn, sizing up the situation.\n\nVacca looked at Frank doubtfully. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing with that?\u201d\n\nFrank sneered back. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this thing is, you asshole, but if you don\u2019t tell me what you did to Jerry Suus, I swear I\u2019ll beat you to death with it!\u201d\n\n\u201cFrank!\u201d Mara yelled sharply. When he turned to look at her, she continued in a strong but even voice. \u201cYou won\u2019t get any answers from a dead man.\u201d\n\nAngela pried his hand open. \u201cGive me that thing, Frank. Vacca here says it\u2019s keyed to his DNA.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her, then at the man sitting across the table. \u201cSo you have a name. Great. Now tell me what that thing is.\u201d\n\nVacca shook his head in amusement. \u201cAs I was just telling Angela here, it\u2019s a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAngela?\u201d Frank and Mara said at once.\n\nShe frowned. \u201cLater.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Vacca continued, \u201cit\u2019s a synergizer, not that it\u2019ll mean anything to you.\u201d He rubbed his neck briefly. \u201cListen, do you think you can sit down?  I\u2019m getting a stiff neck looking up at all of you.\u201d\n\nReluctantly, Frank joined Angela at the table. Mara joined them a moment later.\n\n\u201cNow, then,\u201d Angela said, \u201cwe want some answers. A lot of pretty nasty things have been going on, and not just here in Los Angeles, from what Mara told me. The thing is, for some reason, they all seem to involve you, or at least this GD peacekeeping agency you supposedly work for. What are you after, anyway?\u201d\n\nVacca smiled, if that\u2019s what you could call it. \u201cPeace.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Frank snarled. \u201cYou certainly have a funny way of going about it: killing people, arranging accidents, messing with people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cMessing with causality,\u201d Angela added, \u201ccharacter assassination, wiping people\u2019s memories. Should I go on?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d Vacca protested. \u201cThe world is a very complicated place. If we didn\u2019t proactively manage conflict, the world would have blown itself up years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cConflict management?\u201d Mara said suddenly. \u201cIs that what this is about?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Vacca said calmly. \u201cWhy do you think there hasn\u2019t been a real war in a hundred years? The com channel subliminals reduce the need to intervene, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Yeah. I\u2019ve heard your so-called voice of reason.\u201d Angela said. \u201cA former co-worker of yours tells me that they originate in an office block right here in L.A.\u201d\n\nVacca flinched. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I haven\u2019t,\u201d Frank said suddenly. \u201cWhat do they say?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing harmful,\u201d Vacca said uneasily, still watching Angela. \u201cThey remind people to follow the rules, and tells them that they are safe and secure. It\u2019s just good PR, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nFrank struck the table. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of this bullshit. What do conflict management and subliminal PR have to do with murdering mathematicians like Vern Cuoku? Or with whatever it was that you did to Jerry Suus?\u201d\n\nMara snorted. \u201cOr with making sure that Uru G\u2019danic never gets a chance to finish what he\u2019s started, bringing the world\u2019s aboriginal peoples together in common cause?\u201d\n\nVacca took a long breath. \u201cI told you already. It\u2019s all about keeping the peace. And even with the subliminals, we still need information about what certain individuals and groups are planning. There are too many people on this planet to keep track of all of them. So we hire outside help, people like Korn and Guti\u00e9rez\u2014\u201d\n\nFrank snorted. \u201cYeah. And I suppose you have them all convinced that spying on patients, breaking the Healer\u2019s Oath, is a noble act?\u201d\n\n\u201cCut the crap, Frank.\u201d Vacca shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve done far worse during your short time on that jury, and I\u2019m sure you used the same rationale, that it\u2019s for a higher purpose.\u201d\n\nFrank frowned, stinging from the sudden pain of forced introspection.\n\n\u201cSo, yeah,\u201d Vacca continued, \u201cwe use people like Carlita Guti\u00e9rez, to gather intelligence from individuals we arrange for them to see. And we need people like Allan Wylie to manage them.\u201d\n\nAngela shook her head in disgust. \u201cWhat a crock! So when some of these people you suspect of whatever you want to charge them with get offended by having to shell out more for their healthcare, and draw a suit against some of the businesses you make use of, it threatens to blow the cover off your twisted little scheme, and you panic.\u201d\n\nVacca rose out of his seat. \u201cAll of those people, and a lot of others, threaten the peace because of the ideas they spread, or because of the movements they support.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a break, Vacca.\u201d Frank said. \u201cWhat kind of paranoid fantasy do you people live in anyway? How can a mathematician possibly threaten the peace?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, you self-righteous jerk,\u201d he said, leaning over the table on his outstretched hands. \u201cI neither know nor care. All we do is watch for conflict, and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nFrank held the gadget up and shook his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s what this thing\u2019s for, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nVacca straightened and crossed his arms. \u201cYes. The synergizer lets us see into the TimeStream, to spot signs of impending conflict, and gives us a way to encourage the events that avoid those conflicts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I suppose,\u201d Mara said gently, \u201cthat it also enables you to encourage events that eliminate the people causing those alleged conflicts. People like Uru G\u2019danic.\u201d\n\nVacca just stared at her.\n\n\u201cAnd the people who threaten to expose you.\u201d Mara said. \u201cLike Alex and me. Like Jerry Suus.\u201d\n\nAngela snorted. \u201cEven former employees it seems.\u201d\n\nHe looked down at his hands, now splayed in front of him. \u201cWhat was done to your friend Jerry shouldn\u2019t have been necessary. The idea is to not be noticed. It\u2019s just that he\u2019d managed to snag a loose end.\u201d\n\n\u201cA loose end?\u201d Frank echoed incredulously. \u201cGreat. I\u2019m sure Jen will be thrilled to learn that her cousin Vern was nothing but a loose end to you people.\u201d\n\nAngela glanced the others. \u201cFor that matter, I suppose you\u2019re going to have to shut all of us up, too?\u201d\n\nFrank laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too late for that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Then he turned towards Vacca. \u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d\n\nVacca shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything.\u201d He stared at Frank for a moment. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019ve trapped me here just means that we\u2019re all now part of a potential conflict that\u2019ll have to be detoured. I know what you\u2019re thinking, and it won\u2019t help. Impending conflicts are easy to spot. With the synergizer, they look like a standing wave in front of a boulder in a stream. So don\u2019t spend any time worrying about it. This \u2018situation\u2019 is already being taken care of.\u201d He casually gestured at the gadget on the table. \u201cA friend of mine, the agent who dealt with G\u2019danic and Cuoku, is watching the patterns we\u2019re making in the TimeStream right now. And when he\u2019s ready, he\u2019ll use his synergizer to make sure it doesn\u2019t come to anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like that, huh?\u201d Mara sighed. \u201cAnd I suppose it doesn\u2019t bother you to know what you\u2019ve destroyed, to know how important G\u2019danic\u2019s work really was, or how his vision of the future could have made your absurd methods unnecessary.\u201d\n\nVacca didn\u2019t answer immediately. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that bothers me,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI do think about that. I wonder what we\u2019ve traded off these past hundred years in the name of peace.\u201d\n\nAngela leaned towards him. \u201cThen do something about it. You\u2019re inside the agency. Take advantage of that position and see what you can do.\u201d\n\nHe laughed weakly. \u201cSure, like what Jerry Suus wanted that juror to do on this case? Don\u2019t you see? The technology makes it a self-correcting system. If anyone gets out of line and tries to make trouble, the others will see it coming and head it off.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike,\u201d Frank said, with dark amusement, \u201cputting humanity on BioStabilization, and keeping some imaginary \u2018peace organ\u2019 in its happy little, deady dull attractor. Sure it\u2019s peaceful, but it is still alive? Is it worth it?\u201d\n\nThey were all silent for a time, none of them sure of what to say or why. Then, Vacca slid his chair back and stood up to stretch. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he said at last, there\u2019s one bit of this that escapes me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Frank said.\n\n\u201cYeah. Who was that guy that decked me in the courtroom? I didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d\n\nMara smiled. \u201cMy brother Alex. He has a talent for dancing out of people\u2019s way, then hitting them from out of nowhere. That\u2019s why he started a publishing company.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my,\u201d Frank said suddenly. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we see about getting him out of lockup?\u201d\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2026 Friday \u2026\n\nGetting back into the patterns of life, or of work, after a disruption as severe as the one that Frank had just been through always took a while. He\u2019d gone into hiding, in a manner of speaking, since being released from duty at the courthouse on Monday. Everyone at K\u00fcbler-Ross Hospice Center was aware of the need for people with the heightened sensitivities required to be a Healer to free themselves of inner conflicts over their abilities, or about the value of what they did to help their patients. They knew that the pressure placed on Frank by the court, and the unwanted attention given him by the press would have lasting effects. Except for Jen, however, none of them really understood the toll it had taken on his sense of self-worth.\n\nHe\u2019d asked for time to recover, for an open-ended leave-of-absence, and was supported in every way by the entire team. He\u2019d stayed home the past few days to decompress, but today he had come to K\u00fcbler-Ross to clean up his office, to make certain that all of his patients were properly handed off to co-workers, and to say goodbye to some of the staff, at least for now, in person.\n\nFrank put the report he was reviewing away, and stopped to stare out the window. One person he wouldn\u2019t be seeing was Carlita Guti\u00e9rez. In the flurry of revelations that erupted after Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir\u2019s testimony that day, a number of people at Hospice Centers, MedCenters and Insurance offices worldwide were implicated in a far-ranging scheme that not only benefited both corporations named in the suit, but indirectly threatened the integrity of the jurisdictional rulings, and prevented an unknown number of people from getting the kinds of timely healthcare for which they had registered their preferences in the global MedNet. Carlita was implicated in a pattern of patient misdirection that had begun years earlier in Mexico City. While she retained a license to practice, she was prohibited from working in any Hospice having a patient-transfer relationship with any MedCenter operated by HealthTech Resources. Consequently, she had elected to leave Los Angeles, and refused to disclose her destination.\n\nJen, having put her suspicions about what had happened to her cousin Vern to rest, was happily back in the flow of ensuring that life went smoothly at K\u00fcbler-Ross. When the data auditors at BlackBox recovered the missing incident report, she was satisfied that the flight her cousin had been on really did have an accident.\n\nThe insistent attention tone broke into Frank\u2019s reverie. He blinked a few times, and then looked down at the familiar face on his display. \u201cYeah, Jen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you wanted to be left alone, Frank, but you have a visitor.\u201d\n\nFrank hesitated upon stepping into the lobby, for Administrator Apu\u00e9rto was standing near the information counter, admiring one of the free-form sculptures. He wasn\u2019t entirely certain how the man felt about him, considering all that had happened since Frank had attempted to examine Jerry at the MedCenter.\n\nAt Frank\u2019s approach, Apu\u00e9rto nodded, and waited for him to make the first move.\n\n\u201cJoin me for some coffee?\u201d Frank said uneasily, concerned about whether the man\u2019s unexpected visit was a prelude to some delayed retaliation for having kidnapped him and placed him in danger. On the way down the main hallway towards the break room, he added, \u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Apu\u00e9rto said, \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to thank you for helping to expose the problems in our process. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of how much value we place on\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Frank said, stepping to the break room, \u201cbut I stopped following the case when the jury released me from duty. How did it turn out?\u201d\n\nThey got drinks and sat at one of the tables.\n\n\u201cOkay, I suppose,\u201d Apu\u00e9rto said as he stirred in some milk, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never been too clear on how these metasystem problems occur. After all, if you examine each of the processes on their own, they work perfectly fine. Yet, when you let them interact, when you have the solid processes developed for MedCenters, Insurance carriers and Hospices bump up against one another, all hell breaks loose.\u201d He took a sip. \u201cSpeaking of which, how\u2019s your neural problem doing?\u201d\n\nFrank grimaced. \u201cWhen I realized that the experimental energy sprite wasn\u2019t working properly, I had it removed, but then you probably know about that since it happened in the middle of testimony.\u201d\n\nApu\u00e9rto nodded. \u201cSo, what are you going to do? Try another sprite?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. The Healer that set it up for me isn\u2019t here any longer. She was one of the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. She was in court that day, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nFrank nodded. \u201cI\u2019d already left by then, so I don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was odd, really.\u201d Apu\u00e9rto paused in thought. \u201cOne of the other people in court, the man sitting beside her, as I recall, actually implicated her.\u201d\n\nWylie, Frank thought.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those bizarre outbursts that got so overused in the early potboilers. Anyway, I had a thought. I\u2019d like to offer our services, to help find a solution to your problem.\u201d\n\nFrank sat back.\n\n\u201cI know that gentech treatments are pretty expensive, but my staff tell me they have an idea that might work, and I\u2019d like to give them a chance to find out.\u201d\n\nFrank took a drink.\n\nApu\u00e9rto frowned. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re willing, of course. Oh, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s on the house, at no cost to you. My way of saying thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though I put you in danger?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd saved my life.\u201d The administrator looked around for a moment. \u201cOh, there\u2019s one more thing. I brought this...\u201d He fished in his pocket, and pulled out a sheet of digital paper, one of the flexiforms that circulated along with MedCenter patients. \u201cIt\u2019s a transfer order. I think you know the man. We wanted to know if your staff could do anything beyond what we were able to.\u201d\n\nFrank read it twice before looking up. The name on the form was Jeraboam Suus.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cSo, this is Pegwin,\u201d Angela, said, while beeping the baby\u2019s nose.\n\nMara adjusted her grip on Peg. \u201cHi Cynthia, Lenny. We just finished dinner, but you\u2019re both welcome to join us for dessert. We\u2019re  having a minor celebration tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo shopping, did you?\u201d Frank asked, indicating the first non-drab outfit he\u2019d seen her in since they\u2019d met. \u201cBy the way, would you prefer Cynthia or Angela.\n\n\u201cAngela. Yeah, well, after what we found out on Monday, there didn\u2019t seem to be much point in staying quite that far underground. Besides, I\u2019ve been thinking about heading back to Canberra, and wanted something nice to wear when I show Lenny around Parliament House.\u201d\n\nMara smiled. \u201cDoes that mean you two are thinking about having a relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Lenny laughed, \u201cwe already have one. And after talking about it, we also realized that our talents complemented one another nicely, too. So we\u2019re going to play tourist for a while just to get the feel of not being a solo act anymore, and we\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSolo act?\u201d Frank said. \u201cI thought you worked with those people I ran into outside the courthouse. Like that woman who smashed my glasses?\u201d\n\n\u201cVanessa?\u201d Lenny shook his head. \u201cI guess you could call her a day-worker. If you walk into any town and stir up some trouble, you\u2019ll have at least a few random helpers for a day or two. They come and go, but you rarely see any of them a second time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubliminals, no doubt,\u201d Mara noted.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Lenny said. \u201cI think they moved it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater, lover,\u201d Angela said. Then, looking at Frank, she added, \u201cSo what\u2019s the celebration?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo things really. I officially went on leave this afternoon, and Mara comes off hers on Monday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Mara said happily. \u201cAfter what happened this week at the Aboriginal Nations Summit, the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Angela said suddenly. \u201cThat was this week, wasn\u2019t it. How did they handle Uru G\u2019danic\u2019s death?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot well,\u201d Frank said, \u201cfrom what Alex tells us. He flew back to Halifax as soon as we got him released from temporary custody at the courthouse. There was a lot of low-level bickering among the delegates, what with the loss of G\u2019danic\u2019s insights and all, but at least the organization survived.\u201d\n\nLenny frowned at the interruption. \u201cYou were saying, Mara?\u201d\n\nShe nodded graciously. \u201cHave you ever considered taking up facilitating?\u201d\n\n\u201cI already do,\u201d he laughed, \u201cjust in another context. You were saying\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Coalition is one of the bodies that supports the ANO. In fact, we\u2019d been instrumental in having created that organization in the first place. Anyway, what we do is help the various groups to work together on outside projects, but to do that, they have to be able to not only understand one another, but to think like one another. G\u2019danic\u2019s work was similar, but on a different scale. In his absence, though, we\u2019re the means to the ends he\u2019d spoken about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd written about,\u201d Frank added sadly. \u201cBut now nobody will ever read it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Mara said, \u201cbefore this gets me too melancholy, I\u2019m going to get us all some cake.\u201d She handed Peg to Frank.\n\nAs she rose to leave, Angela turned towards Frank, who was busy cuddling Peg. \u201cMara mentioned that. Wasn\u2019t Alex planning to publish G\u2019danic\u2019s book?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was, but with all of the files gone, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe discussion dead-ended at that point until Mara returned with four slices of chocolate raspberry cake with mol\u00e9 icing. After an impromptu salute to the future over raised forks, they shared a modern reflection of an ancient religious rite, and didn\u2019t dilute the full effect of chocolate with idle chatter.\n\nLenny was the first to break the pleasant silence that followed. \u201cI just had a thought. I heard that the files were destroyed, as well as any supporting materials, but has anyone read a reasonably complete draft of this guy\u2019s book?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Mara said. \u201cAlex said that he did. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m no psychic,\u201d Lenny said uneasily, \u201cand I\u2019m not too clear on how you do these things, but there\u2019s been a lot in the news this week about why the courts use psychics to monitor testimony. The thing that caught my interest was the idea that you could actually pick out more detail from a witness\u2019 memories than the witness might be able to recall. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2026\u201d\n\nAngela picked up the slack. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Lenny said, \u201cif that\u2019s so, then wouldn\u2019t you be able to just extract a copy of it from Alex\u2019s memory?\u201d\n\nFrank sat back. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting idea, but it\u2019s just not that simple. There are all kinds of memories: sounds, sights, smells, even thoughts and emotions. It\u2019s tricky enough to pull the details from those sorts of memories. But to get an entire book?\u201d\n\nAngela held up a hand. \u201cWait a bit.\u201d She looked at Lenny briefly. \u201cHe might be onto something here. What if you put Alex into a light trance, and had him remember reading the book.\u201d She turned towards Frank. \u201cThen, if you were linked to him, and had a voice-rec unit handy, you could read it aloud and have the thing transcribed. It might work.\u201d\n\nFrank looked at her doubtfully.\n\n\u201cWhat can you lose? The worst that can happen is that it doesn\u2019t work, and you don\u2019t have a copy of a book that\u2019s already lost.\u201d After a pause, she added, \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t have another attack in the midst of it, anyway. What are you going to do about that neural problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really want to take him up on his offer, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOffer?\u201d Mara said.\n\n\u201cYeah. When Apu\u00e9rto came over to the Hospice today with Jerry\u2019s transfer order, he also offered to have his gentech staff work up a solution to this thing. He said it would be on the house, in thanks for saving his life and all. It\u2019s just that MedCenters are so uncomfortable to be in, and I\u2019d have to go there a number of times.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop whining, Frank,\u201d Angela scolded him. \u201cI think this is a bit more important than your being uncomfortable for a while. Think about what it means to Mara, what it means to Alex. Heck, think what it might mean for the whole world.\u201d\n\nFrank looked at the floor. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLenny,\u201d she said, \u201cI think we\u2019d best leave these two to talk it over.\u201d\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2026 A few weeks later \u2026\n\nAlex LeBlanc returned to Los Angeles on the strength of a cryptic request from his sister. She\u2019d told him only that it had to do with a new book that she thought he might be interested in publishing. Needing a break after the depressing time he\u2019d spent at the Summit, he took the first sub-orbital flight out, and on a reputable carrier.\n\nNeither Mara nor Frank said a word about it on their way back from Columbia Spaceport, and continued to keep him in the dark through dinner as well. Finally, halfway through dessert, Alex finally broke.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand this any longer, sis,\u201d he said, waving his fork at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the secret? What\u2019s the book? Who\u2019s the author? When do we meet?\u201d\n\nMara laughed. \u201cYou already know all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nFrank pointed at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve already read it, anyway.\u201d\n\nAlex jabbed his fork into the remains of his cake, and left it standing there like Excalibur before Arthur happened by. \u201cAre you going to tell me what this is about, or am I going to have to hold your daughter for ransom?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Frank said, hands raised. \u201cI think it\u2019s called \u2018Becoming Contextual,\u2019 or something like that.\u201d\n\nAlex stared at him. \u201cG\u2019danic\u2019s book? But there\u2019s not a shred left of it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think there is,\u201d Mara said. \u201cNow finish your dessert.\u201d\n\nWith his mouth full of cake, Alex pointed to his empty plate. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, almost unintelligibly, \u201cWhere\u2019s the book?\u201d\n\nMara reached towards him and tapped his head. \u201cIn there.\u201d\n\nHe struggled to swallow the cake. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said you\u2019d read it.\u201d\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cSo what? It\u2019s not like I have a photographic memory or something.\u201d\n\nFrank smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s still in there. Some friends of ours suggested that I link with you, and read it into a voicerec unit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Alex sat back, blinked a few times, and then dropped his jaw.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLater that evening, with the gentle sound of Mara\u2019s favorite acoustic artist at the fringe of audibility, Frank helped Alex into a light trance.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI want to you remember the day you sat down to read G\u2019danic\u2019s manuscript. Put all of the distractions of that day away, and focus only on the book. You\u2019ve got the title page in front of you, and there\u2019s nothing else in the world more important than reading this book. Stay there while I link in, and then we can read it together.\u201d\n\nFrank had been to East-Side MedCenter a half dozen times over the past few weeks, enduring its psychic maelstrom during the lengthy process of setting up and tuning the gentech meds. His initial visit had been the worst, and not just because of the samples and tests they needed. Worse than that was the occasional unplanned glimpse into the anguish broadcast by some of the patients.\n\nThe MedCenter team finished their work a few days earlier, and Mara called Alex soon after that. This would be Frank\u2019s first deep link with the gentech in his system, and he wasn\u2019t too thrilled with the possibility of learning how well it worked with Mara\u2019s brother at risk. But since they were both willing to take the risk, he closed his eyes, slowed his breath, and reached into Alex\u2019s mind.\n\nThe first thing he noticed was that it was more difficult to synch properly with the memory substrate. Assuming that it was simply a matter of acclimatizing to the subtle biochemical differences caused by the specially tuned proteins, he took a bit longer than usual to bring the image that Alex was focusing on into view.\n\n\u201c \u2018Becoming Contextual\u2019,\u201d Frank said aloud, \u201c \u2018 by Uru G\u2019danic\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u2018Okay Alex,\u2019 he thought, \u2018I see it now. All you need to do from here is to listen to my voice. While I read it from your memory, the words will reinforce your remembered experience of having read the manuscript, and that in turn will keep the rest of your memory of the experience going. It will act like a feedback loop or an attractor, and it will feel like falling into a state of flow, keeping us both focused on the book. The voicerec unit will transcribe what I say, but you\u2019ll still need to edit it when we\u2019re finished.\u2019\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>\u201c \u2018Introduction,\u2019\u201d Frank recited.\n\n>\u2018Everything is alive. Everything is aware. However, to know itself, the everything needed to stand aside, to see itself as it if was something else.\n\n>This basic concept has been expressed in countless ways, by countless bits of the everything as it strives to know itself. Not just by people, for we are not the only bits of the everything capable of enabling it to know itself. For consciousness is a continuum, one that stretches from micro to macro, and one form of awareness, be it in a person or in a rock, is like that of all others.\u2019\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs he read, Frank became less and less aware of the world around him, and even of the fact that he was reading aloud. Flow had taken hold, and he was happily submerged in the reality of words, of the patterns of sound they made, and of the memories they drew towards them from both his own mind and from Alex\u2019s.\n\nBut there was something else, a sense that some other awareness was watching, listening to what he read, and helping to keep the flow of what Uru G\u2019danic had to say from being disturbed.\n\n\u2018We showed me a voice,\u2019 it thought privately, \u2018and it was mine, but it is still no longer.\u2019\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTHE END\n\n&nbsp;\n\n([TOC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gznork26/comments/1c4ue2f/deadly_attractor_table_of_contents/))", "index": "red11_s3_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red11_s3_c0_", "comment_text": "\u201cDeadly Attractor\u201d ([TOC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gznork26/comments/1c4ue2f/deadly_attractor_table_of_contents/))\n\nby P. Orin Zack\n\n[2003]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChapter Sixteen\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cHave you got it?\u201d Mara said apprehensively when Angela joined her outside the courtroom.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d The Australian smiled conspiratorially and opened her hand, revealing the shiny device that had been knocked from their adversary\u2019s grip. She nudged it with her thumb to examine the bisected sunrise design engraved on its face, and then tucked it away in her pack. \u201cGreat suggestion, by the way. Ever considered taking up subversion as a hobby?\u201d\n\nMara laughed grimly. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think I already have. If killing Uru G\u2019danic is part of the GD\u2019s peacekeeping strategy, then mediating conflicts at the Indigenous People\u2019s Coalition might actually qualify.\u201d\n\nAngela looked around at the milling crowd, and then nodded towards the stairs. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I don\u2019t know how much time we\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nKeeping pace, Mara glanced at her. \u201cTime for what?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo have a word with that bastard.\u201d A few steps later, she added, \u201cIn private.\u201d\n\nMara slowed slightly. \u201cBut how? The detention room must be locked now. Wouldn\u2019t the biometrics keep you out?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey would, except that I asked Lenny to add me to the access list this morning.\u201d She picked up the pace, and started down the stairs. \u201cCall it a hunch, like knowing when to change lanes in traffic. I\u2019ll have to thank Frank for introducing us.\u201d\n\nSince there were several people in the detention hallway when they arrived, Angela slowed to a casual stroll and Mara followed suit.\n\nAs they reached the first room, Mara stopped and glanced at the other two doors. \u201cWhich one is he in, and which one has Alex?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince they\u2019re shielded,\u201d Angela said, \u201cI can\u2019t tell from out here, so we\u2019ll just have to open them and see.\u201d She grabbed the handle and pushed, but it didn\u2019t move. \u201cThat answers one question. Since it\u2019s locked, one of them is in here.\u201d She pulled an ID out of her pack and slid it past the reader. \u201cPhony, of course, but it matches my biometrics, in a round-about sort of way.\u201d Then, she showed the laser target her right eye, and a soft tone sounded. \u201cIf anyone comes along,\u201d she said, grabbing the handle, \u201cmake sure they go away.\u201d\n\nIn one smooth motion, she pushed the door open, stepped inside, and closed it behind her. \u201cRemember me?\u201d she said to their adversary, who was facing a map of MexAmerica on the far wall.\n\n\u201cHealer Pascoe,\u201d he said, turning towards her. \u201cOr should I say, Angela. After all, you can\u2019t practice any\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShut up, you son of a bitch,\u201d she shouted, stepping closer. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is now,\u201d he said ominously.\n\n\u201cJust who the hell are you, anyway?\u201d\n\nHe smiled, and in so doing made it all the more obvious just how young he really was. She judged him to be in his early twenties, twenty-four at most, but with a swaggering sense of power that should have been unnatural for someone even twice his age. He was dressed in that nether region separating casual and professional, with just enough flash to fit into either group, but not enough believability to stay there very long.\n\nWhen he didn\u2019t answer, she reached in her pack and slammed the small device onto the table separating them. \u201cAnd what\u2019s this?\u201d\n\nHe started to lunge towards it, so she snapped it up and held it in her fist. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this thing is, or how it works, but Frank and I both saw you using it in Apu\u00e9rto\u2019s memory. And I think you were about to use it a few minutes ago in court.\u201d\n\nHe stared at her fist, as she shook it in the air at him.\n\n\u201cWhat does it do? What happens when you go translucent?\u201d\n\nStill nothing.\n\nShe folded her arms. \u201cAnd what do murder, manipulating healthcare and character assassination have to do with the GD peacekeepers, if that\u2019s who you really work for?\u201d\n\nHe snorted. \u201cWhat rock have you been hiding under, anyway? Did you think the human race hasn\u2019t destroyed itself for the past century out of courtesy or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a glacier, not a rock, you self-important slug,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cMaking that ice cave appear under Franz Joseph last year was your doing, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nHe nodded stiffly. \u201cAn unavoidable side-effect that I\u2019ve regretted ever since, if you really must know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich means,\u201d she said, pleased at being vindicated, \u201cthat whatever you people are doing is far from perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I see,\u201d he said, \u201cand you\u2019ve never made a mistake? Just who the hell do you think you are to be challenging me like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m here to find out. Now tell me your name!\u201d\n\nHe just stared at her.\n\n\u201cA name,\u201d she said stolidly. \u201cI want your name, or I walk out of here and hand this thing to the media.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cRight. And what are you going to tell them? That it\u2019s the ultimate weapon? That it can make people invisible so they can spy at meetings?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said quietly, \u201cI\u2019ll tell them that you can use it to warp events any way you want, that you can cause impossible accidents, change reality. Things like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you expect them to believe you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will,\u201d she whispered, \u201conce I\u2019ve showed them.\u201d\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cNot likely. It\u2019s keyed to my DNA.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cThanks for the tip. Now what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cVacca,\u201d he said, with a cocky nod, \u201cErnie Vacca.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. Now sit.\u201d\n\nHe sat. \u201cOkay. Now what?\u201d\n\nShe held up the gadget again. \u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called a Synergizer. Sort of a cross between a psychic shield and a destabilizer, if that means anything to you.\u201d\n\nShe tapped the symbol etched into it. \u201cAnd this? What does it mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d he said, irritably, \u201cif you want to play show-and-tell, I\u2019m really not interested.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe symbol?\u201d she repeated, forcefully.\n\nVacca shook his head. \u201cIf you knew half as much about symbols as you did about creating false identities, you\u2019d realize that it means transcendence in half-a-dozen cultures.\u201d\n\nShe turned it to face her. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty strange sentiment for a group that goes around killing people, unless of course you meant it to represent the journey you\u2019ve forced people like Uru G\u2019danic and Vern Cuoku to take.\u201d\n\nHe huffed. \u201cCome on, Angela. Neither of them were my doing.\u201d\n\nShe looked him in the eye. \u201cAn associate then? One of the other members of\u2026 what is this so-called peacekeeping organization called, anyway?\u201d\n\nBefore Vacca had a chance to answer, Frank threw the door open.\n\n\u201cBut who\u2019s Lenny?\u201d Mara uselessly asked the air as he passed by.\n\nWhen Angela saw Ernie suddenly look up, she turned around and rose from her seat. \u201cFrank, stop!\u201d she yelled, both hands raised in protest.\n\nSeeing the gadget, Frank grabbed it from her and buried it in his fist.\n\nBehind him, Mara stepped in, slammed the door, and glanced quickly at each in turn, sizing up the situation.\n\nVacca looked at Frank doubtfully. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing with that?\u201d\n\nFrank sneered back. \u201cI don\u2019t know what this thing is, you asshole, but if you don\u2019t tell me what you did to Jerry Suus, I swear I\u2019ll beat you to death with it!\u201d\n\n\u201cFrank!\u201d Mara yelled sharply. When he turned to look at her, she continued in a strong but even voice. \u201cYou won\u2019t get any answers from a dead man.\u201d\n\nAngela pried his hand open. \u201cGive me that thing, Frank. Vacca here says it\u2019s keyed to his DNA.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her, then at the man sitting across the table. \u201cSo you have a name. Great. Now tell me what that thing is.\u201d\n\nVacca shook his head in amusement. \u201cAs I was just telling Angela here, it\u2019s a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAngela?\u201d Frank and Mara said at once.\n\nShe frowned. \u201cLater.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Vacca continued, \u201cit\u2019s a synergizer, not that it\u2019ll mean anything to you.\u201d He rubbed his neck briefly. \u201cListen, do you think you can sit down?  I\u2019m getting a stiff neck looking up at all of you.\u201d\n\nReluctantly, Frank joined Angela at the table. Mara joined them a moment later.\n\n\u201cNow, then,\u201d Angela said, \u201cwe want some answers. A lot of pretty nasty things have been going on, and not just here in Los Angeles, from what Mara told me. The thing is, for some reason, they all seem to involve you, or at least this GD peacekeeping agency you supposedly work for. What are you after, anyway?\u201d\n\nVacca smiled, if that\u2019s what you could call it. \u201cPeace.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, right,\u201d Frank snarled. \u201cYou certainly have a funny way of going about it: killing people, arranging accidents, messing with people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cMessing with causality,\u201d Angela added, \u201ccharacter assassination, wiping people\u2019s memories. Should I go on?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple,\u201d Vacca protested. \u201cThe world is a very complicated place. If we didn\u2019t proactively manage conflict, the world would have blown itself up years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cConflict management?\u201d Mara said suddenly. \u201cIs that what this is about?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Vacca said calmly. \u201cWhy do you think there hasn\u2019t been a real war in a hundred years? The com channel subliminals reduce the need to intervene, but\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, Yeah. I\u2019ve heard your so-called voice of reason.\u201d Angela said. \u201cA former co-worker of yours tells me that they originate in an office block right here in L.A.\u201d\n\nVacca flinched. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I haven\u2019t,\u201d Frank said suddenly. \u201cWhat do they say?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing harmful,\u201d Vacca said uneasily, still watching Angela. \u201cThey remind people to follow the rules, and tells them that they are safe and secure. It\u2019s just good PR, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nFrank struck the table. \u201cI\u2019ve had enough of this bullshit. What do conflict management and subliminal PR have to do with murdering mathematicians like Vern Cuoku? Or with whatever it was that you did to Jerry Suus?\u201d\n\nMara snorted. \u201cOr with making sure that Uru G\u2019danic never gets a chance to finish what he\u2019s started, bringing the world\u2019s aboriginal peoples together in common cause?\u201d\n\nVacca took a long breath. \u201cI told you already. It\u2019s all about keeping the peace. And even with the subliminals, we still need information about what certain individuals and groups are planning. There are too many people on this planet to keep track of all of them. So we hire outside help, people like Korn and Guti\u00e9rez\u2014\u201d\n\nFrank snorted. \u201cYeah. And I suppose you have them all convinced that spying on patients, breaking the Healer\u2019s Oath, is a noble act?\u201d\n\n\u201cCut the crap, Frank.\u201d Vacca shouted. \u201cYou\u2019ve done far worse during your short time on that jury, and I\u2019m sure you used the same rationale, that it\u2019s for a higher purpose.\u201d\n\nFrank frowned, stinging from the sudden pain of forced introspection.\n\n\u201cSo, yeah,\u201d Vacca continued, \u201cwe use people like Carlita Guti\u00e9rez, to gather intelligence from individuals we arrange for them to see. And we need people like Allan Wylie to manage them.\u201d\n\nAngela shook her head in disgust. \u201cWhat a crock! So when some of these people you suspect of whatever you want to charge them with get offended by having to shell out more for their healthcare, and draw a suit against some of the businesses you make use of, it threatens to blow the cover off your twisted little scheme, and you panic.\u201d\n\nVacca rose out of his seat. \u201cAll of those people, and a lot of others, threaten the peace because of the ideas they spread, or because of the movements they support.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a break, Vacca.\u201d Frank said. \u201cWhat kind of paranoid fantasy do you people live in anyway? How can a mathematician possibly threaten the peace?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, you self-righteous jerk,\u201d he said, leaning over the table on his outstretched hands. \u201cI neither know nor care. All we do is watch for conflict, and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nFrank held the gadget up and shook his hand. \u201cThat\u2019s what this thing\u2019s for, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nVacca straightened and crossed his arms. \u201cYes. The synergizer lets us see into the TimeStream, to spot signs of impending conflict, and gives us a way to encourage the events that avoid those conflicts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I suppose,\u201d Mara said gently, \u201cthat it also enables you to encourage events that eliminate the people causing those alleged conflicts. People like Uru G\u2019danic.\u201d\n\nVacca just stared at her.\n\n\u201cAnd the people who threaten to expose you.\u201d Mara said. \u201cLike Alex and me. Like Jerry Suus.\u201d\n\nAngela snorted. \u201cEven former employees it seems.\u201d\n\nHe looked down at his hands, now splayed in front of him. \u201cWhat was done to your friend Jerry shouldn\u2019t have been necessary. The idea is to not be noticed. It\u2019s just that he\u2019d managed to snag a loose end.\u201d\n\n\u201cA loose end?\u201d Frank echoed incredulously. \u201cGreat. I\u2019m sure Jen will be thrilled to learn that her cousin Vern was nothing but a loose end to you people.\u201d\n\nAngela glanced the others. \u201cFor that matter, I suppose you\u2019re going to have to shut all of us up, too?\u201d\n\nFrank laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit too late for that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Then he turned towards Vacca. \u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d\n\nVacca shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do anything.\u201d He stared at Frank for a moment. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019ve trapped me here just means that we\u2019re all now part of a potential conflict that\u2019ll have to be detoured. I know what you\u2019re thinking, and it won\u2019t help. Impending conflicts are easy to spot. With the synergizer, they look like a standing wave in front of a boulder in a stream. So don\u2019t spend any time worrying about it. This \u2018situation\u2019 is already being taken care of.\u201d He casually gestured at the gadget on the table. \u201cA friend of mine, the agent who dealt with G\u2019danic and Cuoku, is watching the patterns we\u2019re making in the TimeStream right now. And when he\u2019s ready, he\u2019ll use his synergizer to make sure it doesn\u2019t come to anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like that, huh?\u201d Mara sighed. \u201cAnd I suppose it doesn\u2019t bother you to know what you\u2019ve destroyed, to know how important G\u2019danic\u2019s work really was, or how his vision of the future could have made your absurd methods unnecessary.\u201d\n\nVacca didn\u2019t answer immediately. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that bothers me,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI do think about that. I wonder what we\u2019ve traded off these past hundred years in the name of peace.\u201d\n\nAngela leaned towards him. \u201cThen do something about it. You\u2019re inside the agency. Take advantage of that position and see what you can do.\u201d\n\nHe laughed weakly. \u201cSure, like what Jerry Suus wanted that juror to do on this case? Don\u2019t you see? The technology makes it a self-correcting system. If anyone gets out of line and tries to make trouble, the others will see it coming and head it off.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike,\u201d Frank said, with dark amusement, \u201cputting humanity on BioStabilization, and keeping some imaginary \u2018peace organ\u2019 in its happy little, deady dull attractor. Sure it\u2019s peaceful, but it is still alive? Is it worth it?\u201d\n\nThey were all silent for a time, none of them sure of what to say or why. Then, Vacca slid his chair back and stood up to stretch. \u201cBy the way,\u201d he said at last, there\u2019s one bit of this that escapes me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d Frank said.\n\n\u201cYeah. Who was that guy that decked me in the courtroom? I didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d\n\nMara smiled. \u201cMy brother Alex. He has a talent for dancing out of people\u2019s way, then hitting them from out of nowhere. That\u2019s why he started a publishing company.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my,\u201d Frank said suddenly. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we see about getting him out of lockup?\u201d\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2026 Friday \u2026\n\nGetting back into the patterns of life, or of work, after a disruption as severe as the one that Frank had just been through always took a while. He\u2019d gone into hiding, in a manner of speaking, since being released from duty at the courthouse on Monday. Everyone at K\u00fcbler-Ross Hospice Center was aware of the need for people with the heightened sensitivities required to be a Healer to free themselves of inner conflicts over their abilities, or about the value of what they did to help their patients. They knew that the pressure placed on Frank by the court, and the unwanted attention given him by the press would have lasting effects. Except for Jen, however, none of them really understood the toll it had taken on his sense of self-worth.\n\nHe\u2019d asked for time to recover, for an open-ended leave-of-absence, and was supported in every way by the entire team. He\u2019d stayed home the past few days to decompress, but today he had come to K\u00fcbler-Ross to clean up his office, to make certain that all of his patients were properly handed off to co-workers, and to say goodbye to some of the staff, at least for now, in person.\n\nFrank put the report he was reviewing away, and stopped to stare out the window. One person he wouldn\u2019t be seeing was Carlita Guti\u00e9rez. In the flurry of revelations that erupted after Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir\u2019s testimony that day, a number of people at Hospice Centers, MedCenters and Insurance offices worldwide were implicated in a far-ranging scheme that not only benefited both corporations named in the suit, but indirectly threatened the integrity of the jurisdictional rulings, and prevented an unknown number of people from getting the kinds of timely healthcare for which they had registered their preferences in the global MedNet. Carlita was implicated in a pattern of patient misdirection that had begun years earlier in Mexico City. While she retained a license to practice, she was prohibited from working in any Hospice having a patient-transfer relationship with any MedCenter operated by HealthTech Resources. Consequently, she had elected to leave Los Angeles, and refused to disclose her destination.\n\nJen, having put her suspicions about what had happened to her cousin Vern to rest, was happily back in the flow of ensuring that life went smoothly at K\u00fcbler-Ross. When the data auditors at BlackBox recovered the missing incident report, she was satisfied that the flight her cousin had been on really did have an accident.\n\nThe insistent attention tone broke into Frank\u2019s reverie. He blinked a few times, and then looked down at the familiar face on his display. \u201cYeah, Jen?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you wanted to be left alone, Frank, but you have a visitor.\u201d\n\nFrank hesitated upon stepping into the lobby, for Administrator Apu\u00e9rto was standing near the information counter, admiring one of the free-form sculptures. He wasn\u2019t entirely certain how the man felt about him, considering all that had happened since Frank had attempted to examine Jerry at the MedCenter.\n\nAt Frank\u2019s approach, Apu\u00e9rto nodded, and waited for him to make the first move.\n\n\u201cJoin me for some coffee?\u201d Frank said uneasily, concerned about whether the man\u2019s unexpected visit was a prelude to some delayed retaliation for having kidnapped him and placed him in danger. On the way down the main hallway towards the break room, he added, \u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Apu\u00e9rto said, \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to thank you for helping to expose the problems in our process. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of how much value we place on\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Frank said, stepping to the break room, \u201cbut I stopped following the case when the jury released me from duty. How did it turn out?\u201d\n\nThey got drinks and sat at one of the tables.\n\n\u201cOkay, I suppose,\u201d Apu\u00e9rto said as he stirred in some milk, \u201cbut I\u2019ve never been too clear on how these metasystem problems occur. After all, if you examine each of the processes on their own, they work perfectly fine. Yet, when you let them interact, when you have the solid processes developed for MedCenters, Insurance carriers and Hospices bump up against one another, all hell breaks loose.\u201d He took a sip. \u201cSpeaking of which, how\u2019s your neural problem doing?\u201d\n\nFrank grimaced. \u201cWhen I realized that the experimental energy sprite wasn\u2019t working properly, I had it removed, but then you probably know about that since it happened in the middle of testimony.\u201d\n\nApu\u00e9rto nodded. \u201cSo, what are you going to do? Try another sprite?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. The Healer that set it up for me isn\u2019t here any longer. She was one of the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right. She was in court that day, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\nFrank nodded. \u201cI\u2019d already left by then, so I don\u2019t know how it happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was odd, really.\u201d Apu\u00e9rto paused in thought. \u201cOne of the other people in court, the man sitting beside her, as I recall, actually implicated her.\u201d\n\nWylie, Frank thought.\n\n\u201cIt was one of those bizarre outbursts that got so overused in the early potboilers. Anyway, I had a thought. I\u2019d like to offer our services, to help find a solution to your problem.\u201d\n\nFrank sat back.\n\n\u201cI know that gentech treatments are pretty expensive, but my staff tell me they have an idea that might work, and I\u2019d like to give them a chance to find out.\u201d\n\nFrank took a drink.\n\nApu\u00e9rto frowned. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re willing, of course. Oh, it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s on the house, at no cost to you. My way of saying thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven though I put you in danger?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd saved my life.\u201d The administrator looked around for a moment. \u201cOh, there\u2019s one more thing. I brought this...\u201d He fished in his pocket, and pulled out a sheet of digital paper, one of the flexiforms that circulated along with MedCenter patients. \u201cIt\u2019s a transfer order. I think you know the man. We wanted to know if your staff could do anything beyond what we were able to.\u201d\n\nFrank read it twice before looking up. The name on the form was Jeraboam Suus.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u201cSo, this is Pegwin,\u201d Angela, said, while beeping the baby\u2019s nose.\n\nMara adjusted her grip on Peg. \u201cHi Cynthia, Lenny. We just finished dinner, but you\u2019re both welcome to join us for dessert. We\u2019re  having a minor celebration tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo shopping, did you?\u201d Frank asked, indicating the first non-drab outfit he\u2019d seen her in since they\u2019d met. \u201cBy the way, would you prefer Cynthia or Angela.\n\n\u201cAngela. Yeah, well, after what we found out on Monday, there didn\u2019t seem to be much point in staying quite that far underground. Besides, I\u2019ve been thinking about heading back to Canberra, and wanted something nice to wear when I show Lenny around Parliament House.\u201d\n\nMara smiled. \u201cDoes that mean you two are thinking about having a relationship.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Lenny laughed, \u201cwe already have one. And after talking about it, we also realized that our talents complemented one another nicely, too. So we\u2019re going to play tourist for a while just to get the feel of not being a solo act anymore, and we\u2019ll take it from there.\u201d\n\n\u201cSolo act?\u201d Frank said. \u201cI thought you worked with those people I ran into outside the courthouse. Like that woman who smashed my glasses?\u201d\n\n\u201cVanessa?\u201d Lenny shook his head. \u201cI guess you could call her a day-worker. If you walk into any town and stir up some trouble, you\u2019ll have at least a few random helpers for a day or two. They come and go, but you rarely see any of them a second time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubliminals, no doubt,\u201d Mara noted.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of which,\u201d Lenny said. \u201cI think they moved it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater, lover,\u201d Angela said. Then, looking at Frank, she added, \u201cSo what\u2019s the celebration?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo things really. I officially went on leave this afternoon, and Mara comes off hers on Monday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Mara said happily. \u201cAfter what happened this week at the Aboriginal Nations Summit, the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Angela said suddenly. \u201cThat was this week, wasn\u2019t it. How did they handle Uru G\u2019danic\u2019s death?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot well,\u201d Frank said, \u201cfrom what Alex tells us. He flew back to Halifax as soon as we got him released from temporary custody at the courthouse. There was a lot of low-level bickering among the delegates, what with the loss of G\u2019danic\u2019s insights and all, but at least the organization survived.\u201d\n\nLenny frowned at the interruption. \u201cYou were saying, Mara?\u201d\n\nShe nodded graciously. \u201cHave you ever considered taking up facilitating?\u201d\n\n\u201cI already do,\u201d he laughed, \u201cjust in another context. You were saying\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Indigenous Peoples\u2019 Coalition is one of the bodies that supports the ANO. In fact, we\u2019d been instrumental in having created that organization in the first place. Anyway, what we do is help the various groups to work together on outside projects, but to do that, they have to be able to not only understand one another, but to think like one another. G\u2019danic\u2019s work was similar, but on a different scale. In his absence, though, we\u2019re the means to the ends he\u2019d spoken about.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd written about,\u201d Frank added sadly. \u201cBut now nobody will ever read it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook,\u201d Mara said, \u201cbefore this gets me too melancholy, I\u2019m going to get us all some cake.\u201d She handed Peg to Frank.\n\nAs she rose to leave, Angela turned towards Frank, who was busy cuddling Peg. \u201cMara mentioned that. Wasn\u2019t Alex planning to publish G\u2019danic\u2019s book?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was, but with all of the files gone, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nThe discussion dead-ended at that point until Mara returned with four slices of chocolate raspberry cake with mol\u00e9 icing. After an impromptu salute to the future over raised forks, they shared a modern reflection of an ancient religious rite, and didn\u2019t dilute the full effect of chocolate with idle chatter.\n\nLenny was the first to break the pleasant silence that followed. \u201cI just had a thought. I heard that the files were destroyed, as well as any supporting materials, but has anyone read a reasonably complete draft of this guy\u2019s book?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Mara said. \u201cAlex said that he did. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m no psychic,\u201d Lenny said uneasily, \u201cand I\u2019m not too clear on how you do these things, but there\u2019s been a lot in the news this week about why the courts use psychics to monitor testimony. The thing that caught my interest was the idea that you could actually pick out more detail from a witness\u2019 memories than the witness might be able to recall. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure,\u201d Frank said. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2026\u201d\n\nAngela picked up the slack. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Lenny said, \u201cif that\u2019s so, then wouldn\u2019t you be able to just extract a copy of it from Alex\u2019s memory?\u201d\n\nFrank sat back. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting idea, but it\u2019s just not that simple. There are all kinds of memories: sounds, sights, smells, even thoughts and emotions. It\u2019s tricky enough to pull the details from those sorts of memories. But to get an entire book?\u201d\n\nAngela held up a hand. \u201cWait a bit.\u201d She looked at Lenny briefly. \u201cHe might be onto something here. What if you put Alex into a light trance, and had him remember reading the book.\u201d She turned towards Frank. \u201cThen, if you were linked to him, and had a voice-rec unit handy, you could read it aloud and have the thing transcribed. It might work.\u201d\n\nFrank looked at her doubtfully.\n\n\u201cWhat can you lose? The worst that can happen is that it doesn\u2019t work, and you don\u2019t have a copy of a book that\u2019s already lost.\u201d After a pause, she added, \u201cWell, if you don\u2019t have another attack in the midst of it, anyway. What are you going to do about that neural problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t really want to take him up on his offer, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOffer?\u201d Mara said.\n\n\u201cYeah. When Apu\u00e9rto came over to the Hospice today with Jerry\u2019s transfer order, he also offered to have his gentech staff work up a solution to this thing. He said it would be on the house, in thanks for saving his life and all. It\u2019s just that MedCenters are so uncomfortable to be in, and I\u2019d have to go there a number of times.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop whining, Frank,\u201d Angela scolded him. \u201cI think this is a bit more important than your being uncomfortable for a while. Think about what it means to Mara, what it means to Alex. Heck, think what it might mean for the whole world.\u201d\n\nFrank looked at the floor. \u201cWell\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLenny,\u201d she said, \u201cI think we\u2019d best leave these two to talk it over.\u201d\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\u2026 A few weeks later \u2026\n\nAlex LeBlanc returned to Los Angeles on the strength of a cryptic request from his sister. She\u2019d told him only that it had to do with a new book that she thought he might be interested in publishing. Needing a break after the depressing time he\u2019d spent at the Summit, he took the first sub-orbital flight out, and on a reputable carrier.\n\nNeither Mara nor Frank said a word about it on their way back from Columbia Spaceport, and continued to keep him in the dark through dinner as well. Finally, halfway through dessert, Alex finally broke.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand this any longer, sis,\u201d he said, waving his fork at her. \u201cWhat\u2019s the secret? What\u2019s the book? Who\u2019s the author? When do we meet?\u201d\n\nMara laughed. \u201cYou already know all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nFrank pointed at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve already read it, anyway.\u201d\n\nAlex jabbed his fork into the remains of his cake, and left it standing there like Excalibur before Arthur happened by. \u201cAre you going to tell me what this is about, or am I going to have to hold your daughter for ransom?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Frank said, hands raised. \u201cI think it\u2019s called \u2018Becoming Contextual,\u2019 or something like that.\u201d\n\nAlex stared at him. \u201cG\u2019danic\u2019s book? But there\u2019s not a shred left of it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think there is,\u201d Mara said. \u201cNow finish your dessert.\u201d\n\nWith his mouth full of cake, Alex pointed to his empty plate. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, almost unintelligibly, \u201cWhere\u2019s the book?\u201d\n\nMara reached towards him and tapped his head. \u201cIn there.\u201d\n\nHe struggled to swallow the cake. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said you\u2019d read it.\u201d\n\nHe shook his head. \u201cSo what? It\u2019s not like I have a photographic memory or something.\u201d\n\nFrank smiled. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s still in there. Some friends of ours suggested that I link with you, and read it into a voicerec unit.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Alex sat back, blinked a few times, and then dropped his jaw.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLater that evening, with the gentle sound of Mara\u2019s favorite acoustic artist at the fringe of audibility, Frank helped Alex into a light trance.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said softly, \u201cI want to you remember the day you sat down to read G\u2019danic\u2019s manuscript. Put all of the distractions of that day away, and focus only on the book. You\u2019ve got the title page in front of you, and there\u2019s nothing else in the world more important than reading this book. Stay there while I link in, and then we can read it together.\u201d\n\nFrank had been to East-Side MedCenter a half dozen times over the past few weeks, enduring its psychic maelstrom during the lengthy process of setting up and tuning the gentech meds. His initial visit had been the worst, and not just because of the samples and tests they needed. Worse than that was the occasional unplanned glimpse into the anguish broadcast by some of the patients.\n\nThe MedCenter team finished their work a few days earlier, and Mara called Alex soon after that. This would be Frank\u2019s first deep link with the gentech in his system, and he wasn\u2019t too thrilled with the possibility of learning how well it worked with Mara\u2019s brother at risk. But since they were both willing to take the risk, he closed his eyes, slowed his breath, and reached into Alex\u2019s mind.\n\nThe first thing he noticed was that it was more difficult to synch properly with the memory substrate. Assuming that it was simply a matter of acclimatizing to the subtle biochemical differences caused by the specially tuned proteins, he took a bit longer than usual to bring the image that Alex was focusing on into view.\n\n\u201c \u2018Becoming Contextual\u2019,\u201d Frank said aloud, \u201c \u2018 by Uru G\u2019danic\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u2018Okay Alex,\u2019 he thought, \u2018I see it now. All you need to do from here is to listen to my voice. While I read it from your memory, the words will reinforce your remembered experience of having read the manuscript, and that in turn will keep the rest of your memory of the experience going. It will act like a feedback loop or an attractor, and it will feel like falling into a state of flow, keeping us both focused on the book. The voicerec unit will transcribe what I say, but you\u2019ll still need to edit it when we\u2019re finished.\u2019\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>\u201c \u2018Introduction,\u2019\u201d Frank recited.\n\n>\u2018Everything is alive. Everything is aware. However, to know itself, the everything needed to stand aside, to see itself as it if was something else.\n\n>This basic concept has been expressed in countless ways, by countless bits of the everything as it strives to know itself. Not just by people, for we are not the only bits of the everything capable of enabling it to know itself. For consciousness is a continuum, one that stretches from micro to macro, and one form of awareness, be it in a person or in a rock, is like that of all others.\u2019\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs he read, Frank became less and less aware of the world around him, and even of the fact that he was reading aloud. Flow had taken hold, and he was happily submerged in the reality of words, of the patterns of sound they made, and of the memories they drew towards them from both his own mind and from Alex\u2019s.\n\nBut there was something else, a sense that some other awareness was watching, listening to what he read, and helping to keep the flow of what Uru G\u2019danic had to say from being disturbed.\n\n\u2018We showed me a voice,\u2019 it thought privately, \u2018and it was mine, but it is still no longer.\u2019\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTHE END\n\n&nbsp;\n\n([TOC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gznork26/comments/1c4ue2f/deadly_attractor_table_of_contents/))", "comment_created_utc": 1714474975.0, "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

Tonight was her first gala since the New Year; everything needed to be perfect. Eleanor strode through the ballroom, her fingers grazing the cotton tablecloths as she eyed the decorations with a harsh gaze.\n\nEleanor was barefoot, dressed in a simple nightgown, her hair done up in curlers. It was odd for a woman of her status to let herself be seen in such a state, but Eleanor trusted her staff not to gossip, and she didn\u2019t see her husband nearly enough for him to cause a problem. \n\nAfter a final sweep of the room, she deemed it fit for the ball and headed up the grand staircase to her room. There, she spent the next two hours getting ready. She carved cheekbones with a light brown powder, lined her eyes to make them look sharper, and selected the perfect nude to color her lips. She was beautiful, agonizingly so. \nBlonde curls flowed effortlessly down her shoulders, her dress a misty blue; it always matched the flowers. She wore diamonds around her neck and ears, though they reminded one more of pristine water droplets than real gems. Without the click of her heels on the hardwood, one would think she was merely floating down the hallway. \n\nEleanor reached the top of the grand staircase, stopping to look down on the guests mingling below. She observed them for a moment, invisible to them on the stairs like she was a falcon preparing to swoop down and snatch up prey. That\u2019s what Eleanor fancied herself: a predator. The ballroom was enormous. Looking down at it almost gave her vertigo; she was standing on a precipice of good manners and fake laughter, ready to jump. Marvelous, intricate carvings stretched to the ceiling, lit perfectly by several glass chandeliers, ready to fall in a clash of glass and blood. \n\nEleanor inhaled deeply, oxygen reaching the dark depths of her lungs, excitement making her head spin. The chorus of small talk stopped, all eyes on her as she descended; the echo of heels was deafening. She often gave a welcome once she reached the bottom, but tonight, it felt redundant. So, as she stepped on the floor level with her guests, she smiled, waved her hand, and said in a casual but practiced tone, \u201cWell, go on!\u201d\n\nThe chorus returned. Eleanor began to make her rounds, determined to talk to every guest. She snagged a glass of champagne on her way to chat with her bridge group.\n\n\u201cLadies! How are we this evening? I\u2019m dying to catch up,\u201d Eleanor said, a convincing fake smile plastered on her face.  \n\n\u201cEleanor, you have done it again! The ball has barely started, and it's already an exceptional hit,\u201d the woman across from Eleanor said.\n\n\u201cThank you, Charlotte,\u201d Eleanor responded, \u201cSo, catch me up! I haven\u2019t heard a piece of news in a whole week.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone shouldn\u2019t miss the weekly bridge game, then,\u201d Charlotte said, a cheerycheery tone replaced by a passive-aggressive one.\n\n\u201cOh, come off it, Charlotte, it's not Eleanor\u2019s fault,\u201d another woman commented.\n\n\u201cThank you, Elsie. If you want to blame anyone, blame Henry.\u201d Eleanor smirked, \u201cHe\u2019s the one who kept me up so late\u2026\u201d\n\nThe girls giggled at the suggestive comment and delved into catching Eleanor up on what she missed. \n\nSeveral conversations and one crude comment from one of Henry\u2019s coworkers later, Eleanor decided to slip away for a moment. She dipped into the kitchen, using the back staircase to avoid suspicion. She walked into the library, another great room in her home, though hardly any rooms were less than vast. The library was dark, relying heavily on big windows that let in natural light and a few gas lamps that flickered weakly. There were rows and rows of bookshelves reaching to the ceiling. Eleanor had always wanted a sliding ladder, but Henry didn\u2019t see the point in her reading, much less her physically climbing literary heights. A small seating area was opposite the door, with plush leather chairs and ashtrays stacked on end tables. Eleanor loved the library; it was always quiet, not that the mansion was ever loud, but the books seemed to have a way of oppressing the mere thought of noise. \n\nIt was not quiet now. Eleanor could hear the light rustle of turning pages and the soft in and out of breath. Someone was there, standing in her library, leafing through one of her books. \n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Eleanor asked, anger and suspicion evident in her voice. \n\nThe man, loitering in the middle of her library, looked up and smiled at her. \n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d the man questioned back.\n\n\u201cI asked first,\u201d Eleanor replied.\n\n\u201cI asked second,\u201d the man said; Eleanor rolled her eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my house.\u201d\n\nThe man narrowed his eyes before his face split into the same easy smile, \u201cFine, I concede. You win. Wesley Ackworth,\u201d he said, extending his hand toward Eleanor. \n\nEleanor looked him up and down before gingerly taking his hand, \u2018Eleanor Montgomery.\u201d\n\nWesley was handsome. He was tall and fit. His dark hair fell perfectly on his face, and he wore a gentle smile that lit up his light brown eyes. She would have been flustered if she had not spent most of her time staring at a mirror, practicing and perfecting her facial expressions, controlling the minuscule muscles that threatened to twitch. She had half the mind to order him to leave and let her bask in silence. Instead, she gestured for him to sit opposite her in the extravagant leather chair. \n\n\u201cWhy are you in my library?\u201d She questioned, intrigue trumping anger. \n\n\u201cI was bored,\u201d the man sighed. \n\n\tEleanor narrowed her eyes, \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI don\u2019t know you either; we already have so much in common.\u201d\n\nEleanor scoffed and pressed on, \u201cI know everyone here, but not you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came with Charlotte.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharlotte Baker?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wesley said, \u201cI believe she is in your bridge group.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s lovely to play with,\u201d Eleanor lied effortlessly.\n\t\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she is,\u201d Wesley said, smiling knowingly, \u201cIs it my turn to ask a question?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Eleanor said. \n\t\n\u201cYou don\u2019t drink,\u201d Wesley says, though it's not a question. \n\t\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I give you Sherlock Holmes,\u201d Eleanor responded, tilting her head toward the end table where she had set down her glass. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s full.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just refilled.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a cold liquid is poured into a warm glass, condensation forms on the outside. And yet, I find there is an absence of condensation on your glass.\u201d\n\nEleanor said nothing, choosing to glare at Wesley, curiosity bubbling in her stomach.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any lipstick marks on the rim of the glass either,\u201d Wesley continued; Eleanor unconsciously pursed her lips. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a careful drinker.\u201d\n\t\nThe pair stared at each other for a long second, like cowboys ready to draw. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI don\u2019t drink,\u201d Eleanor said, suddenly bored of the game. \n\t\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he questioned.\n\t\n\u201cUh uh uh,\u201d Eleanor tsked, \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to ask a question.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Eleanor asked.\n\t\n\u201cI came with Charlotte, as I\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cCharlotte has a husband. Are you her mistress?\u201d she asked, voice laced with sarcasm.\n\t\nWesley rolled his eyes, \u201cHe\u2019s sick. I\u2019m her brother. \u201d\n\t\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Eleanor gasped, feigned sympathy plastered on her face, leaning forward in mock interest. \n\t\nWesley stared at her momentarily, eyes sliding up and down her figure.\n\t\n\u201cHe\u2019s dying, actually\u2014cancer. I\u2019m here in his absence,\u201d he said.\n\t\n\u201cPoor Charlotte,\u201d Eleanor said, concern etched into her voice, tears forming but never spilling. \n\t\n\u201cPoor, poor Charlotte,\u201d Wesley smiled knowingly.\n\t\n\u201cIt\u2019s good you\u2019re here then.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cYes. It is,\u201d Wesley said, leaning toward Eleanor as he spoke, flirtation dripping from his voice.\n\t\nEleanor mirrored his action and opened her mouth to say something but thought better. Instead, she smirked, lifted herself from her chair, grabbed her drink, and left.\n\t\nThe rest of the party went along as they all did: she pretended to be drunker than she was, spilling messy secrets in not-so-hushed whispers before ending the night bidding adieu from the top of the stairs. She would then retire to her room and sleep as if she were a corpse: dead and peaceful.\n\t\nTwo days later, Eleanor received a thank you note. This wasn\u2019t uncommon; she usually got five or six, but his letter differed. It was more personal than the other letters, which were littered with simple pleasantries and thanks. \n\n\nMy Dearest Eleanor,\n\nI cannot say I enjoyed most of the party; in fact, most of it was immensely dreary. You weren\u2019t, though. I\u2019ll be in attendance next time. In the same spot. I look forward to your company.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Wesley \n\nThough the note's confidence amused Eleanor, she told herself she would not sneak away to the library during the next ball. She was lying, of course; blood thudded through her veins, and a small tingling sounded through her whole body. It was a feeling she had yet to feel about another person: excitement\u2014not the dull, fleeting excitement lying brought her.\n\nA month and four days had passed since Eleanor\u2019s last gala. She stood in the ballroom, practically giddy with excitement. She could feel it in her fingertips, the buzzing that made her feel alive. It was stupid. She knew it was. How could a woman like her be so excited to throw a party? But she was. God, she was. Eleanor came up with the conclusion that it was the control\u2014 the weight of the strings as she maneuvered them like puppets. She craved it.\n\t\nEleanor\u2019s gown was green this time \u2014dark and emerald. Tendrils of lace stretched down her arms, mimicking vines. She had dainty white flowers stuck in her hair. It was the beginning of spring, and Eleanor loved a theme. \n\t\nIt was nearing the end of the ball when Eleanor ascended the stairs and walked down the familiar dark hallway. She was eager but forced herself to slow down her steps so as not to give off her anticipation. She stalled in front of the door, dark wood carved with intricate florals, taking a deep breath to the jittering of her brain. It sickened her to want something so innocently \u2014to be antsy like a child. \n\t\n\u201cEleanor,\u201d Wesley called; he was sitting in the same chair as last time, back turned to her. \n\n\u201cWesley,\u201d Eleanor responded, sitting opposite him; her champagne glass thunked dully as it hit the side table. \n\t\n\u201cHave you been here the whole time?\u201d Eleanor asked, eyeing the book propped open in Wesley\u2019s lap.\n\t\n\u201cI had a drink first.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cIs someone a little eager?\u201d she teased, deflecting her excitement. \n\t\n\u201cSomeone is very bored of the socialite life already,\u201d Wesley said, closing the book and plopping it down on a side table. \n\t\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been to one party, Wesley. Calling yourself a socialite is so egotistical of you,\u201d Eleanor scoffed.\n\t\n\u201cOh, because it takes so much to be wealthy and beautiful.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cDarling, more than you would ever believe,\u201d she said, leaning in as if it were a secret.\n\t\nWesley laughed and rolled his eyes, letting silence settle over them before asking, \u201cIs it my turn to ask a question?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWhy do you pretend to be someone you are not?\u201d\n\t\nEleanor stalled for a moment, \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun?\u201d \n\t\n\u201cIs that not a sufficient answer?\u201d she narrowed her eyes at him.\n\t\n\u201cWhat is the honest answer?\u201d he said.\n\t\n\u201cI get a question first,\u201d she smirked.\n\t\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cAre you some kind of recluse? There has to be a reason I\u2019ve never seen you.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI live in America.\u201d\n\t\nShe laughed shortly, \u201cWell, that would be why.\u201d\n\t\nHe smiled before restating the question, \u201cWhat is the honest answer?\n\t\n\u201cYou know, I pity your wife. You obviously don\u2019t know that a lady requires a little foreplay before jumping right in.\u201d\n\t\nHe smirked but stayed silent. \n\nEleanor sighed, \u201cFor a second, Wesley, imagine my life. I\u2019m home, alone, all day with nothing to do but sit with myself. I was going mad; one can only have so many brunches before they get exceptionally dull. So I started\u2026pretending as you so gracefully put it. It made my life interesting again.\u201d \n\t\nWesley simply stared at her, eyes narrowing. Calculating. \n\t\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m lying,\u201d she smiled. \n\t\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t,\u201d Wesley said.\n\t\n\n\tMy Dearest Eleanor,\n\t               \n\t\tThere are other things that can make your life interesting.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Wesley\n\nEleanor did not respond. She tucked the letter away in the bottom drawer of her bedside table. She knew her silence was answer enough. \n\nOnce, they met on a balcony. It was the middle of summer, and Eleanor decided to have the ball in the courtyard. It made more sense in the warmer months; the house would get too stuffy to be comfortable with so many people. \n\nA soft, warm wind caressed Eleanor\u2019s face. She sighed. They hadn\u2019t had much to talk about tonight; Charlotte\u2019s husband passed only a week prior, putting a sort of damper on the party. The two were standing on a terrace off the side of the house so as not to be in full view of the guests. \n\t\n\u201cWesley, I\u2019m bored,\u201d Eleanor complained. \n\t\n\u201cIs it my turn to ask a question?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI honestly do not care.\u201d\n\t\nWesley smiled at her, \u201cDo you love him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHenry?\u201d she asked.\n\t\nWesley nodded.\n\t\n\u201cNo,\u201d she stated simply.\n\t\n\u201cThen why are you with him?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI have no other choice.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cYou always have a choice, Eleanor,\u201d Wesley sighed. \n\t\n\u201cMaybe you do. That\u2019s not how it works for us.\u201d\n\t\nWesley rolled his eyes, \u201cUs?\u201d\n\n\u201cUs. Women. Wesley, I was married a week after my 18th birthday. I hadn\u2019t even met Henry yet. Do you have any idea what that\u2019s like?\u201d Eleanor said as she felt rage rise within her, threatening to spill out in the form of saline and salt. \n\t\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he said.\n\t\nEleanor scoffed.\n\t\n\u201cWell, you have a choice now, at least,\u201d he supplied.\n\t\n\u201cOh yeah, and what choice is that?\u201d Eleanor laughed mirthlessly.\n\t\n\u201cYou could leave him.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cAnd give up all the wealth a girl could dream of? No, thank you,\u201d Eleanor joked, desperate to calm the instinct to tear Wesley limb from limb. \n\t\n\u201cIs the wealth worth being married to a prick?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d she said, fake smile plastered on, \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s a prick?\u201d \n\t\n\u201cI work with him,\u201d Wesley said.\n\t\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Since when?\u201d Eleanor asked, slightly taken aback. \n\t\n\u201cI started around five years ago, and then two years later, they asked me to take over the branch in America. Those first three years were terrible; I mean, he really is a wanker. How can one man be so obnoxious?\u201d\n\t\nEleanor laughed genuinely. There was a beat of silence. \n\t\n\u201cDoes he at least love you?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWesley, we sleep in separate rooms. We see each other once a day at dinner, if that. Plus, I\u2019m fairly certain he\u2019s sleeping with Elsie.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cThe dark-haired girl from your bridge group?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cSee, he\u2019s an absolute bastard. She\u2019s not even pretty,\u201d he said, the latter part coming out as a whisper. \n\t\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Wesley added.\n\t\n\u201cThat he\u2019s sleeping with her?\u201d\n\nWesley nodded in response.\n\t\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the way she looks at him. You don\u2019t look at someone like that and not have seen them naked.\u201d\n\t\nWesley chuckled.\n\t\nEleanor smiled, \u201cHow\u2019s your wife then? Better than my wanker of a husband?\u201d\n\t\nWesley glanced down before answering, \u201cI\u2019m not married.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cReally?\u201d she asked.\n\t\n\u201cReally,\u201d he answered.\n\n\n\tMy Dearest, Eleanor,\n\t\t\n\t\tI feel I must apologize. (Not for the wanker comment. I\u2019ve just come from cigars with the man; God, he is obnoxious.) I\u2019m sorry, Eleanor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Wesley\n\nThe letters kept coming, always arriving a day or two after the gala, always without a return address. She would never admit it, but it excited her. She finally had someone to let it. To conspire with. \n\nEleanor loved dancing. Her parents started her in classes when she was six. Fourteen children bumbling around a dance studio trying to master the steps of the waltz through the speakers of a record with a broken needle. The instructor screeched orders over the music. Eleanor had thought her like a hawk, perched in the corner waiting to swoop down on an unsuspecting pair of dancers. She even looked like a hawk with her sharp downward-pointing nose and scowl drawn on her face. \n\nThe children around her whined about the class; quiet whispering about the Hawk\u2019s wrath was all to be heard on their infrequent water breaks. Eleanor would stay silent, instead choosing to watch the Hawk pace the floors, feet stepping in a perfect forty-five-degree angle, head held high. Eleanor was jealous of her menacing grace.\n\nThe truth is Eleanor only cared for dancing if she was leading. The push and pull of dance was one thing, but pushing and pulling another person was her specialty. Some days, a boy would be missing from class, and she volunteered to step in. Eleanor enjoyed the uncertainty in her partner\u2019s face as the music began. She would lead them through a path unfamiliar to them. Only Eleanor knew their next move. She would speed up as the music crescendoed, relying on muscle memory as she made her next step, each dance a performance of her ability to control. \n\nEleanor did not enjoy this dance. She was supposed to be leading it. But now, as Wesley sat across from her in her courtyard, it was her with uncertainty plastered on her face. \n\nEleanor shifted uncomfortably in the metal garden chair. She resented Wesley for how comfortable he looked. He had shown up at her door unannounced wearing a cream-colored dress shirt with the top couple of buttons undone. It was loosely tucked into dark brown slacks. Casual attire suited him; it sickened her to see him so informal, like he was breaking an unspoken rule between them.\n\nIt was beautiful outside. The air was warm and fresh and smelled of blooming honeysuckle. Eleanor took a deep breath. When Eleanor was a child, she and her friends would run out into the fields of her childhood home and pick the flowers right off the tree. She could taste the sickly sweet syrup on her tongue. She grimaced in disgust. \n\t\n\u201cWesley, why are you here?\u201d Eleanor pressed. \n\t\n\u201cI was in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI\u2019m lying,\u201d he admits with a soft smile.\n\nEleanor doesn\u2019t respond, choosing to glare at the man instead. This wasn't the game they played; it was never this dangerous. \n\t\n\u201cI wanted to see you.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWhat if someone saw you come here, Wesley?\u201d she said, anxiety leaking into her voice, \u201cWhat would they think?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWho cares, Eleanor?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI care,\u201d Eleanor said, rising from her seat and looking out at the garden, back to Wesley, her voice forceful, \u201cHow can you be so arrogantarogant?\u201d\n\t\nThey both knew the answer. \n\t\nEleanor could hear the metal scraping of his chair as Wesley stood up. She counted his light steps as he walked toward her. She felt the heat of his body on her back, mere inches from her. Eleanor closed her eyes and sighed. She turned around.\nWesley was so close. She could see the lightest of freckles splattered across his face. \n\n\u201cWesley,\u201d she said cautiously.\n\nHe stayed silent. They stood there, staring at each other like a strange game of chicken. Eleanor didn\u2019t know how long the staring contest lasted; it could have been hours. And then it was over. Eleanor looked away. Then Wesley\u2019s hands were cupping her face and pulling her forward. His hands were warm and soft, the privilege of white collar evident to the touch. His lips were rougher than expected, but she leaned in regardless. Her hands were trapped between them, laying flat on Wesley\u2019s chest. Warmth spread through her whole body; she grabbed desperately at his shirt, pulling him closer before shoving him away entirely. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d tears fell from her golden lashes, her voice fluttered with emotion.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Wesley said quietly, so very quietly. \n\nEleanor said nothing; she only stared at him apologetically, mouth parted as if she wanted to speak but couldn't find the words. She pushed past him and walked back into the house.\n\nThe next several months went on without mention of the kiss. Eleanor held many more events; she had almost completed her color rotation, though the dresses never repeated. After blue and green, it was creme, then violet, blush, black, and finally a deep vermillion. \n\t\nTonight, Eleanor was wearing vermillion. Holly ran down the rail of the stairs. Twinkling lights hung from the ceiling. A gargantuan tree loomed in the corner of the ballroom, decorated with beautiful glass ornaments. The smell of pine drifted through the whole house, filling Eleanor with a nostalgic itch close to innocence and excitement. Her parents always made such a big deal out of the holidays, showering her with gifts and affection; it was muscle memory for her to be jittery with excitement. \n\nEleanor was seated like a king in the soft leather chair, posture straight as an arrow, face split with a wry grin. The gas lamps that usually lit the library were extinguished and replaced by candles, making the room dim, romantic even. The flickering lights cast harsh shadows on Eleanor; she looked ravishing. \n\n\u201cDid you get me a Christmas gift?\u201d she asked Wesley, eyes glaring.\n\t\n\u201cIn a way,\u201d he smirked at her. \n\t\nShe gasped like a child, \u201cDid you really?\u201d\n\t\nHe pulled a black velvet jewelry box out of his suit pocket. Eleanor gingerly took it into her hands, opening it with cautious hands. It was a slip of paper\u2014a ticket.\n\t\nEleanor\u2019s face fell into a severe expression, \u201cWesley.\u201d\n\t\nWesley stood up from his chair, kneeled before Eleanor, and took her hand into his, \u201cCome with me.\u201d\n\t\nHer stomach plummeted. The ground beneath her feet was gone. Eleanor had not jumped off the cliff; she had been pushed. Pushed into the realm of knowing. She could no longer ignore the passing glances and dripping innuendoes. Wesley ripped off the blindfold, leaving the truth bare and ugly. \n\t\n\u201cWesley,\u201d Eleanor said again, suddenly breathless, vision blurring. \n\t\n\u201cCharlotte is fine. Her husband passed away months ago. It\u2019s time for me to leave. And I want you to come with me, Eleanor.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\t\nEleanor stood up, ripping her hand from his, and turned away, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wesley said quietly. \n\t\n\u201cNo. I won\u2019t go with you.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d he was raising his voice now, sadness edging into his tone.\n\t\n\u201cWesley, I am married,\u201d she says like a mother scolding her child, \u201cI have a life here.\u201d\n\t\nEleanor's back was to him, her posture hunched, like a wounded animal covering gashings of an attack. For the first time in a long time, she seemed frail and small, a baby bird with a broken wing. \n\n\u201cWhat life?\u201d he pauses to breathe,  \u201cYou have no life here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare you,\u201d she is suddenly very quiet; it is not a question. \n\n\u201cEleanor, I love you,\u201d he pleads, \u201cI could give you more than this.\u201d\n\nShe whips around, looking him in the eyes, tears running down her face, \u201cWhy must I always want more!\u201d\n\t \nEleanor does not look frail anymore, her shadow dark and ugly behind her. She stands up tall, her shoulders set. Eleanor is yelling now, voice crescendoing; she\u2019s loud enough that the whole party would hear her if there were not a small orchestra playing downstairs. She does not care. \n\t\nWesley takes a deep gulp of air, \u201cYou were meant to come with me, why don\u2019t you want to?\u201d\n\t\nHis voice is barely audible. \n\t\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Eleanor whispers, more to herself than Wesley, and then a louder, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\t\nHer face is dry, set in stone. Her cheeks are pink with the warmth of the rage boiling inside her. \n\t\n\u201cI just meant that-\u201d\n\t\nShe cuts him off, \u201cNo. You didn\u2019t \u2018just mean.\u2019 I have known you for nearly a year now, Wesley, and you have never once \u2018just meant\u2019 anything. Why am I meant to go with you?\u201d\n\t\nAlready losing the battle, Wesley concedes, \u201cHe told me you would.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWho.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cEleanor, come on. You are smarter than this.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI need you to say it,\u201d she spits. \n\t\nWesley is desperate, trying to put the blindfold back on, mend the wounds he tore, undo what cannot be undone. He is failing. Wesley knows he has no play left; in the metaphorical chess game they have been playing, he is surrounded. Rooks and bishops were slaughtered on the checkered tile; his king was backed into a corner, the white flag in his hand served as his only weapon. \n\t\n\u201cHenry. Henry told me you would go with me. I needed a wife, and he didn\u2019t want you,\u201d he throws the game. \n\t\nShe turns back toward the window, looking into the still night, \u201cGet out.\u201d\n\t\nHis king is gutted, Eleanor stands victorious. \n\n\u201cEleanor,\u201d he pleads.\n\n\u201cGet out, Wesley.\u201d\n\t\nHe turns to leave, knowing hope is lost, dress shoes scuffing across the wooden floor. Wesley pauses in the doorway, the light from the hallway casting dark shadows over his figure.\n\n\u201cI do love you,\u201d he says, no louder than a whisper, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nEleanor hears him take a step.\n\t\n\u201cI would have gone,\u201d she breathes out. \n\t\nHe stops. \n\t\n\u201cEleanor,\u201d Wesley says cautiously.\n\t\n\u201cI would have gone with you. I would have packed my bags, found out when the ship was leaving, and ran down to the dock to meet you.\u201d\n\t\nWesley says nothing, but she hears a soft, broken exhale and the click of his shoes as he recedes down the hallway. \n\nNothing is the same. The parties blur past Eleanor. Blue, then green, then creme, and so on, pass by her in a flurry of rainbow and satin. She drinks. She is sloppy with her lies. Eleanor becomes her facade. Henry and her start to sleep in the same room again, like when they were first married; he suddenly finds her charming where she once was brash. Eleanor pretends to be happy, and so she is. \n\nAnd then it's Christmas, and holly decorates the railings, and a giant tree goes up in the ballroom, and Eleanor is wearing vermillion. Her childlike glee is gone, youthful adolescence no longer shrouding the holiday in glowing lights and neatly wrapped presents. \n\nThere is a letter in the mail. Eleanor reads it just once before lighting a fire in the hand-carved stone fireplace and tossing it in. \n\t\n\t\nMy Dearest, Eleanor, \n\t\t\n\t\tI have married. She\u2019s nice. Lovely, even. Nothing like you. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith all my love,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWesley\n\n", "index": "red11_s4_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red11_s4_c0_", "comment_text": "\u201cA little to the right, William,\u201d Eleanor said warmly, noticing the boy was having trouble centering the baby\u2019s breath and forget-me-nots exploding from the clear crystal vase.\n\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. Montgomery,\u201d William responded with a small smile.\n\nShe had given up on telling him to call her Eleanor, so she gave him a slight nod and went on her way. Tonight was her first gala since the New Year; everything needed to be perfect. Eleanor strode through the ballroom, her fingers grazing the cotton tablecloths as she eyed the decorations with a harsh gaze.\n\nEleanor was barefoot, dressed in a simple nightgown, her hair done up in curlers. It was odd for a woman of her status to let herself be seen in such a state, but Eleanor trusted her staff not to gossip, and she didn\u2019t see her husband nearly enough for him to cause a problem. \n\nAfter a final sweep of the room, she deemed it fit for the ball and headed up the grand staircase to her room. There, she spent the next two hours getting ready. She carved cheekbones with a light brown powder, lined her eyes to make them look sharper, and selected the perfect nude to color her lips. She was beautiful, agonizingly so. \nBlonde curls flowed effortlessly down her shoulders, her dress a misty blue; it always matched the flowers. She wore diamonds around her neck and ears, though they reminded one more of pristine water droplets than real gems. Without the click of her heels on the hardwood, one would think she was merely floating down the hallway. \n\nEleanor reached the top of the grand staircase, stopping to look down on the guests mingling below. She observed them for a moment, invisible to them on the stairs like she was a falcon preparing to swoop down and snatch up prey. That\u2019s what Eleanor fancied herself: a predator. The ballroom was enormous. Looking down at it almost gave her vertigo; she was standing on a precipice of good manners and fake laughter, ready to jump. Marvelous, intricate carvings stretched to the ceiling, lit perfectly by several glass chandeliers, ready to fall in a clash of glass and blood. \n\nEleanor inhaled deeply, oxygen reaching the dark depths of her lungs, excitement making her head spin. The chorus of small talk stopped, all eyes on her as she descended; the echo of heels was deafening. She often gave a welcome once she reached the bottom, but tonight, it felt redundant. So, as she stepped on the floor level with her guests, she smiled, waved her hand, and said in a casual but practiced tone, \u201cWell, go on!\u201d\n\nThe chorus returned. Eleanor began to make her rounds, determined to talk to every guest. She snagged a glass of champagne on her way to chat with her bridge group.\n\n\u201cLadies! How are we this evening? I\u2019m dying to catch up,\u201d Eleanor said, a convincing fake smile plastered on her face.  \n\n\u201cEleanor, you have done it again! The ball has barely started, and it's already an exceptional hit,\u201d the woman across from Eleanor said.\n\n\u201cThank you, Charlotte,\u201d Eleanor responded, \u201cSo, catch me up! I haven\u2019t heard a piece of news in a whole week.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone shouldn\u2019t miss the weekly bridge game, then,\u201d Charlotte said, a cheerycheery tone replaced by a passive-aggressive one.\n\n\u201cOh, come off it, Charlotte, it's not Eleanor\u2019s fault,\u201d another woman commented.\n\n\u201cThank you, Elsie. If you want to blame anyone, blame Henry.\u201d Eleanor smirked, \u201cHe\u2019s the one who kept me up so late\u2026\u201d\n\nThe girls giggled at the suggestive comment and delved into catching Eleanor up on what she missed. \n\nSeveral conversations and one crude comment from one of Henry\u2019s coworkers later, Eleanor decided to slip away for a moment. She dipped into the kitchen, using the back staircase to avoid suspicion. She walked into the library, another great room in her home, though hardly any rooms were less than vast. The library was dark, relying heavily on big windows that let in natural light and a few gas lamps that flickered weakly. There were rows and rows of bookshelves reaching to the ceiling. Eleanor had always wanted a sliding ladder, but Henry didn\u2019t see the point in her reading, much less her physically climbing literary heights. A small seating area was opposite the door, with plush leather chairs and ashtrays stacked on end tables. Eleanor loved the library; it was always quiet, not that the mansion was ever loud, but the books seemed to have a way of oppressing the mere thought of noise. \n\nIt was not quiet now. Eleanor could hear the light rustle of turning pages and the soft in and out of breath. Someone was there, standing in her library, leafing through one of her books. \n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Eleanor asked, anger and suspicion evident in her voice. \n\nThe man, loitering in the middle of her library, looked up and smiled at her. \n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d the man questioned back.\n\n\u201cI asked first,\u201d Eleanor replied.\n\n\u201cI asked second,\u201d the man said; Eleanor rolled her eyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my house.\u201d\n\nThe man narrowed his eyes before his face split into the same easy smile, \u201cFine, I concede. You win. Wesley Ackworth,\u201d he said, extending his hand toward Eleanor. \n\nEleanor looked him up and down before gingerly taking his hand, \u2018Eleanor Montgomery.\u201d\n\nWesley was handsome. He was tall and fit. His dark hair fell perfectly on his face, and he wore a gentle smile that lit up his light brown eyes. She would have been flustered if she had not spent most of her time staring at a mirror, practicing and perfecting her facial expressions, controlling the minuscule muscles that threatened to twitch. She had half the mind to order him to leave and let her bask in silence. Instead, she gestured for him to sit opposite her in the extravagant leather chair. \n\n\u201cWhy are you in my library?\u201d She questioned, intrigue trumping anger. \n\n\u201cI was bored,\u201d the man sighed. \n\n\tEleanor narrowed her eyes, \u201cI don\u2019t know you.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI don\u2019t know you either; we already have so much in common.\u201d\n\nEleanor scoffed and pressed on, \u201cI know everyone here, but not you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came with Charlotte.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharlotte Baker?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wesley said, \u201cI believe she is in your bridge group.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cOh, she\u2019s lovely to play with,\u201d Eleanor lied effortlessly.\n\t\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she is,\u201d Wesley said, smiling knowingly, \u201cIs it my turn to ask a question?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Eleanor said. \n\t\n\u201cYou don\u2019t drink,\u201d Wesley says, though it's not a question. \n\t\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I give you Sherlock Holmes,\u201d Eleanor responded, tilting her head toward the end table where she had set down her glass. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s full.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just refilled.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a cold liquid is poured into a warm glass, condensation forms on the outside. And yet, I find there is an absence of condensation on your glass.\u201d\n\nEleanor said nothing, choosing to glare at Wesley, curiosity bubbling in her stomach.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any lipstick marks on the rim of the glass either,\u201d Wesley continued; Eleanor unconsciously pursed her lips. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m a careful drinker.\u201d\n\t\nThe pair stared at each other for a long second, like cowboys ready to draw. \n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t drink.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI don\u2019t drink,\u201d Eleanor said, suddenly bored of the game. \n\t\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he questioned.\n\t\n\u201cUh uh uh,\u201d Eleanor tsked, \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to ask a question.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Eleanor asked.\n\t\n\u201cI came with Charlotte, as I\u2019ve said.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cCharlotte has a husband. Are you her mistress?\u201d she asked, voice laced with sarcasm.\n\t\nWesley rolled his eyes, \u201cHe\u2019s sick. I\u2019m her brother. \u201d\n\t\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Eleanor gasped, feigned sympathy plastered on her face, leaning forward in mock interest. \n\t\nWesley stared at her momentarily, eyes sliding up and down her figure.\n\t\n\u201cHe\u2019s dying, actually\u2014cancer. I\u2019m here in his absence,\u201d he said.\n\t\n\u201cPoor Charlotte,\u201d Eleanor said, concern etched into her voice, tears forming but never spilling. \n\t\n\u201cPoor, poor Charlotte,\u201d Wesley smiled knowingly.\n\t\n\u201cIt\u2019s good you\u2019re here then.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cYes. It is,\u201d Wesley said, leaning toward Eleanor as he spoke, flirtation dripping from his voice.\n\t\nEleanor mirrored his action and opened her mouth to say something but thought better. Instead, she smirked, lifted herself from her chair, grabbed her drink, and left.\n\t\nThe rest of the party went along as they all did: she pretended to be drunker than she was, spilling messy secrets in not-so-hushed whispers before ending the night bidding adieu from the top of the stairs. She would then retire to her room and sleep as if she were a corpse: dead and peaceful.\n\t\nTwo days later, Eleanor received a thank you note. This wasn\u2019t uncommon; she usually got five or six, but his letter differed. It was more personal than the other letters, which were littered with simple pleasantries and thanks. \n\n\nMy Dearest Eleanor,\n\nI cannot say I enjoyed most of the party; in fact, most of it was immensely dreary. You weren\u2019t, though. I\u2019ll be in attendance next time. In the same spot. I look forward to your company.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Wesley \n\nThough the note's confidence amused Eleanor, she told herself she would not sneak away to the library during the next ball. She was lying, of course; blood thudded through her veins, and a small tingling sounded through her whole body. It was a feeling she had yet to feel about another person: excitement\u2014not the dull, fleeting excitement lying brought her.\n\nA month and four days had passed since Eleanor\u2019s last gala. She stood in the ballroom, practically giddy with excitement. She could feel it in her fingertips, the buzzing that made her feel alive. It was stupid. She knew it was. How could a woman like her be so excited to throw a party? But she was. God, she was. Eleanor came up with the conclusion that it was the control\u2014 the weight of the strings as she maneuvered them like puppets. She craved it.\n\t\nEleanor\u2019s gown was green this time \u2014dark and emerald. Tendrils of lace stretched down her arms, mimicking vines. She had dainty white flowers stuck in her hair. It was the beginning of spring, and Eleanor loved a theme. \n\t\nIt was nearing the end of the ball when Eleanor ascended the stairs and walked down the familiar dark hallway. She was eager but forced herself to slow down her steps so as not to give off her anticipation. She stalled in front of the door, dark wood carved with intricate florals, taking a deep breath to the jittering of her brain. It sickened her to want something so innocently \u2014to be antsy like a child. \n\t\n\u201cEleanor,\u201d Wesley called; he was sitting in the same chair as last time, back turned to her. \n\n\u201cWesley,\u201d Eleanor responded, sitting opposite him; her champagne glass thunked dully as it hit the side table. \n\t\n\u201cHave you been here the whole time?\u201d Eleanor asked, eyeing the book propped open in Wesley\u2019s lap.\n\t\n\u201cI had a drink first.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cIs someone a little eager?\u201d she teased, deflecting her excitement. \n\t\n\u201cSomeone is very bored of the socialite life already,\u201d Wesley said, closing the book and plopping it down on a side table. \n\t\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been to one party, Wesley. Calling yourself a socialite is so egotistical of you,\u201d Eleanor scoffed.\n\t\n\u201cOh, because it takes so much to be wealthy and beautiful.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cDarling, more than you would ever believe,\u201d she said, leaning in as if it were a secret.\n\t\nWesley laughed and rolled his eyes, letting silence settle over them before asking, \u201cIs it my turn to ask a question?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWhy do you pretend to be someone you are not?\u201d\n\t\nEleanor stalled for a moment, \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun?\u201d \n\t\n\u201cIs that not a sufficient answer?\u201d she narrowed her eyes at him.\n\t\n\u201cWhat is the honest answer?\u201d he said.\n\t\n\u201cI get a question first,\u201d she smirked.\n\t\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cAre you some kind of recluse? There has to be a reason I\u2019ve never seen you.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI live in America.\u201d\n\t\nShe laughed shortly, \u201cWell, that would be why.\u201d\n\t\nHe smiled before restating the question, \u201cWhat is the honest answer?\n\t\n\u201cYou know, I pity your wife. You obviously don\u2019t know that a lady requires a little foreplay before jumping right in.\u201d\n\t\nHe smirked but stayed silent. \n\nEleanor sighed, \u201cFor a second, Wesley, imagine my life. I\u2019m home, alone, all day with nothing to do but sit with myself. I was going mad; one can only have so many brunches before they get exceptionally dull. So I started\u2026pretending as you so gracefully put it. It made my life interesting again.\u201d \n\t\nWesley simply stared at her, eyes narrowing. Calculating. \n\t\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m lying,\u201d she smiled. \n\t\n\u201cNo. I don\u2019t,\u201d Wesley said.\n\t\n\n\tMy Dearest Eleanor,\n\t               \n\t\tThere are other things that can make your life interesting.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Wesley\n\nEleanor did not respond. She tucked the letter away in the bottom drawer of her bedside table. She knew her silence was answer enough. \n\nOnce, they met on a balcony. It was the middle of summer, and Eleanor decided to have the ball in the courtyard. It made more sense in the warmer months; the house would get too stuffy to be comfortable with so many people. \n\nA soft, warm wind caressed Eleanor\u2019s face. She sighed. They hadn\u2019t had much to talk about tonight; Charlotte\u2019s husband passed only a week prior, putting a sort of damper on the party. The two were standing on a terrace off the side of the house so as not to be in full view of the guests. \n\t\n\u201cWesley, I\u2019m bored,\u201d Eleanor complained. \n\t\n\u201cIs it my turn to ask a question?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI honestly do not care.\u201d\n\t\nWesley smiled at her, \u201cDo you love him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHenry?\u201d she asked.\n\t\nWesley nodded.\n\t\n\u201cNo,\u201d she stated simply.\n\t\n\u201cThen why are you with him?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI have no other choice.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cYou always have a choice, Eleanor,\u201d Wesley sighed. \n\t\n\u201cMaybe you do. That\u2019s not how it works for us.\u201d\n\t\nWesley rolled his eyes, \u201cUs?\u201d\n\n\u201cUs. Women. Wesley, I was married a week after my 18th birthday. I hadn\u2019t even met Henry yet. Do you have any idea what that\u2019s like?\u201d Eleanor said as she felt rage rise within her, threatening to spill out in the form of saline and salt. \n\t\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t have a choice,\u201d he said.\n\t\nEleanor scoffed.\n\t\n\u201cWell, you have a choice now, at least,\u201d he supplied.\n\t\n\u201cOh yeah, and what choice is that?\u201d Eleanor laughed mirthlessly.\n\t\n\u201cYou could leave him.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cAnd give up all the wealth a girl could dream of? No, thank you,\u201d Eleanor joked, desperate to calm the instinct to tear Wesley limb from limb. \n\t\n\u201cIs the wealth worth being married to a prick?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cOh, absolutely,\u201d she said, fake smile plastered on, \u201cHow do you know he\u2019s a prick?\u201d \n\t\n\u201cI work with him,\u201d Wesley said.\n\t\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Since when?\u201d Eleanor asked, slightly taken aback. \n\t\n\u201cI started around five years ago, and then two years later, they asked me to take over the branch in America. Those first three years were terrible; I mean, he really is a wanker. How can one man be so obnoxious?\u201d\n\t\nEleanor laughed genuinely. There was a beat of silence. \n\t\n\u201cDoes he at least love you?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cHow can you be sure?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWesley, we sleep in separate rooms. We see each other once a day at dinner, if that. Plus, I\u2019m fairly certain he\u2019s sleeping with Elsie.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cThe dark-haired girl from your bridge group?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cSee, he\u2019s an absolute bastard. She\u2019s not even pretty,\u201d he said, the latter part coming out as a whisper. \n\t\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d Wesley added.\n\t\n\u201cThat he\u2019s sleeping with her?\u201d\n\nWesley nodded in response.\n\t\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen the way she looks at him. You don\u2019t look at someone like that and not have seen them naked.\u201d\n\t\nWesley chuckled.\n\t\nEleanor smiled, \u201cHow\u2019s your wife then? Better than my wanker of a husband?\u201d\n\t\nWesley glanced down before answering, \u201cI\u2019m not married.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cReally?\u201d she asked.\n\t\n\u201cReally,\u201d he answered.\n\n\n\tMy Dearest, Eleanor,\n\t\t\n\t\tI feel I must apologize. (Not for the wanker comment. I\u2019ve just come from cigars with the man; God, he is obnoxious.) I\u2019m sorry, Eleanor.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-Wesley\n\nThe letters kept coming, always arriving a day or two after the gala, always without a return address. She would never admit it, but it excited her. She finally had someone to let it. To conspire with. \n\nEleanor loved dancing. Her parents started her in classes when she was six. Fourteen children bumbling around a dance studio trying to master the steps of the waltz through the speakers of a record with a broken needle. The instructor screeched orders over the music. Eleanor had thought her like a hawk, perched in the corner waiting to swoop down on an unsuspecting pair of dancers. She even looked like a hawk with her sharp downward-pointing nose and scowl drawn on her face. \n\nThe children around her whined about the class; quiet whispering about the Hawk\u2019s wrath was all to be heard on their infrequent water breaks. Eleanor would stay silent, instead choosing to watch the Hawk pace the floors, feet stepping in a perfect forty-five-degree angle, head held high. Eleanor was jealous of her menacing grace.\n\nThe truth is Eleanor only cared for dancing if she was leading. The push and pull of dance was one thing, but pushing and pulling another person was her specialty. Some days, a boy would be missing from class, and she volunteered to step in. Eleanor enjoyed the uncertainty in her partner\u2019s face as the music began. She would lead them through a path unfamiliar to them. Only Eleanor knew their next move. She would speed up as the music crescendoed, relying on muscle memory as she made her next step, each dance a performance of her ability to control. \n\nEleanor did not enjoy this dance. She was supposed to be leading it. But now, as Wesley sat across from her in her courtyard, it was her with uncertainty plastered on her face. \n\nEleanor shifted uncomfortably in the metal garden chair. She resented Wesley for how comfortable he looked. He had shown up at her door unannounced wearing a cream-colored dress shirt with the top couple of buttons undone. It was loosely tucked into dark brown slacks. Casual attire suited him; it sickened her to see him so informal, like he was breaking an unspoken rule between them.\n\nIt was beautiful outside. The air was warm and fresh and smelled of blooming honeysuckle. Eleanor took a deep breath. When Eleanor was a child, she and her friends would run out into the fields of her childhood home and pick the flowers right off the tree. She could taste the sickly sweet syrup on her tongue. She grimaced in disgust. \n\t\n\u201cWesley, why are you here?\u201d Eleanor pressed. \n\t\n\u201cI was in the neighborhood.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI\u2019m lying,\u201d he admits with a soft smile.\n\nEleanor doesn\u2019t respond, choosing to glare at the man instead. This wasn't the game they played; it was never this dangerous. \n\t\n\u201cI wanted to see you.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWhat if someone saw you come here, Wesley?\u201d she said, anxiety leaking into her voice, \u201cWhat would they think?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWho cares, Eleanor?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI care,\u201d Eleanor said, rising from her seat and looking out at the garden, back to Wesley, her voice forceful, \u201cHow can you be so arrogantarogant?\u201d\n\t\nThey both knew the answer. \n\t\nEleanor could hear the metal scraping of his chair as Wesley stood up. She counted his light steps as he walked toward her. She felt the heat of his body on her back, mere inches from her. Eleanor closed her eyes and sighed. She turned around.\nWesley was so close. She could see the lightest of freckles splattered across his face. \n\n\u201cWesley,\u201d she said cautiously.\n\nHe stayed silent. They stood there, staring at each other like a strange game of chicken. Eleanor didn\u2019t know how long the staring contest lasted; it could have been hours. And then it was over. Eleanor looked away. Then Wesley\u2019s hands were cupping her face and pulling her forward. His hands were warm and soft, the privilege of white collar evident to the touch. His lips were rougher than expected, but she leaned in regardless. Her hands were trapped between them, laying flat on Wesley\u2019s chest. Warmth spread through her whole body; she grabbed desperately at his shirt, pulling him closer before shoving him away entirely. \n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d tears fell from her golden lashes, her voice fluttered with emotion.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Wesley said quietly, so very quietly. \n\nEleanor said nothing; she only stared at him apologetically, mouth parted as if she wanted to speak but couldn't find the words. She pushed past him and walked back into the house.\n\nThe next several months went on without mention of the kiss. Eleanor held many more events; she had almost completed her color rotation, though the dresses never repeated. After blue and green, it was creme, then violet, blush, black, and finally a deep vermillion. \n\t\nTonight, Eleanor was wearing vermillion. Holly ran down the rail of the stairs. Twinkling lights hung from the ceiling. A gargantuan tree loomed in the corner of the ballroom, decorated with beautiful glass ornaments. The smell of pine drifted through the whole house, filling Eleanor with a nostalgic itch close to innocence and excitement. Her parents always made such a big deal out of the holidays, showering her with gifts and affection; it was muscle memory for her to be jittery with excitement. \n\nEleanor was seated like a king in the soft leather chair, posture straight as an arrow, face split with a wry grin. The gas lamps that usually lit the library were extinguished and replaced by candles, making the room dim, romantic even. The flickering lights cast harsh shadows on Eleanor; she looked ravishing. \n\n\u201cDid you get me a Christmas gift?\u201d she asked Wesley, eyes glaring.\n\t\n\u201cIn a way,\u201d he smirked at her. \n\t\nShe gasped like a child, \u201cDid you really?\u201d\n\t\nHe pulled a black velvet jewelry box out of his suit pocket. Eleanor gingerly took it into her hands, opening it with cautious hands. It was a slip of paper\u2014a ticket.\n\t\nEleanor\u2019s face fell into a severe expression, \u201cWesley.\u201d\n\t\nWesley stood up from his chair, kneeled before Eleanor, and took her hand into his, \u201cCome with me.\u201d\n\t\nHer stomach plummeted. The ground beneath her feet was gone. Eleanor had not jumped off the cliff; she had been pushed. Pushed into the realm of knowing. She could no longer ignore the passing glances and dripping innuendoes. Wesley ripped off the blindfold, leaving the truth bare and ugly. \n\t\n\u201cWesley,\u201d Eleanor said again, suddenly breathless, vision blurring. \n\t\n\u201cCharlotte is fine. Her husband passed away months ago. It\u2019s time for me to leave. And I want you to come with me, Eleanor.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d\n\t\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\t\nEleanor stood up, ripping her hand from his, and turned away, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wesley said quietly. \n\t\n\u201cNo. I won\u2019t go with you.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d he was raising his voice now, sadness edging into his tone.\n\t\n\u201cWesley, I am married,\u201d she says like a mother scolding her child, \u201cI have a life here.\u201d\n\t\nEleanor's back was to him, her posture hunched, like a wounded animal covering gashings of an attack. For the first time in a long time, she seemed frail and small, a baby bird with a broken wing. \n\n\u201cWhat life?\u201d he pauses to breathe,  \u201cYou have no life here.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare you,\u201d she is suddenly very quiet; it is not a question. \n\n\u201cEleanor, I love you,\u201d he pleads, \u201cI could give you more than this.\u201d\n\nShe whips around, looking him in the eyes, tears running down her face, \u201cWhy must I always want more!\u201d\n\t \nEleanor does not look frail anymore, her shadow dark and ugly behind her. She stands up tall, her shoulders set. Eleanor is yelling now, voice crescendoing; she\u2019s loud enough that the whole party would hear her if there were not a small orchestra playing downstairs. She does not care. \n\t\nWesley takes a deep gulp of air, \u201cYou were meant to come with me, why don\u2019t you want to?\u201d\n\t\nHis voice is barely audible. \n\t\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Eleanor whispers, more to herself than Wesley, and then a louder, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\t\nHer face is dry, set in stone. Her cheeks are pink with the warmth of the rage boiling inside her. \n\t\n\u201cI just meant that-\u201d\n\t\nShe cuts him off, \u201cNo. You didn\u2019t \u2018just mean.\u2019 I have known you for nearly a year now, Wesley, and you have never once \u2018just meant\u2019 anything. Why am I meant to go with you?\u201d\n\t\nAlready losing the battle, Wesley concedes, \u201cHe told me you would.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cWho.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cEleanor, come on. You are smarter than this.\u201d\n\t\n\u201cI need you to say it,\u201d she spits. \n\t\nWesley is desperate, trying to put the blindfold back on, mend the wounds he tore, undo what cannot be undone. He is failing. Wesley knows he has no play left; in the metaphorical chess game they have been playing, he is surrounded. Rooks and bishops were slaughtered on the checkered tile; his king was backed into a corner, the white flag in his hand served as his only weapon. \n\t\n\u201cHenry. Henry told me you would go with me. I needed a wife, and he didn\u2019t want you,\u201d he throws the game. \n\t\nShe turns back toward the window, looking into the still night, \u201cGet out.\u201d\n\t\nHis king is gutted, Eleanor stands victorious. \n\n\u201cEleanor,\u201d he pleads.\n\n\u201cGet out, Wesley.\u201d\n\t\nHe turns to leave, knowing hope is lost, dress shoes scuffing across the wooden floor. Wesley pauses in the doorway, the light from the hallway casting dark shadows over his figure.\n\n\u201cI do love you,\u201d he says, no louder than a whisper, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nEleanor hears him take a step.\n\t\n\u201cI would have gone,\u201d she breathes out. \n\t\nHe stops. \n\t\n\u201cEleanor,\u201d Wesley says cautiously.\n\t\n\u201cI would have gone with you. I would have packed my bags, found out when the ship was leaving, and ran down to the dock to meet you.\u201d\n\t\nWesley says nothing, but she hears a soft, broken exhale and the click of his shoes as he recedes down the hallway. \n\nNothing is the same. The parties blur past Eleanor. Blue, then green, then creme, and so on, pass by her in a flurry of rainbow and satin. She drinks. She is sloppy with her lies. Eleanor becomes her facade. Henry and her start to sleep in the same room again, like when they were first married; he suddenly finds her charming where she once was brash. Eleanor pretends to be happy, and so she is. \n\nAnd then it's Christmas, and holly decorates the railings, and a giant tree goes up in the ballroom, and Eleanor is wearing vermillion. Her childlike glee is gone, youthful adolescence no longer shrouding the holiday in glowing lights and neatly wrapped presents. \n\nThere is a letter in the mail. Eleanor reads it just once before lighting a fire in the hand-carved stone fireplace and tossing it in. \n\t\n\t\nMy Dearest, Eleanor, \n\t\t\n\t\tI have married. She\u2019s nice. Lovely, even. Nothing like you. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWith all my love,\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWesley\n\n", "comment_created_utc": 1714430405.0, "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

A newsletter from your favourite online store boasts a discount that is simply \u201cunmissable\u201d, in their words.\n\nYou open it and click on the link in the email newsletter. The store\u2019s website promptly opens, but before you can do any kind of browsing, a pop-up asks you if you would like to \u201caccept all cookies\u201d. *Sure*, you think. *Everyone loves cookies. Who doesn\u2019t love a cookie with a nice glass of milk?* You chuckle pathetically at your own silly joke. These aren\u2019t *those* kinds of cookies, of course. These are internet cookies, which are\u2026 well, you aren\u2019t sure exactly what they are, but you know that cookies are oh-so-important when visiting websites and you\u2019ve never had any problems with them, so you tap \u201caccept\u201d.\n\nThe prompt changes. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d it now says.\n\n*\u200dWhat? Of course I\u2019m sure.* You sit up onto the sofa, a little annoyed by the website\u2019s lack of faith in you being able to make your own digital decisions. *This has never happened before*, you think. *It always just goes away after you click \u201caccept all cookies\u201d!* Why would it now ask if you\u2019re sure? You sit on the sofa, wondering for a moment. *It must be some kind of new internet law to ask people if they\u2019re sure*, you think, shrugging. You tap \u201cyes\u201d.\n\nThe website now shows you a large block of text and asks you to \u201cPlease agree with the terms and conditions before continuing.\u201d *Are you serious? It\u2019s just cookies, guys. What is the big deal here?* Again, you tell yourself it must be part of some new law and blame some menacing looking politician you saw on the news recently.\n\nYou click \u201cagree\u201d without even scrolling through the terms and conditions. The prompt finally closes. *Finally, now I can browse and shop in peace*. Before long, another prompt appears, asking you to download the app. You dismiss it angrily. *I just want to take a look at the sale. Why is that so hard?* You fantasise about building a website where no one is ever bothered by cookies, apps or anything else; a place where people can shop without being hassled. You see the big red banner on the homepage that matches the campaign you saw in the email.\n\nJust as you tap it, there is a knock on the front door.\n\nYou stand up and walk across the living room to go to the front door. You look through the peep-hole. There\u2019s no one there. You open the door, letting in the chilly air of the winter night. On your doorstep sits a brown paper bag. You look at it, wondering if it\u2019s some sort of prank. It\u2019s probably full of rotten food or something. These pesky kids don\u2019t even stop for the holiday season. You really feel old for a second, before you notice that the bag has the logo of the same store you were just shopping on. You crouch down and pick up the bag, confused. *I haven\u2019t ordered anything yet.* You close the front door and bring the bag inside, putting it on the coffee table. It feels warm. You open the bag.\n\nInside are six freshly-baked cookies and a note that says \u201cThank you for accepting our cookies!\u201d *Wow. Free holiday cookies!* You take a cookie out of the bag, biting into it. It is warm and delicious. The buttery taste peppered with cinnamon reminds you of your grandma, and the cookies she would make every holiday season. You are delighted, as well as a little confused, at the cookies. This must be part of some holiday marketing campaign: they make it look like you\u2019re accepting the internet cookies, when it\u2019s actually the real cookies that you\u2019re accepting. *What a brilliant idea!* You mentally congratulate the company for having such a great sense of marketing acumen. You get started on a second cookie. After the third cookie, you bring some milk from the kitchen. You eat the fourth one while sipping the milk. The fifth one you dip into the milk before eating. And the sixth one, you keep in the bag, saving it for tomorrow. *My God, I just ate five cookies. Ah, well \u2014 it\u2019s the holidays!*\n\n\u200dYou\u2019re making a mental note to restart your gym membership in the new year when \u2014 another knock on the door.\n\nYou wonder what that could be. You hope for more cookies, when another part of yourself tells you that you\u2019ve already had enough. You open the door. Another paper bag sits on your doorstep with the same logo. *No way.* You take it and open it up. Another six freshly-baked cookies. *Oh my God. More cookies!* You wonder if this is still part of the campaign or some sort of mistake. *Maybe the website didn\u2019t realise I\u2019ve already received my cookies.* You shrug and shut the door. You put the new bag onto the kitchen counter next to the old one with one remaining cookie. *How are these cookies being delivered, anyway?* You haven\u2019t seen anyone around every time you\u2019ve opened the door. *Maybe they\u2019re being dropped down by a drone or something?*\n\n\u200dYou go and sit down to continue browsing the generous, cookie-giving website that you will definitely be recommending to everyone you know when there is another knock on the door.\n\n*\u200dOkay, now this is just getting unreal.* You open the door as excitement \u2014 as well as fear \u2014 begins to fill up inside you. There is another bag. You\u2019re not sure how to feel. You\u2019re part scared, part annoyed, part happy that there are more cookies and part feeling a little creeped out. *Should I call the police?* You wonder, bringing the third bag inside and placing it next to the other two. *No. What will I tell them? I keep getting free cookies from some website?*\n\n\u200dThere is another knock on the door. You feel frightened. You open it and, sure enough, another bag of warm cookies greets you in cold silence. *Okay, there must be some reason for this. Maybe I can contact the website and see if they can sort it out.* You put the fourth bag next to the others and go back to your phone, finding a solution. You click \u201ccontact us\u201d. You begin chatting with a virtual assistant and you type out your problem just as there is another knock on the door.\n\nYou begin to get agitated. \u201cNo, thank you!\u201d you call out to the front door, hoping whoever \u2014 or whatever \u2014 is delivering these mystery cookies will just stop and leave you alone. You send the message to the bot, telling it that you don\u2019t want any more cookies. The bot responds immediately. \u201cHello,\u201d it says. \u201cUnfortunately, according to the terms and conditions that you agreed to, you are liable to accept all of our cookies.\u201d The bot sends a screenshot of the terms and conditions that you agreed to without reading. \u201cSo we would not be able to terminate the cookies without violating company policy. Thank you for contacting us!\u201d the bot says, signing off.\n\nThere is another knock at your door, this time louder and more aggressive.\n\nYou panic. *What do I do?* Something pops up in the chat, a survey of sorts. \u201cHow would you rate your experience with us today?\u201d It asks you to give a number from a scale of 1 to 10, with \u201c1\u201d being \u201csorry to hear that\u201d and \u201c10\u201d being \u201cglad we could help!\u201d. Irate, with the pounding on your front door getting more and more intense, you type \u201c0\u201d and press \u201csend\u201d.\n\nSuddenly, a message appears in the chat. This time, it\u2019s from a human customer service agent. She says, \u201cHello, my name is Stephanie. I can see that you\u2019ve rated your experience with us as very poor indeed. How can I help to change that, please?\u201d You frantically begin writing to Stephanie, doing your best to ignore the deafening beating coming from the front door.\n\n\u201cHello, Stephanie. Can you help me with this issue, please?\u201d You then type out your entire problem as the thunderous booms coming from your front door become so forceful that you think your front door might fly off its hinges at any second. You send your problem to Stephanie, and she immediately writes back. \u201cOh, the cookie problem. Sorry, but we cannot undo the consent you gave us when you agreed to the terms and conditions. According to my notes here, it was 34 minutes ago. Here is your digital signature.\u201d She resends the screenshot that the bot sent earlier. The loud banging continues. The door is about to shatter.\n\n\u201cListen, I know it\u2019s company policy and all that,\u201d you write, desperately. \u201cBut could you just do this as an off-the-radar kind of thing? I really regret agreeing to those terms and conditions.\u201d\n\nThere is a pause. Then you see Stephanie typing.\n\n\u201cAlright, here. All you have to do is reset the cookies on your browser.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? And the real cookies will stop coming?\u201d you ask hurriedly.\n\n\u201cCorrect.\u201d\n\nYou take a second to go to your browser settings, tapping \u201creset\u201d and watching the screen reload.\n\nAt once, the loud banging on the front door stops and everything becomes silent once again. The four paper bags on the kitchen counter are still there, but you understand that that\u2019s because you *accepted* them and brought them inside so they\u2019re already yours. You go to the front door and, very slowly, open it. There are no bags on the doorstep. You look back at your phone. There\u2019s a message from Stephanie.\n\n\u201cDid it work?\u201d\n\nYou type. \u201cLike a charm. Thanks so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Stephanie says. \u201cIs there anything else I can assist you with today?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you,\u201d you write, feeling a twinge of sadness. You wish you could say more to this person who\u2019s in an unknown location perhaps thousands of miles away and whose first name might not even be Stephanie, that helped you when you needed help \u2014 unlike that useless bot.\n\n\u201cWell then, I would like to wish you a happy holiday season. Thank you for contacting us.\u201d\n\nThe chat closes and it\u2019s asking you once again to give a number from a scale of 1 to 10. You smile brightly as you type \u201c11\u201d and press \u201csend\u201d. You go over to one of the bags sitting on your kitchen counter, reach in, pull out a cookie and take a bite. It\u2019s still warm and delicious and it still reminds you of your grandma. *Hm.

One morning, it could be a particularly sunny day in the Philippines. The air molecules liked the warm weather as much as the rest of us and decided to spend the day being particularly active.

I think that one's getting smaller.\" Jacob pointed at one of the slugs.\n\n\"I think it just entered a crack,\" Franklin replied. The slug moved away from the pit, and it continued its size. One of the slugs was moving back and forth in the ground. As it did so, the ground revealed trash underneath it. The slug absorbed the trash into its body allowing it to grow.\n\n\"Great, we might have to wait for the entire landfill to be destroyed,\" Jacob said.\n\n\"Or when mom kills one,\" Franklin said.

Enjoy!!  Win :-)  [winroberts.com](https://winroberts.com)\n\nMonstrous Ailment\n\n\n\nHis visage in the mirror was off somehow.  His eyes were bloodshot, but that didn\u2019t seem too unnatural.  The furrows in his brow, while pronounced and deep, weren\u2019t that much deviated from the norm.  His pallor was a chalky gray, which to his eye seemed a little chalkier than usual.  He stuck out his tongue: blue and swollen.  Finding this definite sign of illness, he donned his outer cloak and thick boots and headed for the Emergency Room.\t  \n  \nThe night was cold and a drizzle had started.  He pulled his coat collar tight around his neck, in an attempt to keep more of his body warmth in the inside of the garment.  The drizzle was damp-ening the fabric, and slowly the moisture penetrated through the coat and his shirt onto his skin.  This wouldn\u2019t help whatever was wrong with him, he figured.  He shivered and kept walking.  \n  \nFinally, at the ER he strode to the counter and waited pa-tiently for the nurse to acknowledge him.  He wouldn\u2019t wait long.  The angel of mercy behind the counter shoved a clipboard his way and uttered, \u201cFill this out.\u201d  He took the board, with its pen at-tached, and headed for an open seat in the waiting area.  \n  \nThe ER wasn\u2019t full tonight, but it was full enough to see that he looked ill enough for people to choose the seats farthest away from him.  A little boy sat next to him, only to have his mother whisk him away to generally recognized ER waiting room safety.  He didn\u2019t mind; he must look a fright with his ashen pallor and blue tongue.  \n  \nThe form wanted some personal information.  The first line wanted his name, and provided those willingly:  \n  \nLast name:  Stein  \n  \nFirst name:  Frank  \n  \nMiddle Initial:  N\n\nThe rest of the document featured questions he either didn\u2019t under-stand or they didn\u2019t seem to apply. They asked for something called a Social Security Number.  He figured that one person alone wasn\u2019t very comforting but that if a man had a friend to talk to then life could be very secure indeed.  He put a \u20182\u2019 for that.\n\nThe question arose about something called health insurance.  He didn\u2019t think he had any of that so he left it blank.  In addition, there were a lot of other queries about health history, but this being his first illness, he didn\u2019t know if that applied.  He left this blank also.  Feeling he\u2019d complied as best he could with the nurse\u2019s ques-tionnaire, he turned in his clipboard and waited to be called.  He didn\u2019t have to wait long.  \n  \n\u201cMr. Stein.\u201d  The nurse called out to the crowd in the wait-ing room.  \n  \nFrank rose from his chair and approached the counter thrilled at his luck in having gotten in so fast.  \n  \n\u201cMr. Stein.\u201d  The nurse looked up at him above her glasses that she perched at the very end of her nose.  \u201cYou don\u2019t have any health insurance?\u201d  \n  \nThe question hit Frank as odd.  He guessed the health insur-ance was more important than he had thought.   \u201cUmmm, no.\u201d  \n  \nThe nurse let out a sigh of exasperation, as if this wasn\u2019t the first time she had had to deal with this issue.  \u201cYou need to go to the free clinic across town.\u201d  She shuffled through some papers and produced a flyer describing the clinic, its purpose and its location.  Frank took the flyer and slowly, persistently read the information.  \n  \nIt seemed to him that folks not possessing the health insur-ance had to be treated at the free clinic, and so it being the case that he had none, he would have to go there.  That seemed obvious.  That seemed like his fate, even though he was loathe to make the journey.  \n  \nHe left the ER and started walking.  The drizzle had now turned to outright rain.  His clothes were soaked, so no turning of the collar or pulling the coat over his head would help his situation.  He trudged on in silent suffering.  \n\nA taxi cab rolled by him on the street, and hailing the driver as best he could, he failed to flag him down.  As a matter of fact, the look the driver gave him made him feel that his illness may be progressing more rapidly; that his appearance may not inspire con-fidence in his fellows.\n\nHe had been worried for a while now that he might not be acceptable to society in general:  that he may be some kind of misfit, some kind of pariah.  But then he thought that there were so many apocalyptic movies, where infection had caused the destruction of society.  Fear of contagion was in the communal psyche.  That was the reason for his shunning, he told himself.  It was the illness.\n\nAfter hours of walking he arrived at the free clinic, chilled to his very bones.  The nurse behind this counter gave him a similar clipboard full of similar questions to the ones he\u2019d answered before.  Being more experienced in the filling out of medical forms now, he raced through this one and returned it.\n\nThe waiting room here was more crowded than the other had been.  There were several seriously injured and ill people here.  He would gladly wait if those that were in urgent need could be helped first.  He also didn\u2019t mind waiting, as the temperature in the room was nice and toasty.  It wasn\u2019t long before his teeth stopped chattering and he could nap a bit.\n\nHe was awakened by a nurse bursting through the double doors at the end of the room and shouting, \u201cStein!\u201d\n\nHe leapt to his feet and followed the nurse to a bed with a curtain pulled around it.\n\n\u201cTake off all you clothes and put this on.\u201d  The nurse hand-ed him a gown.\n\nHe was glad to remove his sodden clothing.  He draped his clothes on the back of the chair located beside the bed.  He unfold-ed the gown he had been given, and immediately noticed that it was not going to cover his 8 foot frame.   He was even going to have trouble getting his arms through the arm holes.  He decided finally to opt for tying the garment around his waist to hide his \u2018privates\u2019.  He didn\u2019t want to scare any children that might be lin-gering about.\n\nHe plopped himself onto the bed with his feet dangling over the end of the bed.  He pulled the blanket up over his knees to just under his chin.  It wasn\u2019t long and a doctor pulled back his curtain and introduced himself.\n\n\u201cHello Mr. Stein.  I am Doctor Shoemaker.\u201d\n\n\u201cUmmm. Hi.\u201d  Frank rarely started any conversation with-out an \u2018Ummm\u2019 to begin.\n\n\u201cNow what seems to be the problem?\u201d  \n  \nFrank conveyed to the doctor his feelings of lethargy, his unnatural pallor and his tongue.  The doctor quickly got out a tongue depressor and one of those teeny flashlights they use to look at your head and began to probe and prod the patient patient.    \n  \n\u201cNow, what explains these bolts on your neck?\u201d  \n  \nFrank thought that was obvious.  \u201cUmmm, hold head on body.\u201d  \n  \n\u201cHmm, I noticed from the nurse\u2019s notes that you have a body temperature of 82 degrees.  Is that normal for you?\u201d  \n  \n\u201cUmmm, Frank guess so.\u201d\n\nThe doctor scratched his head and making a few notes in the chart vacated the ersatz room.\n\nFrank didn\u2019t have to wait long.  The doctor came back into his curtained sanctuary bringing a convoy of other doctors and res-idents.  The group talked in subdued whispers, with one or the oth-er taking a break to listen to Frank\u2019s heart or take a pulse.  Finally Dr. Shoemaker spoke.  \n  \n\u201cMr. Stein.  We\u2019re not sure how to treat you.  As far as we can tell, you should be dead. Even further, we think you may al-ready be dead.\u201d  \n  \nFrank didn\u2019t like this diagnosis.  It was obvious to him that he wasn\u2019t dead and if these quacks didn\u2019t know that, how in the world were they going to heal him.  It was time for him to go.  \n  \n\u201cUmmm, me go.\u201d  \n  \nFrank donned his wet clothes and made his way out of the clinic and headed home.  \n  \nFinally at home, Frank decided that what he really needed; what could not possibly hurt was a nice hot bath.  He climbed the flight of stairs to his bathroom and ran the water.  The water was running nice and steamy.  It wasn\u2019t long before the entire bathroom was filled in a cloud of health giving fog.  \n  \n\u2018Ummm, make better with TV!\u2019  Frank thought to himself.  He rummaged through the hall closet and finding an extension cord there, ran the power from his bedroom into the bathroom.  A visit to his bedroom produced a small TV he used on occasion to help fall asleep, which he positioned on the bathroom vanity.  \n  \nFrank threw his wet clothes into the hallway.  He\u2019d put them in the dryer later.  It was time for comfort, and so dialing the TV to a rerun of the Honeymooners, Frank slowly, carefully low-ered himself into the hot bath.  Water spilled everywhere over the sides of the tub.  The modern bathtub was small indeed but it was exceedingly too small for Frank.  He placed his feet on the wall where the faucet lived, and his head rested on the wall opposite.  \n  \nJackie Gleason was in rare form in this episode.  He was so mean to everyone, but he had such a big heart behind that.  Ed Norton entered the scene and was teaching Ralph Cramden how to play golf with his usual joie de vivre.  Ralph lost his temper and flailed at his TV friend.  Frank found this so amusing he convulsed with laughter.  The convulsion was his undoing, however, he knocked the vanity so hard with his foot, the TV teetered over the edge and then into his lap in the tub.  \n  \nA short shower of lightning sparks filled the bathroom and then nothing but silence and blackness in the whole house.  \n  \nThe sun was just coming up over the horizon when the rain stopped.  Inside this one particular house sat one particular man with a TV on his lap.  His eyes were closed; his body limp.  Sudden-ly, as if reborn, the man gasped for air, filling his lungs with the life giving oxygen.  He sat upright.  What had happened?  \n  \nHe pulled himself out of the tub, and going to the mirror, wiped the condensation from the glass to get a better look.  What he saw delighted him.  There in the mirror was a man with admit-tedly hair standing on end, and black char marks on his flesh, but his skin!  His skin had assumed its normal greyish hue.  He stuck out his tongue.  I was a bright green again, and the small pink pus-tules were back with the fine little hairs on them!  He admired what to him was a very handsome man in the mirror.\n\nThe bath had given him the jolt he needed.  He was ready to rejoin polite society.  His illness gone, he would be accepted for sure this time.\n\n", "index": "red11_s8_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red11_s8_c0_", "comment_text": "One from Churlish Tales.  Enjoy!!  Win :-)  [winroberts.com](https://winroberts.com)\n\nMonstrous Ailment\n\n\n\nHis visage in the mirror was off somehow.  His eyes were bloodshot, but that didn\u2019t seem too unnatural.  The furrows in his brow, while pronounced and deep, weren\u2019t that much deviated from the norm.  His pallor was a chalky gray, which to his eye seemed a little chalkier than usual.  He stuck out his tongue: blue and swollen.  Finding this definite sign of illness, he donned his outer cloak and thick boots and headed for the Emergency Room.\t  \n  \nThe night was cold and a drizzle had started.  He pulled his coat collar tight around his neck, in an attempt to keep more of his body warmth in the inside of the garment.  The drizzle was damp-ening the fabric, and slowly the moisture penetrated through the coat and his shirt onto his skin.  This wouldn\u2019t help whatever was wrong with him, he figured.  He shivered and kept walking.  \n  \nFinally, at the ER he strode to the counter and waited pa-tiently for the nurse to acknowledge him.  He wouldn\u2019t wait long.  The angel of mercy behind the counter shoved a clipboard his way and uttered, \u201cFill this out.\u201d  He took the board, with its pen at-tached, and headed for an open seat in the waiting area.  \n  \nThe ER wasn\u2019t full tonight, but it was full enough to see that he looked ill enough for people to choose the seats farthest away from him.

Or was reality turning into a scary movie I couldn't shake off? It was more like  \nliving in a dream that wouldn't let go, or maybe a nightmare that was too real to ignore.\n\nFor days now, I've had this feeling, like something dark and twisted was lurking inside me,  \nplaying tricks on my mind. Going to bed had become a struggle. I couldn't tell what was real and  \nwhat was a dream anymore.\n\nAfter I turned off the lights, I'd catch myself doing strange things, like pointing all five fingers of  \nmy hands at the window clinching the open fingers into a closed tight fist in angriness, or smiling  \nin a creepy and evilish way and messed-up thoughts that made me feel like I was going crazy.\n\nIt was freaking me out. I blamed it on my fatigue and tiredness from dealing with people,  \nespecially a lot during these days at the office, and I was sort of ignorant about it, but deep down,  \nI knew something wasn't right.\n\nSo, today, like always, after getting home, I took a quick nap, had dinner, did the dishes, and  \nworked on a report for a course I have taken as a part of the goal associated with my company.\n\nI planned to do more work, but I was too tired as my eyes were on the verge of giving up. So, I  \ndecided to finish it in the morning and went to bed. I used my phone for a while until I was nearly  \nasleep. Half my eyes closed, I put my phone to charge and went to sleep.\n\nIt was around midnight 01:00 to 01:30, I regained my consciousness. I couldn't move, and it felt  \nlike I was floating in the middle of my room, unable to open my eyes.\n\nMoments later, I realize someone or something like a black shadow is carrying me and making  \nrounds of the room like some kid wanting to be an airplane. I couldn't see it, but I could feel its  \ncold touch.\n\nA rush of fear flooded through me, making it hard to breathe and causing sharp pains in my  \nchest. So, I forcibly tried opening my eyes, but I couldn't. It was as if my eyelashes were glued  \nagainst my skin and they wouldn\u2019t budge.\n\nI tried to scream, to move my arms and feet, but I was frozen in place between his arms still  \nfloating. But, somehow I did manage to shout out \u201cmum\u201d out of desperation, and whatever it  \nwas, it kinda freaked out and dropped me back onto my bed.\n\nBut, there was a quilt on one side of the bed so my whole body didn't fit in the bed, and my right  \nleg was left hanging off the edge.\n\nAnd the moment I stopped feeling its sinister touch, I could open my eyes. I went into a state of  \nshock for seconds to find myself in the exact same position it had kept me in, which I thought  \nwas a part of the dream.\n\nI lay there, trembling and disoriented, trying to make sense of what had just happened. I didn't  \nmove for what felt like forever, too scared to even breathe. Eventually, I gathered some courage,  \ngot up, and turned on the lights, but I couldn't bring myself to sleep again.\n\nBut the horror was far from over\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t want to go to sleep, the long hectic day of tomorrow wanted me to get some  \nrest. So, I decided to leave a small light on and tried to sleep. Even though I was scared,  \nexhaustion won, and I drifted off.\n\nBut then, I woke up again.\n\nIt felt really weird as the room was pitch black even though I remember turning the lights on  \nbefore going to bed. I fumbled for my phone but couldn't find it. That's when I realized I wasn't in  \nmy room anymore.\n\nIt wasn't even the bed where I was sleeping but the floor of my brother's room, where he had  \nslept a few days back because we had guests in our home.\n\nI have never sleepwalked in my entire life, and I have no idea how I did it today, or if it was really  \nsleepwalk that I did, which led me to his room on the floor.\n\nI panicked again and froze there for a moment!\n\nBut then my instincts had me quickly turn on the lights, and I went back to my room closing the  \ndoor to his room without looking back, but I was so much affected by two horrific incidents that I  \ncouldn\u2019t bring myself to sleep again.\n\nI stayed up all night thinking about what had conspired until it was five in the morning. After  \nseeing some morning light, I tried going back to sleep thinking that the shadows could not haunt  \nme in the presence of light, and thankfully I got a good 2-hour nap.\n\nBut, even after I woke up, the fear lingered, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something evil  \nwas lurking in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike again.", "index": "red11_s9_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red11_s9_c0_", "comment_text": "Was I dreaming?

But, somehow I did manage to shout out \u201cmum\u201d out of desperation, and whatever it  \nwas, it kinda freaked out and dropped me back onto my bed.\n\nBut, there was a quilt on one side of the bed so my whole body didn't fit in the bed, and my right  \nleg was left hanging off the edge.\n\nAnd the moment I stopped feeling its sinister touch, I could open my eyes. I went into a state of  \nshock for seconds to find myself in the exact same position it had kept me in, which I thought  \nwas a part of the dream.\n\nI lay there, trembling and disoriented, trying to make sense of what had just happened. I didn't  \nmove for what felt like forever, too scared to even breathe. Eventually, I gathered some courage,  \ngot up, and turned on the lights, but I couldn't bring myself to sleep again.\n\nBut the horror was far from over\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t want to go to sleep, the long hectic day of tomorrow wanted me to get some  \nrest. So, I decided to leave a small light on and tried to sleep. Even though I was scared,  \nexhaustion won, and I drifted off.\n\nBut then, I woke up again.\n\nIt felt really weird as the room was pitch black even though I remember turning the lights on  \nbefore going to bed. I fumbled for my phone but couldn't find it. That's when I realized I wasn't in  \nmy room anymore.\n\nIt wasn't even the bed where I was sleeping but the floor of my brother's room, where he had  \nslept a few days back because we had guests in our home.\n\nI have never sleepwalked in my entire life, and I have no idea how I did it today, or if it was really  \nsleepwalk that I did, which led me to his room on the floor.\n\nI panicked again and froze there for a moment!\n\nBut then my instincts had me quickly turn on the lights, and I went back to my room closing the  \ndoor to his room without looking back, but I was so much affected by two horrific incidents that I  \ncouldn\u2019t bring myself to sleep again.\n\nI stayed up all night thinking about what had conspired until it was five in the morning. After  \nseeing some morning light, I tried going back to sleep thinking that the shadows could not haunt  \nme in the presence of light, and thankfully I got a good 2-hour nap.\n\nBut, even after I woke up, the fear lingered, and I couldn't shake the feeling that something evil  \nwas lurking in the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike again.", "comment_created_utc": 1714404593.0, "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

Orin Zack\n\n[2003]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChapter Fifteen\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven before he reached the jury room, Frank could tell that John, the news editor half of the tag team, was upset. Several voices were involved in the harangue, but his was by far the most strident. To get a sense of the group, he paused outside the door to listen.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d John said, derisively, \u201cI know what Frank told us, Rick. I also know how it\u2019ll be reported in the press if anything about this mess ever gets out. What we all agreed to was simply to say nothing about Frank\u2019s own indiscretion, to allow him to collect evidence for us; not to become active participants in what counsel just called an act of terrorism!\u201d\n\nRick, the foreman, dropped his fist. \u201cI said, until we have proof, we\u2019re not going to assume that Frank had anything to do with\u2014\u201d\n\nFrank opened the door. They all turned to look. \u201cI did, but it wasn\u2019t terrorism. It was a rescue.\u201d\n\nNobody said a word until he\u2019d shut the door behind him and took a seat. Then, when Sala, the apprentice, realized that they were all silently deferring to her, she nodded, and looked intently at Frank. \u201cI think you owe us all an explanation.\u201d\n\nBefore Frank had a chance to say anything, Peter crossed his arms and cleared his throat.\n\nFrank took a breath. \u201cAs Peter probably told you, we arranged for Dr. Apu\u00e9rto to be transferred to K\u00fcbler-Ross Hospice Center once we discovered that it wasn\u2019t going to happen otherwise.\u201d\n\nRick drummed his fingers on the table. \u201c \u2018We\u2019? Who else is involved in this now?\u201d\n\nFrank started ticking them off on his fingers. \u201cWell, besides Peter and me, there\u2019s Cynthia Thedik, a former Healer from Australia who\u2019s been tracking these people for some time now, and a guy named Lenny. He\u2019s the ringleader of the demonstrators outside the courthouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, Lenny was recruited by this government agency a while back,\u201d Peter added, \u201cbut ditched out during training, so they messed with his head to prevent him from ratting on them. Well, anyway, that means he can\u2019t remember anything about it, and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWould the two of you please be quiet,\u201d Sala said. \u201cYou\u2019re both off topic. Healer Sanroya, since you may have implicated us all in something far beyond what we agreed to, I think we need to know everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike Peter said,\u201d he began, \u201cwhen we learned that East-Side wasn\u2019t going to transfer Dr. Apu\u00e9rto, we arranged to have him transferred.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 broke into the MedCenter?\u201d John probed.\n\nHe looked at Peter. \u201cNo, into the place where Peter works.\u201d\n\nJohn flattened his hand. \u201cWhy there?\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy access to the MedCenter\u2019s information systems. Once inside their security layer, Lenny, the demonstrator I mentioned, logged a transfer request for Saturday night.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like that?\u201d Sala said. \u201cWhy would they comply? Wouldn\u2019t anyone notice? I would imagine they would be pretty concerned about the well-being of their own administrator.\u201d\n\nFrank smiled. \u201cLike Apu\u00e9rto told the court, their operation is based on the assumption that the data is correct. Nobody questioned the transfer order simply because it was in their system. And as to them not noticing, Peter set up a phony MedNet data feed to make it look like he was really still there.\u201d\n\nRick sighed. \u201cSo Peter violated security at his workplace in order for Lenny to violate security at the MedCenter. And to top that off, you had Peter commit an even bigger felony by tampering with the MedNet. Nice plan. Too bad it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should have,\u201d Frank said. \u201cUnfortunately, the man we\u2019re trying to flush out \u2013 and he\u2019s in the courtroom, by the way \u2013 has some pretty nasty friends, one of whom was responsible for what happened to me in court this morning.\u201d\n\nSala looked at him for a moment. \u201cWhat did happen? And where did you go off to just now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was attacked, and so was Apu\u00e9rto.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttacked?\u201d John echoed sharply. \u201cBy who? I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the guy we\u2019re after attacked Dr. Apu\u00e9rto. One of his friends \u2013 the man who helped solve my neural problem \u2013 attacked me, or rather he triggered the energy sprite I was carrying around to attack me.\u201d\n\nRick pushed back from the table. \u201cEnergy sprite?\u201d\n\nFrank shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s gone now. That\u2019s where I was. Cynthia got rid of it for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Dr. Apu\u00e9rto?\u201d Sala said. \u201cWhat about him? You said he was attacked as well?\u201d\n\nFrank was uncertain how to handle this aspect of the situation. After all, it defied nouny logic, and that undergirded the universe they were supposed to inhabit here. \u201cSomehow, our guy has a way to mess with reality,\u201d he said, watching for reactions. \u201cWhen Dr. Apu\u00e9rto was struggling to recall where his consultant came from, I saw something really strange inside his mind. It was as if someone was trying to swap our witness for one who didn\u2019t know what was going on, like an oblivious dream version of him was about to take over his waking life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d John said thoughtfully, \u201cwe must be getting very close to whatever this guy is desperate to protect.\u201d\n\nFrank nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold on a minute,\u201d Peter said suddenly. \u201cBefore we get into that, there\u2019s still the matter of what happened out in the flyway. You said it was a rescue?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. We don\u2019t know how he does it, but apparently whomever this guy works for, he has a way to cause improbable \u2013 even impossible things to happen. En route to K\u00fcbler-Ross, the MedCenter transport was nearly smashed by an out-of-control cargo unit. Only it was out-of-control directly at them, and their safeties conveniently failed. We forced them to ground, and then took Apu\u00e9rto somewhere safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere,\u201d Sala said, \u201cyou presumably did that probing you wanted to do?\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cAnd once we told him what we knew, that his facility was being used by someone, he couldn\u2019t wait to get back to court and flush him out.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cThat explains his dramatic entrance, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d John said evenly, looking around the table, \u201cthe only way to come out of this mess unscathed is to control the situation. The news people, even the ones I work with, are going to want to play up the emotional triggers, because that\u2019s what gets them attention. They\u2019re used to inflating minor scuffles into weeklong scandals, but this time they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re dealing with. Fortunately, we do, and that\u2019s our advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI may be able to point out the guy behind all this, but I don\u2019t know who he is, or what organization is behind him. Apu\u00e9rto was trying to identify which government agency was involved, and you saw the trouble that caused.\u201d\n\nSala had just opened her mouth to speak, when there was a knock at the door, and a bailiff poked his head in.\n\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut since the witness has recovered from his panic attack, Judge Bennigan would like you all to return to the courtroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her we\u2019re not ready,\u201d John said suddenly.\n\nRick held up his hand to stop the bailiff, and looked at John. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nThe bailiff stepped in and shut the door.\n\nJohn thought for a moment. \u201cI told you we had to control the situation. When the GD gave juries the ability to ask questions, it also set things up to discourage them from doing so. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, Rick, but that\u2019s how those of you in the Blue affect most citizen jurors. In any case, we\u2019ve got a nasty situation here, and the only way out of it is to use the rules to our benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Sala said. \u201cThe rules do allow us to decide when we\u2019re ready. The court can wait.\u201d\n\nRick shrugged. \u201cOkay, then they\u2019ll wait.\u201d He nodded to the bailiff.\n\nThe bailiff chuckled as he closed the door. \u201cThis should be interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat minor act of rebellion,\u201d John continued, \u201ctook control of the process away from the judge and both sides\u2019 counsel. Everyone will naturally assume that we have learned something of supreme importance to the case, and that will shift attention from the questions asked by counsel to those asked by us. It\u2019ll also put everyone off their game.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Rick said agreeably. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve turned this case into theatre, what\u2019s the story and the staging?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll handle story,\u201d John said conspiratorially, \u201cyou\u2019ve got more experience with staging.\u201d He paused to glance at the others. \u201cWe know that behind the events posited in this case is a scheme that has some purpose other than simply making money for two corporations. We know that the person behind this didn\u2019t want to be exposed, and was willing to go to extreme lengths to protect that secret. Frank says that he\u2019s in court, and that Apu\u00e9rto now knows who he is as well. Rick?\u201d\n\nThe foreman scratched his head briefly. \u201cIf I were him, I certainly wouldn\u2019t want any spotlight on me. So perhaps we should do what we can to make him nervous. Having us all stare at him would be too obvious, and might disrupt the proceedings, so instead, how about everyone just occasionally glance at him. When we get back inside, Frank, make a note of where he\u2019s sitting. I\u2019ll put it on everyone\u2019s display.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I should warn you all about,\u201d Frank said uncomfortably. \u201cSince the sprite was removed, I might have another attack, and I don\u2019t know how bad it might be.\u201d\n\nRick shrugged. \u201cHey, it\u2019s theatre. We\u2019ll ad lib.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about that bluff?\u201d Peter said. \u201cI mean making everyone think we know something is all well and good, but what if we have to back it up? What happens then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ought to take care of itself,\u201d John said. \u201cWhen people are nervous, and suggesting that we know something will have that effect, they make mistakes, they give clues to what they don\u2019t want to come out. That\u2019s what we all have to be alert for. So when the case resumes, pay special attention to body language. If someone\u2019s posture or expression looks forced or faked, whatever they\u2019re saying isn\u2019t what they\u2019re thinking. Those are the details that will break this thing open for us.\u201d\n\nSala laughed. \u201cYou have an interesting laboratory technique.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Rick said, sitting back in his seat, \u201cI guess we\u2019re ready now.\u201d\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll eyes were on the jury from the moment Rick\u2019s powder-blue suit first caught the fluorescing light of the overhead glowtubes. Eight people quietly and purposefully walked to the jury box without returning even one of the curious stares from around the room. They were on a mission, and wanted everyone to know it. None of them sat until all were by their seats, standing straight and still. Then, a moment after the foreman sat down, the others followed suit.\n\nWhile Judge Bennigan reminded the spectators to hold their tongues, Frank scanned their ranks for their adversary and his two confederates. For whatever reason, they were no longer seated together in the middle of the second row of seats. Their ringleader had moved to the first row, directly behind the Respondent\u2019s table, while Carlita Guti\u00e9rez and Allan Wylie now sat in the back row behind the closer Complainant\u2019s table. But what was perhaps more interesting to Frank was that Alex had chosen the farthest seat on the front row, and Mara the closest seat on the rear one. He noted their mark\u2019s position for the others, and sat back to wait for the first witness to be called.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\u201d Counsel for the Complainant said, rising from his seat, \u201cI apologize for the confusion caused this morning by permitting Dr. Apu\u00e9rto to continue his testimony so soon after his apparent recovery. Fortunately, he is reported to be in good health.\u201d He walked to the witness box. \u201cWe would now like to continue with the witness that we had originally planned to question this morning, Dr. Meridyth Glacksd\u00f3ttir, Administrator of the Dartmouth MedCenter in Halifax.\u201d\n\nFrank immediately looked at Alex. Dartmouth was where Uru G\u2019danic had been taken after his accident, and where, according to Mara, he\u2019d been killed. If this administrator knew anything about that, or about any other suspicious goings-on, he was determined to find it.\n\nThe door opened, and a bailiff ushered in a woman whose age he couldn\u2019t gauge, and whose face suggested a mix of Icelandic, Black and Native American blood. She paused momentarily as she entered to glance around the room, and then continued to the witness box, where she was sworn in and took her seat.\n\nFrank glanced down at his display, and was relieved to find that she\u2019d agreed to submit to link during her testimony. He was curious, however, about what kind of inner world a person with her background might have.\n\n\u201cThe court,\u201d Counsel began, \u201chas been exploring how staff and management at facilities operated by HealthTech Resources determine what to do when a patient is brought in for evaluation\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile the witness was given the background for the questions to come, Frank closed his eyes and reached towards the witness\u2019 personal space, in preparation for establishing a link. Surprisingly, her energy field neither offered resistance nor deferred to intrusions, as Apu\u00e9rto\u2019s had. Instead, it enfolded his presence, welcoming him as a guest, while at the same time being sure of its own integrity. Frank was intrigued.\n\n\u201c\u2026according to Dr. Migu\u00e9l Apu\u00e9rto, Administrator of the East-Side MedCenter, here in Los Angeles, from an agency of the Global Directorate.\u201d Counsel paused briefly. \u201cFurther, he explained to the court that this same agency supplied guidance in jurisdictional matters, in the form of a consultant. Is this also the case at your facility?\u201d\n\nIn the seconds before Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir spoke, Frank watched a stream of memories slide through her mind. Unlike those he\u2019d shared in the other witnesses, her memories seemed to fade into one another, instead of being represented as discrete bits floating in a field of darkness. This fluidity meant that the inner world she\u2019d developed was significantly different from that of the other witnesses to this case. In fact, it hinted at an inner reality that might transcend the limits of nouny or verby langscapes much as G\u2019danic transcended worldviews.\n\n\u201cYes, it is,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes, just as some of a patient\u2019s symptoms may be more subtle than others, the importance of taking extreme steps to preserve a patient\u2019s life may not be apparent to anyone concerned primarily with their immediate health.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy this,\u201d Counsel said slowly, \u201cdo you mean political considerations?\u201d\n\nWhen she agreed, Frank was treated to a succession of memories, each a mix of sensory recall and the tactile shadow of a subterranean process that she associated with each of the public figures at the center of the memory. Clearly, at least part of her world was quite verby, but it was really more a hybrid.\n\n\u201cThe reason for this,\u201d she said, \u201cwas that the dynamics in which these people are often embedded have far-reaching implications. By preserving their lives in BioStabilization, it became possible to extend the time needed to work out acceptable solutions to the problems caused by their having been injured, and which would be triggered the moment they were to die. That is why the GD\u2019s peacekeeping agency provides a portion of the funding for these facilities.\u201d\n\nAs the thought of the peacekeeping agency flew through the witness\u2019 mind, Frank broke away from her stream of associations, dropped the link, and looked past the Counsel to find their adversary fidgeting uncomfortably. A few seats away, Alex was watching him as well. They had another piece of the puzzle: as Lenny\u2019s conspiracy sheet had suggested, the government was responsible. But they needed more information, and a way to direct the questioning where they wanted it to go, so he pressed the sidebar button to note the comment for later, and closed his eyes again.\n\nEthics had long since ceased to be an issue in this matter, but it still bothered Frank that what he now contemplated doing violated not only his oath to the jury and the Healer\u2019s Oath, but the whole sacred process of legal trials as well. He thought about Peter\u2019s book, and of the changes that had transformed what trials were about and how they worked over the centuries. He wondered what would happen to him if this next act was detected, and of how that would affect Mara and Pegwin. And then he thought about what would happen if he didn\u2019t. After this crisis was over, assuming that he survived it, he was going to have to take a good long look at what he\u2019d done, why, and how he felt about it. Right now, what they needed was a hook, information offered by the witness that they could use later as a means to probe deeper. Just mentioning that such things happened wasn\u2019t enough; they needed an example, because that would permit them to request a counter-example, and thereby get to the heart of this so-called advice.\n\nThis time, when Frank reached out psychically, it wasn\u2019t to link with the witness, but rather to the Counsel standing before her. In one smooth insubstantial motion, he pushed through the man\u2019s energy field, dove into the energy knot of consciousness, and planted a suggestion. Then he retreated. He wasn\u2019t pleased with himself, not one bit. But he knew it had to be done, that it served a greater need for justice, and that, at least, made it sting a bit less.\n\n\u201cOne more question, Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir,\u201d Counsel for the Complainant said, halfway to his seat, and turned back to face her. \u201cIf, as you have said, considering political issues is this important when choosing how to treat a patient, would you please give the court an example, so that we can understand the value of this advice?\u201d\n\nFrank looked at their adversary. He didn\u2019t see much point in monitoring the answer to this question, because it wouldn\u2019t tell them anything anyway. As far as the case was concerned, however, evidence of non-medical personnel, regardless of whether they were from the government or an insurance company, being involved in making medical decisions was enough to prove that the process had been corrupted. That made it suspect, which supported the case against the two corporations. More importantly, it gave the jury an opening, and that made the man even more visibly nervous. And that, in turn, made Alex smile.\n\nAs it turned out, Frank\u2019s suggestion induced Counsel to ask several more questions after that one, but none of them led to what the jury was after. When Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir had satisfied the Counsel\u2019s sudden curiosity, he returned to his table and sat down.\n\nThis time, Rick didn\u2019t even have to say anything. When he raised his finger to interrupt the proceedings, Judge Bennigan dutifully gave him the floor.\n\nInstead of standing immediately, Rick sat for a moment, feigning deep thought and studying witness, counsel and adversary. By this time, the occasional glances of the jurors had started attracting the attention of other members of the crowd, who had begun looking across the room to discern what had so captured the jury\u2019s attention. Their target was now actively avoiding eye contact with them, which forced him into a constrained posture, the strain of which was beginning to show on his face.\n\nWhen Rick finally rose, the spectators quieted. \u201cThank you, Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir,\u201d he began, \u201cfor so carefully explaining to the court how valuable the BioStabilization technology is, both to your patients, and to the world at large.\u201d\n\nFrank had gotten so involved in the theatrics Rick was staging that he\u2019d forgotten to re-establish his link, so he closed his eyes and reached out again. Because the witness\u2019 attention had been directed to global issues, Frank first encountered a stream of memories drawn from news reports she\u2019d seen or read about various high-profile BSW patients.\n\n\u201cWe of the jury, however,\u201d Rick said, reinforcing the idea that they were now acting in concert, \u201care curious about the nature of this advice, as you\u2019ve described it, and your reaction to it. For example, have you or your staff ever acted in opposition to this advice? In other words, have you ever refused to place one of these important people into BioStabilization, even though your government advisor suggested that you do so?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cNo, sir. What would be the point of withholding the best possible care for a patient who had no other options?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, indeed.\u201d Rick glanced down at the other jurors. \u201cBut if you did, what would happen then? Would there be any repercussions?\u201d\n\nFrank wanted to ensure that their witness didn\u2019t suddenly lose her nerve, so he urged her on with a feeling of accomplishment.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said, a sudden touch of excitement in her voice.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs before, Angela was keeping an eye on things. This time, however, she was in the courtroom, and doing her best to not be noticed. From her seat near Mara, she could see that her nemesis had raised his right hand slightly. Recalling that he\u2019d held some small device each time he was seen to be translucent in Apu\u00e9rto\u2019s memories, she psychically goosed the woman to his right, forcing a reaction that knocked it from his grip.\n\nStartled and confused, the man bent down to reach for it, but when he saw how far the thing had slid, he sat back and clenched his teeth in frustration.\n\nA few seats to his left, Alex LeBlanc, looking very serious, began drumming his fingers on his thigh.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMomentarily startled by the sound of something metallic skittering across the floor, Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir took a breath and started over. \u201cAs with most agreements, there are obligations and responsibilities placed on each party. Since the BioStabilization equipment is underwritten partially by a grant from the GD, they do reserve the right to request special treatment for certain individuals.\u201d\n\nRick took a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re evading my question. What would happen if you refused this special treatment?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d she said contritely, \u201cwe could very likely have that funding removed, and with it the ability to help many other people with the same technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to turn the situation around. Has your GD advisor ever requested that you withhold BioStabilization treatment from someone?\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cAs a matter of fact, that happened just this past week.\u201d\n\nThe image of Uru G\u2019danic\u2019s face floated before Frank as it drifted across her mind. Grabbing the image, Frank dove into the memory that lay behind it.\n\n\u201cWould you please tell the court about that case?\u201d Rick said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to violate doctor-patient privacy rules, so you don\u2019t have to reveal the patient\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of our patients, a public figure, was brought in after a construction accident.\u201d A sudden gasp from the back of the room, followed by a wave of whispering, distracted her briefly. \u201cWe used the best of our conventional treatments,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut found that he reacted badly to them. Then, when we changed the regimen, his system had a massive breakdown. It was our opinion that we should over-ride the preferences in his MedNet profile and place him under BioStabilization until we could determine what to do, but we were advised not to, and, in the end, agreed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the patient?\u201d Rick asked. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died.\u201d\n\nThis time, the murmur was much louder, and had to be silenced by the judge.\n\nRick thought briefly. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that if it hadn\u2019t been for this advice, your staff would have ignored the man\u2019s MedNet request and placed him under BioStabilization. Is that correct?\u201d\n\nShe hesitated. \u201cTechnically yes, but without that funding, without their advisor, we also wouldn\u2019t have had the equipment, and would therefore not have been able to save his life anyway. If you follow the logic.\u201d\n\nDr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir\u2019s mention of logic released a torrent of related thoughts and memories. Because of the fluid nature of her inner reality, however, it also elicited a stream of incidents that seemed to defy nouny logic. As Frank watched them slither through her mind, it struck him that they were related to the reality shifts that Cynthia had told him about. In each case, the MedCenter Administrator had experienced something that didn\u2019t match what she recalled about some prior incident, an anomaly that most people would have casually written off to a faulty memory. Because her inner world allowed for such things, however, she\u2019d simply learned to live with them.\n\nTaking a closer look at some of these incidents, Frank realized that there was also a pattern to them. They all seemed to relate to patients about whom she had gotten advice from her government consultant. The one he was floating along with at the moment happened in her office, upon reading a report about a new BioStabilization patient, a man involved in some kind of mathematical research. According to the report, the mathematician\u2019s neural attractor patterns showed that there was no reaction to the neurochemical triggers that ought to have kept his amygdala in synch with the rest of his limbic system. Yet, according to all the published research, the subsequent cognitive meltdown that led to his being moved to BSW could never have happened. At least, that was how she remembered the research. But when she requested the paper, it was completely different, and when she contacted the researchers, they confirmed what she\u2019d just read.\n\nFrank searched her memory for what had brought the patient into Dartmouth MedCenter to begin with, and found that it had been a flyway incident. Recalling Apu\u00e9rto\u2019s aborted transfer to K\u00fcbler-Ross Hospice, the sudden sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that hit him at that moment was cut short when he read the patient\u2019s name: Vern Cuoku.\n\nSo Jerry was right. Jen\u2019s cousin had been murdered, and by someone working with the man now sitting a few seats from Alex. But what about Uru G\u2019danic? What did she know about him?\n\n\u201cForgive me for being blunt,\u201d Rick said, a bit taken aback, \u201cbut if you and your staff are willing to ignore the stated preferences in a patient\u2019s MedNet profile, what is the point of having one in the first place?\u201d\n\nWhile Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir recited the corporate litany about the difference between guidance and direction, Frank probed further in her memories. If she knew about G\u2019danic, then he ought to be able to draw it out with the same trick he used in Apu\u00e9rto. But before he\u2019d finished wrapping himself in a reflection of the witness\u2019s sense of self, his concentration was shattered by a searing headache, breaking the link and snapping him back to the more substantial reality of the courtroom.\n\nStruggling to open his migraine-blinded eyes against the glaringly bright light of the heavily diffused glowtubes, and clenching his jaw through short, painful breaths, Frank peered across the courtroom and looked into the self-satisfied face of the man who had caused so much trouble. Whoever he was, and whatever group was behind him, Frank was determined to stop him.\n\n\u201cFrank?\u201d Sala whispered beside him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\nHe gripped the arms of his chair and shakily pushed himself back in his seat. Clearly, the man had been psychically trained, and not by anyone interested in using the ability for therapeutic purposes. The attack had been focused directly on the point of most psychic leverage, for unless he could drive the distracting pain from his consciousness, he\u2019d be unable to strike back.\n\nA hole suddenly formed in the all-encompassing blast of pain that poked and prodded at his mind. \u2018Hang on, Frank,\u2019 Cynthia\u2019s voice echoed in his head.\n\nAs the area of relief grew wider, he jerked his head to the left to look at Cynthia, who was now sitting quite still, with her eyes closed and look of deep concentration on her face.\n\nWith Cynthia\u2019s protection, Frank quickly regained enough control of his situation to try striking back. But before closing his eyes to focus, he glanced a few seats to Cynthia\u2019s left, and returned Mara\u2019s worried look.\n\n\u201cThank you, Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir,\u201d Rick said.\n\nWhile Frank battled the psychic onslaught and pushed his enforced migraine away, Cynthia continued to provide protection. In a moment, he was again in control, and ready to retaliate.\n\n\u2018Together, now.\u2019 Cynthia\u2019s voice echoed in his mind.\n\nDrawing on all his pent up anger and frustrations, Frank felt for the stream of psi energy pushing at him from across the room, and reached through it to its source. This wouldn\u2019t be any covert link, but the most inexcusable misuse of his training imaginable. Some might be uncomfortable with the thought of having a Healer probe people\u2019s minds, to look into their memories, but that was nothing compared to what a skilled Healer was capable of doing. There had only been a handful of rogue Healers in the history of the profession, and everyone knew there was no humane way to stop them. He only hoped that he wouldn\u2019t be sucked into that deadly behavioral attractor, destroying whatever was left of his integrity in the consuming fire of power.\n\nBlinded to reason, he drove deep into the energy knot of the man\u2019s consciousness, searching for the single most vulnerable aspect of existence, the secret at the core of life itself, our connection to the greater awareness from which we arise, and to which we ultimately return. If the reason for our existence is the universe\u2019s lust for self-knowledge, then this is one lesson it wasn\u2019t going to get. If he could snap that connection, the man would be truly doomed, for his connection to every aspect of reality would be broken, and he\u2019d vanish from\u2014\n\n\u2018Frank, no!\u2019 Cynthia screamed in his mind.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d A voice echoed in the courtroom.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe sudden exclamation startled everyone but Alex, who had been watching the man intently. He slid his left foot forward, and turned to look across the two people separating him from the person he was now certain had caused Frank to slump in pain a moment before. As the courtroom lurched past murmur and flirted with uproar, some spectators turned to look at the source of the cry, others glanced apprehensively at judge and bailiffs, and a few craned to see the witness, who now wore a very distraught expression. Only Mara was steadfastly watching Frank, and she was halfway out of her seat. A few yards to her left, Cynthia shuddered spasmodically, with eyes closed and fists pressing into her thighs.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen Angela instinctively reached out to stop Frank, she, too pushed past their adversary\u2019s defenses, and then dove into the core of his consciousness. There was no careful way to do it, no crafty subterfuge to conceal her identity, just the horror of a raw psychic intrusion, and the hell with repercussions.\n\nIf she didn\u2019t stop Frank from what he now seemed intent on doing, he would be irretrievably lost to the destructive psychic attractor that lay like a black hole in the bright eye of their profession.\n\nIf he succeeded, he would not only destroy his own life, but cast the work of thousands of Healers over hundreds of years into a pit of distrust from which it might never return. The act was destructive enough by itself; doing it in open court, in full view of dozens of newshounds, however, could easily convince the GD to tear up the agreement at the heart of this case, shut down every single Hospice Center, and prohibit Healers from practicing anywhere.\n\nDesperate to save him from destruction, she wrapped herself around the flaming mass of energy that he was building within the man\u2019s field, and forced him to retreat, to pull the center of his awareness back across the room, where she could use her ability to shield inside-out, preventing him from linking with anyone, at least for now.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen Alex saw the man jerk again in his seat, he glanced at Frank, who was trembling as well. He rose and dove across the seats. In seconds he had pushed the inert man to the ground, and was beginning to pummel him. People on all sides stood to get out of the way, while both bailiffs rushed over and the judge gaveled for order. Now fully alert, the man struggled to escape. Almost immediately, bailiffs pulled the two apart and held them immobile.\n\nIt took the judge several strikes of her gavel to get enough people\u2019s attention that she could be heard. \u201cTake those two to separate detention rooms. We\u2019ll deal with them later.\u201d\n\nFrank turned to Sala, drew a few short breaths, and whispered, \u201cHe killed my friend, and I just nearly killed him. I need to get out of here.\u201d\n\nShe quickly typed a note for Rick, and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nOnce the bailiffs had removed the two combatants, Judge Bennigan again called for order. \u201cThis case certainly seems to attract its share of trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst Dr. Apu\u00e9rto\u2019s alleged attack by Healer Sanroya, then his flyway incident and miraculous recovery from who knows what, and now this. If this keeps up, I might have to declare this a closed court, just to safeguard the witnesses. Would both counsel please approach the bench.\u201d\n\nWhile the two lawyers were getting up, Rick raised a hand to interrupt. \u201cYour honor,\u201d he said, \u201cunder the circumstances, I suggest that we take a short recess, and give everyone a chance to calm down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a 10 minute recess.\u201d Then, looking at the two lawyers, she added, \u201cWould you two please join me in my office?\u201d\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs soon as the jury room door was closed, they dropped the veneer of formality and drew close to Frank.\n\n\u201cWhat happened out there?\u201d Sala asked.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter agreed.\n\nFrank held his hands up for some space, and collapsed into a nearby chair. \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d he said weakly.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Rick said, taking a seat, and motioning the others to follow suit.\n\nFrank looked over at Peter. \u201cWhen I was examining her memories, I discovered that Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir had noticed a reality shift. Whoever these people are, they killed the patient my friend Jerry was investigating \u2013 the one he\u2019d asked you to get some information about \u2013 but there\u2019s no way to prove it. None.\u201d\n\nSala sat as well. \u201cWhat happened to you, though? It seemed like you suddenly took ill out there.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her and shook his head. \u201cI was pushed actually. Our guy attacked me psychically. Fortunately, Cynthia was there to help.\u201d He glanced at several confused faces. \u201cFrom across the room. You know.\u201d\n\nThe others took seats, and leaned towards him.\n\n\u201cAnd that skirmish?\u201d John asked, ever alert for a news angle. \u201cWhat was that about? And who was that other guy? He looks familiar.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlex LeBlanc,\u201d Frank said. \u201cMy brother-in-law. I\u2019d told him that our mark was in the room, and he must have figured out who it was on his own.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me that you nearly killed him?\u201d Sala said quietly.\n\nHe nodded. \u201cI was so enraged, I just lost it.\u201d He stared at the table. \u201cI\u2019d intentionally blown into his mind, and was about to snuff him out, when Cynthia stopped me, pushed me back. I suppose the guy would have done the same to me, or worse, if Alex hadn\u2019t flattened him just then.\u201d\n\nThey were quiet for a few moments. Then Rick took a deep breath. \u201cWhat do you want to do? We can excuse you, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cThat might be for the best. I\u2019ve got my family to consider, and the way things are headed, my daughter could end up with a dead father. But I still want to get in to see him, to find out what all this is really about. Is there any way to do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re excused,\u201d Sala said, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason they\u2019d keep you out. After all, you might want to apologize for what your brother-in-law did. They ought to believe that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Frank said, \u201cbut what about the case? Won\u2019t you need me to\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Rick said. \u201cYou\u2019ve given us plenty to go on already.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n([TOC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gznork26/comments/1c4ue2f/deadly_attractor_table_of_contents/))", "index": "red11_s10_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red11_s10_c0_", "comment_text": "\u201cDeadly Attractor\u201d ([TOC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gznork26/comments/1c4ue2f/deadly_attractor_table_of_contents/))\n\nby P. Orin Zack\n\n[2003]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nChapter Fifteen\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEven before he reached the jury room, Frank could tell that John, the news editor half of the tag team, was upset. Several voices were involved in the harangue, but his was by far the most strident. To get a sense of the group, he paused outside the door to listen.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d John said, derisively, \u201cI know what Frank told us, Rick. I also know how it\u2019ll be reported in the press if anything about this mess ever gets out. What we all agreed to was simply to say nothing about Frank\u2019s own indiscretion, to allow him to collect evidence for us; not to become active participants in what counsel just called an act of terrorism!\u201d\n\nRick, the foreman, dropped his fist. \u201cI said, until we have proof, we\u2019re not going to assume that Frank had anything to do with\u2014\u201d\n\nFrank opened the door. They all turned to look. \u201cI did, but it wasn\u2019t terrorism. It was a rescue.\u201d\n\nNobody said a word until he\u2019d shut the door behind him and took a seat. Then, when Sala, the apprentice, realized that they were all silently deferring to her, she nodded, and looked intently at Frank. \u201cI think you owe us all an explanation.\u201d\n\nBefore Frank had a chance to say anything, Peter crossed his arms and cleared his throat.\n\nFrank took a breath. \u201cAs Peter probably told you, we arranged for Dr. Apu\u00e9rto to be transferred to K\u00fcbler-Ross Hospice Center once we discovered that it wasn\u2019t going to happen otherwise.\u201d\n\nRick drummed his fingers on the table. \u201c \u2018We\u2019? Who else is involved in this now?\u201d\n\nFrank started ticking them off on his fingers. \u201cWell, besides Peter and me, there\u2019s Cynthia Thedik, a former Healer from Australia who\u2019s been tracking these people for some time now, and a guy named Lenny. He\u2019s the ringleader of the demonstrators outside the courthouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, Lenny was recruited by this government agency a while back,\u201d Peter added, \u201cbut ditched out during training, so they messed with his head to prevent him from ratting on them. Well, anyway, that means he can\u2019t remember anything about it, and\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWould the two of you please be quiet,\u201d Sala said. \u201cYou\u2019re both off topic. Healer Sanroya, since you may have implicated us all in something far beyond what we agreed to, I think we need to know everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike Peter said,\u201d he began, \u201cwhen we learned that East-Side wasn\u2019t going to transfer Dr. Apu\u00e9rto, we arranged to have him transferred.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 broke into the MedCenter?\u201d John probed.\n\nHe looked at Peter. \u201cNo, into the place where Peter works.\u201d\n\nJohn flattened his hand. \u201cWhy there?\u201d\n\n\u201cEasy access to the MedCenter\u2019s information systems. Once inside their security layer, Lenny, the demonstrator I mentioned, logged a transfer request for Saturday night.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like that?\u201d Sala said. \u201cWhy would they comply? Wouldn\u2019t anyone notice? I would imagine they would be pretty concerned about the well-being of their own administrator.\u201d\n\nFrank smiled. \u201cLike Apu\u00e9rto told the court, their operation is based on the assumption that the data is correct. Nobody questioned the transfer order simply because it was in their system. And as to them not noticing, Peter set up a phony MedNet data feed to make it look like he was really still there.\u201d\n\nRick sighed. \u201cSo Peter violated security at his workplace in order for Lenny to violate security at the MedCenter. And to top that off, you had Peter commit an even bigger felony by tampering with the MedNet. Nice plan. Too bad it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should have,\u201d Frank said. \u201cUnfortunately, the man we\u2019re trying to flush out \u2013 and he\u2019s in the courtroom, by the way \u2013 has some pretty nasty friends, one of whom was responsible for what happened to me in court this morning.\u201d\n\nSala looked at him for a moment. \u201cWhat did happen? And where did you go off to just now?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was attacked, and so was Apu\u00e9rto.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttacked?\u201d John echoed sharply. \u201cBy who? I didn\u2019t see anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the guy we\u2019re after attacked Dr. Apu\u00e9rto. One of his friends \u2013 the man who helped solve my neural problem \u2013 attacked me, or rather he triggered the energy sprite I was carrying around to attack me.\u201d\n\nRick pushed back from the table. \u201cEnergy sprite?\u201d\n\nFrank shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s gone now. That\u2019s where I was. Cynthia got rid of it for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Dr. Apu\u00e9rto?\u201d Sala said. \u201cWhat about him? You said he was attacked as well?\u201d\n\nFrank was uncertain how to handle this aspect of the situation. After all, it defied nouny logic, and that undergirded the universe they were supposed to inhabit here. \u201cSomehow, our guy has a way to mess with reality,\u201d he said, watching for reactions. \u201cWhen Dr. Apu\u00e9rto was struggling to recall where his consultant came from, I saw something really strange inside his mind. It was as if someone was trying to swap our witness for one who didn\u2019t know what was going on, like an oblivious dream version of him was about to take over his waking life.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d John said thoughtfully, \u201cwe must be getting very close to whatever this guy is desperate to protect.\u201d\n\nFrank nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what I was thinking, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold on a minute,\u201d Peter said suddenly. \u201cBefore we get into that, there\u2019s still the matter of what happened out in the flyway. You said it was a rescue?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. We don\u2019t know how he does it, but apparently whomever this guy works for, he has a way to cause improbable \u2013 even impossible things to happen. En route to K\u00fcbler-Ross, the MedCenter transport was nearly smashed by an out-of-control cargo unit. Only it was out-of-control directly at them, and their safeties conveniently failed. We forced them to ground, and then took Apu\u00e9rto somewhere safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere,\u201d Sala said, \u201cyou presumably did that probing you wanted to do?\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cAnd once we told him what we knew, that his facility was being used by someone, he couldn\u2019t wait to get back to court and flush him out.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cThat explains his dramatic entrance, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d John said evenly, looking around the table, \u201cthe only way to come out of this mess unscathed is to control the situation. The news people, even the ones I work with, are going to want to play up the emotional triggers, because that\u2019s what gets them attention. They\u2019re used to inflating minor scuffles into weeklong scandals, but this time they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re dealing with. Fortunately, we do, and that\u2019s our advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot exactly,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI may be able to point out the guy behind all this, but I don\u2019t know who he is, or what organization is behind him. Apu\u00e9rto was trying to identify which government agency was involved, and you saw the trouble that caused.\u201d\n\nSala had just opened her mouth to speak, when there was a knock at the door, and a bailiff poked his head in.\n\n\u201cPardon me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut since the witness has recovered from his panic attack, Judge Bennigan would like you all to return to the courtroom.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her we\u2019re not ready,\u201d John said suddenly.\n\nRick held up his hand to stop the bailiff, and looked at John. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nThe bailiff stepped in and shut the door.\n\nJohn thought for a moment. \u201cI told you we had to control the situation. When the GD gave juries the ability to ask questions, it also set things up to discourage them from doing so. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, Rick, but that\u2019s how those of you in the Blue affect most citizen jurors. In any case, we\u2019ve got a nasty situation here, and the only way out of it is to use the rules to our benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Sala said. \u201cThe rules do allow us to decide when we\u2019re ready. The court can wait.\u201d\n\nRick shrugged. \u201cOkay, then they\u2019ll wait.\u201d He nodded to the bailiff.\n\nThe bailiff chuckled as he closed the door. \u201cThis should be interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat minor act of rebellion,\u201d John continued, \u201ctook control of the process away from the judge and both sides\u2019 counsel. Everyone will naturally assume that we have learned something of supreme importance to the case, and that will shift attention from the questions asked by counsel to those asked by us. It\u2019ll also put everyone off their game.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Rick said agreeably. \u201cNow that you\u2019ve turned this case into theatre, what\u2019s the story and the staging?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll handle story,\u201d John said conspiratorially, \u201cyou\u2019ve got more experience with staging.\u201d He paused to glance at the others. \u201cWe know that behind the events posited in this case is a scheme that has some purpose other than simply making money for two corporations. We know that the person behind this didn\u2019t want to be exposed, and was willing to go to extreme lengths to protect that secret. Frank says that he\u2019s in court, and that Apu\u00e9rto now knows who he is as well. Rick?\u201d\n\nThe foreman scratched his head briefly. \u201cIf I were him, I certainly wouldn\u2019t want any spotlight on me. So perhaps we should do what we can to make him nervous. Having us all stare at him would be too obvious, and might disrupt the proceedings, so instead, how about everyone just occasionally glance at him. When we get back inside, Frank, make a note of where he\u2019s sitting. I\u2019ll put it on everyone\u2019s display.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I should warn you all about,\u201d Frank said uncomfortably. \u201cSince the sprite was removed, I might have another attack, and I don\u2019t know how bad it might be.\u201d\n\nRick shrugged. \u201cHey, it\u2019s theatre. We\u2019ll ad lib.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about that bluff?\u201d Peter said. \u201cI mean making everyone think we know something is all well and good, but what if we have to back it up? What happens then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat ought to take care of itself,\u201d John said. \u201cWhen people are nervous, and suggesting that we know something will have that effect, they make mistakes, they give clues to what they don\u2019t want to come out. That\u2019s what we all have to be alert for. So when the case resumes, pay special attention to body language. If someone\u2019s posture or expression looks forced or faked, whatever they\u2019re saying isn\u2019t what they\u2019re thinking. Those are the details that will break this thing open for us.\u201d\n\nSala laughed. \u201cYou have an interesting laboratory technique.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, then,\u201d Rick said, sitting back in his seat, \u201cI guess we\u2019re ready now.\u201d\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll eyes were on the jury from the moment Rick\u2019s powder-blue suit first caught the fluorescing light of the overhead glowtubes. Eight people quietly and purposefully walked to the jury box without returning even one of the curious stares from around the room. They were on a mission, and wanted everyone to know it. None of them sat until all were by their seats, standing straight and still. Then, a moment after the foreman sat down, the others followed suit.\n\nWhile Judge Bennigan reminded the spectators to hold their tongues, Frank scanned their ranks for their adversary and his two confederates. For whatever reason, they were no longer seated together in the middle of the second row of seats. Their ringleader had moved to the first row, directly behind the Respondent\u2019s table, while Carlita Guti\u00e9rez and Allan Wylie now sat in the back row behind the closer Complainant\u2019s table. But what was perhaps more interesting to Frank was that Alex had chosen the farthest seat on the front row, and Mara the closest seat on the rear one. He noted their mark\u2019s position for the others, and sat back to wait for the first witness to be called.\n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\u201d Counsel for the Complainant said, rising from his seat, \u201cI apologize for the confusion caused this morning by permitting Dr. Apu\u00e9rto to continue his testimony so soon after his apparent recovery. Fortunately, he is reported to be in good health.\u201d He walked to the witness box. \u201cWe would now like to continue with the witness that we had originally planned to question this morning, Dr. Meridyth Glacksd\u00f3ttir, Administrator of the Dartmouth MedCenter in Halifax.\u201d\n\nFrank immediately looked at Alex. Dartmouth was where Uru G\u2019danic had been taken after his accident, and where, according to Mara, he\u2019d been killed. If this administrator knew anything about that, or about any other suspicious goings-on, he was determined to find it.\n\nThe door opened, and a bailiff ushered in a woman whose age he couldn\u2019t gauge, and whose face suggested a mix of Icelandic, Black and Native American blood. She paused momentarily as she entered to glance around the room, and then continued to the witness box, where she was sworn in and took her seat.\n\nFrank glanced down at his display, and was relieved to find that she\u2019d agreed to submit to link during her testimony. He was curious, however, about what kind of inner world a person with her background might have.\n\n\u201cThe court,\u201d Counsel began, \u201chas been exploring how staff and management at facilities operated by HealthTech Resources determine what to do when a patient is brought in for evaluation\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile the witness was given the background for the questions to come, Frank closed his eyes and reached towards the witness\u2019 personal space, in preparation for establishing a link. Surprisingly, her energy field neither offered resistance nor deferred to intrusions, as Apu\u00e9rto\u2019s had. Instead, it enfolded his presence, welcoming him as a guest, while at the same time being sure of its own integrity. Frank was intrigued.\n\n\u201c\u2026according to Dr. Migu\u00e9l Apu\u00e9rto, Administrator of the East-Side MedCenter, here in Los Angeles, from an agency of the Global Directorate.\u201d Counsel paused briefly. \u201cFurther, he explained to the court that this same agency supplied guidance in jurisdictional matters, in the form of a consultant. Is this also the case at your facility?\u201d\n\nIn the seconds before Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir spoke, Frank watched a stream of memories slide through her mind. Unlike those he\u2019d shared in the other witnesses, her memories seemed to fade into one another, instead of being represented as discrete bits floating in a field of darkness. This fluidity meant that the inner world she\u2019d developed was significantly different from that of the other witnesses to this case. In fact, it hinted at an inner reality that might transcend the limits of nouny or verby langscapes much as G\u2019danic transcended worldviews.\n\n\u201cYes, it is,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes, just as some of a patient\u2019s symptoms may be more subtle than others, the importance of taking extreme steps to preserve a patient\u2019s life may not be apparent to anyone concerned primarily with their immediate health.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy this,\u201d Counsel said slowly, \u201cdo you mean political considerations?\u201d\n\nWhen she agreed, Frank was treated to a succession of memories, each a mix of sensory recall and the tactile shadow of a subterranean process that she associated with each of the public figures at the center of the memory. Clearly, at least part of her world was quite verby, but it was really more a hybrid.\n\n\u201cThe reason for this,\u201d she said, \u201cwas that the dynamics in which these people are often embedded have far-reaching implications. By preserving their lives in BioStabilization, it became possible to extend the time needed to work out acceptable solutions to the problems caused by their having been injured, and which would be triggered the moment they were to die. That is why the GD\u2019s peacekeeping agency provides a portion of the funding for these facilities.\u201d\n\nAs the thought of the peacekeeping agency flew through the witness\u2019 mind, Frank broke away from her stream of associations, dropped the link, and looked past the Counsel to find their adversary fidgeting uncomfortably. A few seats away, Alex was watching him as well. They had another piece of the puzzle: as Lenny\u2019s conspiracy sheet had suggested, the government was responsible. But they needed more information, and a way to direct the questioning where they wanted it to go, so he pressed the sidebar button to note the comment for later, and closed his eyes again.\n\nEthics had long since ceased to be an issue in this matter, but it still bothered Frank that what he now contemplated doing violated not only his oath to the jury and the Healer\u2019s Oath, but the whole sacred process of legal trials as well. He thought about Peter\u2019s book, and of the changes that had transformed what trials were about and how they worked over the centuries. He wondered what would happen to him if this next act was detected, and of how that would affect Mara and Pegwin. And then he thought about what would happen if he didn\u2019t. After this crisis was over, assuming that he survived it, he was going to have to take a good long look at what he\u2019d done, why, and how he felt about it. Right now, what they needed was a hook, information offered by the witness that they could use later as a means to probe deeper. Just mentioning that such things happened wasn\u2019t enough; they needed an example, because that would permit them to request a counter-example, and thereby get to the heart of this so-called advice.\n\nThis time, when Frank reached out psychically, it wasn\u2019t to link with the witness, but rather to the Counsel standing before her. In one smooth insubstantial motion, he pushed through the man\u2019s energy field, dove into the energy knot of consciousness, and planted a suggestion. Then he retreated. He wasn\u2019t pleased with himself, not one bit. But he knew it had to be done, that it served a greater need for justice, and that, at least, made it sting a bit less.\n\n\u201cOne more question, Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir,\u201d Counsel for the Complainant said, halfway to his seat, and turned back to face her. \u201cIf, as you have said, considering political issues is this important when choosing how to treat a patient, would you please give the court an example, so that we can understand the value of this advice?\u201d\n\nFrank looked at their adversary. He didn\u2019t see much point in monitoring the answer to this question, because it wouldn\u2019t tell them anything anyway. As far as the case was concerned, however, evidence of non-medical personnel, regardless of whether they were from the government or an insurance company, being involved in making medical decisions was enough to prove that the process had been corrupted. That made it suspect, which supported the case against the two corporations. More importantly, it gave the jury an opening, and that made the man even more visibly nervous. And that, in turn, made Alex smile.\n\nAs it turned out, Frank\u2019s suggestion induced Counsel to ask several more questions after that one, but none of them led to what the jury was after. When Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir had satisfied the Counsel\u2019s sudden curiosity, he returned to his table and sat down.\n\nThis time, Rick didn\u2019t even have to say anything. When he raised his finger to interrupt the proceedings, Judge Bennigan dutifully gave him the floor.\n\nInstead of standing immediately, Rick sat for a moment, feigning deep thought and studying witness, counsel and adversary. By this time, the occasional glances of the jurors had started attracting the attention of other members of the crowd, who had begun looking across the room to discern what had so captured the jury\u2019s attention. Their target was now actively avoiding eye contact with them, which forced him into a constrained posture, the strain of which was beginning to show on his face.\n\nWhen Rick finally rose, the spectators quieted. \u201cThank you, Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir,\u201d he began, \u201cfor so carefully explaining to the court how valuable the BioStabilization technology is, both to your patients, and to the world at large.\u201d\n\nFrank had gotten so involved in the theatrics Rick was staging that he\u2019d forgotten to re-establish his link, so he closed his eyes and reached out again. Because the witness\u2019 attention had been directed to global issues, Frank first encountered a stream of memories drawn from news reports she\u2019d seen or read about various high-profile BSW patients.\n\n\u201cWe of the jury, however,\u201d Rick said, reinforcing the idea that they were now acting in concert, \u201care curious about the nature of this advice, as you\u2019ve described it, and your reaction to it. For example, have you or your staff ever acted in opposition to this advice? In other words, have you ever refused to place one of these important people into BioStabilization, even though your government advisor suggested that you do so?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cNo, sir. What would be the point of withholding the best possible care for a patient who had no other options?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, indeed.\u201d Rick glanced down at the other jurors. \u201cBut if you did, what would happen then? Would there be any repercussions?\u201d\n\nFrank wanted to ensure that their witness didn\u2019t suddenly lose her nerve, so he urged her on with a feeling of accomplishment.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d she said, a sudden touch of excitement in her voice.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs before, Angela was keeping an eye on things. This time, however, she was in the courtroom, and doing her best to not be noticed. From her seat near Mara, she could see that her nemesis had raised his right hand slightly. Recalling that he\u2019d held some small device each time he was seen to be translucent in Apu\u00e9rto\u2019s memories, she psychically goosed the woman to his right, forcing a reaction that knocked it from his grip.\n\nStartled and confused, the man bent down to reach for it, but when he saw how far the thing had slid, he sat back and clenched his teeth in frustration.\n\nA few seats to his left, Alex LeBlanc, looking very serious, began drumming his fingers on his thigh.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMomentarily startled by the sound of something metallic skittering across the floor, Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir took a breath and started over. \u201cAs with most agreements, there are obligations and responsibilities placed on each party. Since the BioStabilization equipment is underwritten partially by a grant from the GD, they do reserve the right to request special treatment for certain individuals.\u201d\n\nRick took a breath. \u201cYou\u2019re evading my question. What would happen if you refused this special treatment?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d she said contritely, \u201cwe could very likely have that funding removed, and with it the ability to help many other people with the same technology.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see. Now, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to turn the situation around. Has your GD advisor ever requested that you withhold BioStabilization treatment from someone?\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cAs a matter of fact, that happened just this past week.\u201d\n\nThe image of Uru G\u2019danic\u2019s face floated before Frank as it drifted across her mind. Grabbing the image, Frank dove into the memory that lay behind it.\n\n\u201cWould you please tell the court about that case?\u201d Rick said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want you to violate doctor-patient privacy rules, so you don\u2019t have to reveal the patient\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of our patients, a public figure, was brought in after a construction accident.\u201d A sudden gasp from the back of the room, followed by a wave of whispering, distracted her briefly. \u201cWe used the best of our conventional treatments,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut found that he reacted badly to them. Then, when we changed the regimen, his system had a massive breakdown. It was our opinion that we should over-ride the preferences in his MedNet profile and place him under BioStabilization until we could determine what to do, but we were advised not to, and, in the end, agreed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the patient?\u201d Rick asked. \u201cWhat happened to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe died.\u201d\n\nThis time, the murmur was much louder, and had to be silenced by the judge.\n\nRick thought briefly. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that if it hadn\u2019t been for this advice, your staff would have ignored the man\u2019s MedNet request and placed him under BioStabilization. Is that correct?\u201d\n\nShe hesitated. \u201cTechnically yes, but without that funding, without their advisor, we also wouldn\u2019t have had the equipment, and would therefore not have been able to save his life anyway. If you follow the logic.\u201d\n\nDr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir\u2019s mention of logic released a torrent of related thoughts and memories. Because of the fluid nature of her inner reality, however, it also elicited a stream of incidents that seemed to defy nouny logic. As Frank watched them slither through her mind, it struck him that they were related to the reality shifts that Cynthia had told him about. In each case, the MedCenter Administrator had experienced something that didn\u2019t match what she recalled about some prior incident, an anomaly that most people would have casually written off to a faulty memory. Because her inner world allowed for such things, however, she\u2019d simply learned to live with them.\n\nTaking a closer look at some of these incidents, Frank realized that there was also a pattern to them. They all seemed to relate to patients about whom she had gotten advice from her government consultant. The one he was floating along with at the moment happened in her office, upon reading a report about a new BioStabilization patient, a man involved in some kind of mathematical research. According to the report, the mathematician\u2019s neural attractor patterns showed that there was no reaction to the neurochemical triggers that ought to have kept his amygdala in synch with the rest of his limbic system. Yet, according to all the published research, the subsequent cognitive meltdown that led to his being moved to BSW could never have happened. At least, that was how she remembered the research. But when she requested the paper, it was completely different, and when she contacted the researchers, they confirmed what she\u2019d just read.\n\nFrank searched her memory for what had brought the patient into Dartmouth MedCenter to begin with, and found that it had been a flyway incident. Recalling Apu\u00e9rto\u2019s aborted transfer to K\u00fcbler-Ross Hospice, the sudden sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that hit him at that moment was cut short when he read the patient\u2019s name: Vern Cuoku.\n\nSo Jerry was right. Jen\u2019s cousin had been murdered, and by someone working with the man now sitting a few seats from Alex. But what about Uru G\u2019danic? What did she know about him?\n\n\u201cForgive me for being blunt,\u201d Rick said, a bit taken aback, \u201cbut if you and your staff are willing to ignore the stated preferences in a patient\u2019s MedNet profile, what is the point of having one in the first place?\u201d\n\nWhile Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir recited the corporate litany about the difference between guidance and direction, Frank probed further in her memories. If she knew about G\u2019danic, then he ought to be able to draw it out with the same trick he used in Apu\u00e9rto. But before he\u2019d finished wrapping himself in a reflection of the witness\u2019s sense of self, his concentration was shattered by a searing headache, breaking the link and snapping him back to the more substantial reality of the courtroom.\n\nStruggling to open his migraine-blinded eyes against the glaringly bright light of the heavily diffused glowtubes, and clenching his jaw through short, painful breaths, Frank peered across the courtroom and looked into the self-satisfied face of the man who had caused so much trouble. Whoever he was, and whatever group was behind him, Frank was determined to stop him.\n\n\u201cFrank?\u201d Sala whispered beside him. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\nHe gripped the arms of his chair and shakily pushed himself back in his seat. Clearly, the man had been psychically trained, and not by anyone interested in using the ability for therapeutic purposes. The attack had been focused directly on the point of most psychic leverage, for unless he could drive the distracting pain from his consciousness, he\u2019d be unable to strike back.\n\nA hole suddenly formed in the all-encompassing blast of pain that poked and prodded at his mind. \u2018Hang on, Frank,\u2019 Cynthia\u2019s voice echoed in his head.\n\nAs the area of relief grew wider, he jerked his head to the left to look at Cynthia, who was now sitting quite still, with her eyes closed and look of deep concentration on her face.\n\nWith Cynthia\u2019s protection, Frank quickly regained enough control of his situation to try striking back. But before closing his eyes to focus, he glanced a few seats to Cynthia\u2019s left, and returned Mara\u2019s worried look.\n\n\u201cThank you, Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir,\u201d Rick said.\n\nWhile Frank battled the psychic onslaught and pushed his enforced migraine away, Cynthia continued to provide protection. In a moment, he was again in control, and ready to retaliate.\n\n\u2018Together, now.\u2019 Cynthia\u2019s voice echoed in his mind.\n\nDrawing on all his pent up anger and frustrations, Frank felt for the stream of psi energy pushing at him from across the room, and reached through it to its source. This wouldn\u2019t be any covert link, but the most inexcusable misuse of his training imaginable. Some might be uncomfortable with the thought of having a Healer probe people\u2019s minds, to look into their memories, but that was nothing compared to what a skilled Healer was capable of doing. There had only been a handful of rogue Healers in the history of the profession, and everyone knew there was no humane way to stop them. He only hoped that he wouldn\u2019t be sucked into that deadly behavioral attractor, destroying whatever was left of his integrity in the consuming fire of power.\n\nBlinded to reason, he drove deep into the energy knot of the man\u2019s consciousness, searching for the single most vulnerable aspect of existence, the secret at the core of life itself, our connection to the greater awareness from which we arise, and to which we ultimately return. If the reason for our existence is the universe\u2019s lust for self-knowledge, then this is one lesson it wasn\u2019t going to get. If he could snap that connection, the man would be truly doomed, for his connection to every aspect of reality would be broken, and he\u2019d vanish from\u2014\n\n\u2018Frank, no!\u2019 Cynthia screamed in his mind.\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d A voice echoed in the courtroom.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe sudden exclamation startled everyone but Alex, who had been watching the man intently. He slid his left foot forward, and turned to look across the two people separating him from the person he was now certain had caused Frank to slump in pain a moment before. As the courtroom lurched past murmur and flirted with uproar, some spectators turned to look at the source of the cry, others glanced apprehensively at judge and bailiffs, and a few craned to see the witness, who now wore a very distraught expression. Only Mara was steadfastly watching Frank, and she was halfway out of her seat. A few yards to her left, Cynthia shuddered spasmodically, with eyes closed and fists pressing into her thighs.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen Angela instinctively reached out to stop Frank, she, too pushed past their adversary\u2019s defenses, and then dove into the core of his consciousness. There was no careful way to do it, no crafty subterfuge to conceal her identity, just the horror of a raw psychic intrusion, and the hell with repercussions.\n\nIf she didn\u2019t stop Frank from what he now seemed intent on doing, he would be irretrievably lost to the destructive psychic attractor that lay like a black hole in the bright eye of their profession.\n\nIf he succeeded, he would not only destroy his own life, but cast the work of thousands of Healers over hundreds of years into a pit of distrust from which it might never return. The act was destructive enough by itself; doing it in open court, in full view of dozens of newshounds, however, could easily convince the GD to tear up the agreement at the heart of this case, shut down every single Hospice Center, and prohibit Healers from practicing anywhere.\n\nDesperate to save him from destruction, she wrapped herself around the flaming mass of energy that he was building within the man\u2019s field, and forced him to retreat, to pull the center of his awareness back across the room, where she could use her ability to shield inside-out, preventing him from linking with anyone, at least for now.\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen Alex saw the man jerk again in his seat, he glanced at Frank, who was trembling as well. He rose and dove across the seats. In seconds he had pushed the inert man to the ground, and was beginning to pummel him. People on all sides stood to get out of the way, while both bailiffs rushed over and the judge gaveled for order. Now fully alert, the man struggled to escape. Almost immediately, bailiffs pulled the two apart and held them immobile.\n\nIt took the judge several strikes of her gavel to get enough people\u2019s attention that she could be heard. \u201cTake those two to separate detention rooms. We\u2019ll deal with them later.\u201d\n\nFrank turned to Sala, drew a few short breaths, and whispered, \u201cHe killed my friend, and I just nearly killed him. I need to get out of here.\u201d\n\nShe quickly typed a note for Rick, and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nOnce the bailiffs had removed the two combatants, Judge Bennigan again called for order. \u201cThis case certainly seems to attract its share of trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst Dr. Apu\u00e9rto\u2019s alleged attack by Healer Sanroya, then his flyway incident and miraculous recovery from who knows what, and now this. If this keeps up, I might have to declare this a closed court, just to safeguard the witnesses. Would both counsel please approach the bench.\u201d\n\nWhile the two lawyers were getting up, Rick raised a hand to interrupt. \u201cYour honor,\u201d he said, \u201cunder the circumstances, I suggest that we take a short recess, and give everyone a chance to calm down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take a 10 minute recess.\u201d Then, looking at the two lawyers, she added, \u201cWould you two please join me in my office?\u201d\n\n---\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs soon as the jury room door was closed, they dropped the veneer of formality and drew close to Frank.\n\n\u201cWhat happened out there?\u201d Sala asked.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter agreed.\n\nFrank held his hands up for some space, and collapsed into a nearby chair. \u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d he said weakly.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Rick said, taking a seat, and motioning the others to follow suit.\n\nFrank looked over at Peter. \u201cWhen I was examining her memories, I discovered that Dr. Glacksd\u00f3ttir had noticed a reality shift. Whoever these people are, they killed the patient my friend Jerry was investigating \u2013 the one he\u2019d asked you to get some information about \u2013 but there\u2019s no way to prove it. None.\u201d\n\nSala sat as well. \u201cWhat happened to you, though? It seemed like you suddenly took ill out there.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her and shook his head. \u201cI was pushed actually. Our guy attacked me psychically. Fortunately, Cynthia was there to help.\u201d He glanced at several confused faces. \u201cFrom across the room. You know.\u201d\n\nThe others took seats, and leaned towards him.\n\n\u201cAnd that skirmish?\u201d John asked, ever alert for a news angle. \u201cWhat was that about? And who was that other guy? He looks familiar.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlex LeBlanc,\u201d Frank said. \u201cMy brother-in-law. I\u2019d told him that our mark was in the room, and he must have figured out who it was on his own.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou told me that you nearly killed him?\u201d Sala said quietly.\n\nHe nodded. \u201cI was so enraged, I just lost it.\u201d He stared at the table. \u201cI\u2019d intentionally blown into his mind, and was about to snuff him out, when Cynthia stopped me, pushed me back. I suppose the guy would have done the same to me, or worse, if Alex hadn\u2019t flattened him just then.\u201d\n\nThey were quiet for a few moments. Then Rick took a deep breath. \u201cWhat do you want to do? We can excuse you, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. \u201cThat might be for the best. I\u2019ve got my family to consider, and the way things are headed, my daughter could end up with a dead father. But I still want to get in to see him, to find out what all this is really about. Is there any way to do that?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re excused,\u201d Sala said, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason they\u2019d keep you out. After all, you might want to apologize for what your brother-in-law did. They ought to believe that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Frank said, \u201cbut what about the case? Won\u2019t you need me to\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Rick said. \u201cYou\u2019ve given us plenty to go on already.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n([TOC](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gznork26/comments/1c4ue2f/deadly_attractor_table_of_contents/))", "comment_created_utc": 1714388430.0, "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

Your scratchy black suit rubs against two arms wrapped in finer material. You shift in your seat, moving uncomfortably in the plush chair beneath you. Your leg is shaking; you are anxious for the show to begin. The massive room rumbles with murmurs of conversation\u2014inquisitions about how the show will be, complaints of hunger, protests of too-tight clothing, and ties choking necks. You are silent. \n\t\n\nSeptember 6, 1981\n\nLouise trudged up the dusty gravel path towards her home, a rotted trailer perched atop a steep hill. The bus driver never ventured up the path, leaving Louise to trek the quarter mile herself. She stopped momentarily and watched as the yellow bus sped away; the shadow of a lone hand waved her goodbye. She waved back, too late for anyone to see it, \u201cBye, Miles.\u201d\n\nHer house stank of cigarette smoke. The soft shag carpet collected to odor, spitting it out with every step. The windows and walls were yellowed with nicotine. The trailer was quiet; the constant droning of the radiator was the only thing to be heard. Louise set her backpack down and walked into the kitchen to make herself dinner. Her mother wouldn\u2019t be home for several hours, and school lunch was never enough. \n\nAfter Louise ate a measly bowl of microwaved leftover Kraft, she sat down to do her homework. She pulled out the math sheet they had gotten that day. Numbers shifted and combined; they peeled off the page and swam around her. Louise needed help. She dialed a number she knew by heart. The line rang.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d a woman\u2019s voice answered, her voice slightly distorted through the phone.\n\n\u201cHi, Mrs. Wilson,\u201d Louise said in a timid voice.\n\n\u201cHi, Louise,\u201d Mrs. Wilson\u2019s voice softened, \u201cI\u2019ll get him for you.\u201d\n\nLouise heard her muffled yell, \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey Louise! What\u2019s up?\u201d a boy's voice asked.\n\n\u201cHi, Miles. Have you done your math homework?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it right now.\u201d\n\nLouise stretched the cord to where she sat at the table, \u201cGreat.\u201d\n\n\nThe lights dim, and silence washes over the crowd. The curtains part. Fifty people in tuxedos sit on stage, various instruments in hand. The conductor stands tall. He introduces the orchestra, lifts his gloved hands, and the music begins. \n\n\nMarch 9, 1983\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still coming, right?\u201d Miles questioned nervously.\n\n\u201cYes, Miles, I\u2019m still coming,\u201d Louise rolled her eyes before smiling at him.\n\nMiles relaxed a little bit, \u201cOkay, good.\u201d\n\nMiles had mousy brown hair that was cut short. His dad had served in the military, so he thought this boy should have a \u2018man\u2019s haircut.\u2019 He was tan even in the wintertime. He had bright hazel eyes that glowed electric green in the sunlight. Louise was about an inch taller than Miles, a fact she was immensely proud of. \n\nThe pair walked down the school hallway. It was Friday. Wonderful, glorious Friday. Louise rejoiced in the days that she didn\u2019t have to come into school and pretend she liked people\u2014 pretend she liked anything, really. She hated the teachers, her peers, the hospital grey of the walls. She liked Miles. He ignored the cigarette stink of her clothes and the rudeness of her tone. \n\nToday was Miles\u2019 birthday. He\u2019ll be ten. Miles had invited everyone to the party; there would be a bounce house. He\u2019s \u2018going all out for the big one o\u2019 as he kept telling Louise. She was nervous about the party; her gift was okay at best, and she dreaded the disappointed but polite smile she knew Miles would pull. \n\n\u201cMy mom will be here right after school to pick us up. You know what my mom\u2019s car looks like, right?\u201d Miles asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, I remember.\u201d \n\nLousie walked out to Mrs. Wilson\u2019s car, a sleek, silver Porsche; Louise felt like a celebrity when she rode in it\u2014rich and important. \n\n\u201cHi, Louise,\u201d Mrs. Wilson smiled, \u201cHow was school?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Mrs. Wilson. It was good.\u201d\n\nLouise settled into the plush leather seats and set her backpack in front of her. They sat in silence for a moment, the soft drum of the radio filling the air. Miles ripped open the door, excitement lighting up his face. He sat down, his position mirroring Louise\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHey, buddy. How was your day?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked.\n\n\u201cIt was great, Mom,\u201d he smiled.\n\nShe smiled back warmly, \u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nMrs. Wilson pulled out of the parking lot, Louise and Miles chatted idly about school and the party. After a short while, they pulled up to Miles\u2019 house\u2014a two-story white house with columns in front. Louise loved it. Sometimes, during sleepovers, late at night, she pretended it was hers. She quietly walked down hallways, running her fingertips across the smooth wallpaper. She felt the soft carpet on her bare toes and imagined it knew the shape and weight of her foot. She opened the fridge and pretended not to be surprised at the selection of food that awaited her. Then, she would return to Miles\u2019 room and lie down next to him in the sleeping bag he lent her, stare up at the tiny glowing stars stuck on his ceiling, and pretend it was her and her mom that put them up\u2014 that it was her mom that held the step stool for her so she wouldn't fall. \n\nLouise and Miles hopped out of the car, ran up to his room, and plopped their bags down. They still had a few hours before their other classmates would arrive. They sat on the ground and leaned against the bed. Louise pulled out Miles\u2019 gift from her bag and handed the small gift bag to him, \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not time for the party,\u201d Miles said, confusion evident in his voice. \n\nLouise shrugged, \u201cI wanted to give it to you now.\u201d\n\nMiles smiled at her before gently taking the tissue paper out of the bag and reaching in. He pulled out a light blue paper swan. Lousie had spent hours getting the folds just right so the paper was sharp instead of rumpled. It was beautiful. \n\n\u201cLouise,\u201d Miles started, his face curved into a slight frown, like he was about to cry, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you really like it?\u201d Louise asked nervously; she fidgeted with her fingernails. \n\nMiles set the swan down gently and dove towards her, wrapping her in a hug, \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\nThe party was a hit. Louise nearly made herself sick from the combination of an ungodly amount of candy and jumping in the bounce house. Almost everyone from their class was there, shoving presents in Miles\u2019 hands before running to the snacks and entertainment. Night fell, and Louise climbed in the Porsche again, though it was just her and Mrs. Wilson this time. \n\n\u201cDid you have a good time, Louise?\u201d she asked, making eye contact through the rearview mirror.\n \n\u201cYeah, it was awesome. Thank you for having me,\u201d Louise responded, polite as ever. \n\n\u201cOh, you are always welcome, sweetie,\u201d Mrs. Wilson smiled. \n\nLouise looked out the window for the rest of the drive, the stars blurring against the black night sky. They pulled up to Louise\u2019s house; her driveway was empty.\n\n\u201cAre you sure you are okay until your mom gets here?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked. \n\nLouise smiled fakely, \u201cYeah I\u2019ll be alright. She should be home soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, sweetheart.\u201d\n\nLouise climbed out of the car and walked to her door. She looked back before stepping inside\u2014Mrs. Wilson\u2019s face was a mirage of pity and sympathy. Louise waved and stepped inside, choking down guilt as she did. \n\n\nThe sweet sound of a violin fills your ears\u2014a lone instrument bellowing a quiet tune. It starts slow\u2014soft, like a warm hand caressing your face, a mother wiping away your tears. \n\nYou forget yourself for a moment; you are back in your childhood home, where your bed is indented with your shape. You smell your favorite meal being cooked downstairs. You hear your mother humming her favorite song from the kitchen. Your father isn\u2019t home yet. You are excited to see him. \n\nYou wish it were real. \n\nIt is not. \n\n\nJune 11, 1984\n\nLouise was having a terrible day. Her mother was off work and slumming around the house\u2014 she was like a ghost in her own home, and she had nothing to do. They didn\u2019t have cable this month, so Louise\u2019s options were to sit in her bed and do nothing or visit Miles. She chose the latter. Louise bid her mom a short goodbye, telling her where she was going and not much else, and peddled off on her bike. She was drenched by the time she arrived at Miles\u2019 house. So she ditched her bike in the grass and ran to ring the doorbell. Mrs. Wilson answered.\n\n\u201cOh. Hello, Louise,\u201d she smiled.\n\nMrs. Wilson was a nice woman, and Louise absolutely loved her. She was as thin as a twig but had a motherly warmth about her that Louise itched for. Miles was the spitting image of her, matching her tanned skin and bright eyes. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Miles isn\u2019t here,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Louise said, disappointment swirling around her tongue. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hun,\u201d Mrs. Wilson gave her a sympathetic look, \u201cHe\u2019s out with his dad fishing for the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Louise lied and started to walk back to where she abandoned her bike. \n\n\u201cWait a second, sweetheart,\u201d she called, \u201cDo you want some lemonade? I\u2019d hate to just send you home after you rode all this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, Mrs. Wilson. Thank you.\u201d\n\nLouise followed her into the kitchen and sat down at one of the barstools to wait. It wasn\u2019t long before she had a nice tall glass of lemonade in front of her and a bag of chips in her hand. \n\n\u201cYou can go watch TV if you want,\u201d Mrs. Wilson smiled at her, \u201cI\u2019ll be out in the garden if you ever need anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, thank you,\u201d Louise said. \n\nShe wandered into the living room, and the plush carpet under her feet felt amazing. She flicked on the television and turned it to her favorite cartoon station. She did feel strange behaving like she lived there, especially when the house was empty, but her desire to relax in the air conditioning trumped the feeling. She mindlessly watched Jerry outsmart Tom in the comfort of a home that wasn\u2019t her\u2019s. \n\nLouise finished her snack but didn\u2019t feel like returning home; she knew her mother would be there, heating the house with cigarettes and sex. Mary had moved on from Steve quickly. \nSo, she laid down and continued watching television. At some point, she fell asleep. Louise woke up to the soft voices of Miles\u2019 parents talking in the kitchen. Someone had turned the TV off and taken her dishes. She could hear the shower running upstairs. Louise had no idea what time it was; the sun was now visible in the living room windows, the sky was orange. She was about to get up and ask Mrs. Wilson when she heard her name. Miles\u2019 parents were talking about her. She got up as quietly as she could and snuck closer to the swinging kitchen door.  \n\n\u201cIs there something we can do?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked her husband in a concerned tone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Jenny,\u201d Mr. Wilson responded, \u201cShe just has a hard life, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like we should do more for her.\u201d\n\nMr. Wilson sighed, \u201cWe can only help her when she\u2019s here. You know what Mary thinks about handouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, poor Mary,\u201d Mrs. Wilson said, her tone sympathetic, \u201cI should call her and tell her Louise is gonna stay the night.\u201d\n\nLouise heard footsteps sound in her direction. She ran as softly as she could back to her position on the couch, feigning sleep. Mrs. Wilson swung open the door and picked up the phone that hung on the wall next to it. Louise heard the click-clack of buttons being pressed, the muffled ringing, and then her mother\u2019s voice on the other line. \n\n\u201cHey, Mary,\u201d Mrs. Wilson said, \u201cIs it alright if Louise stays here tonight? She passed out on the couch and I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be smart to have her ride home now.\u201d\n\nLousie couldn\u2019t hear her mother's exact words, but she must have said it was fine because the next thing Louise knew, she was being picked up and carried up the stairs. Mrs. Wilson set her down in a room she was unfamiliar with. She figured it was the guest room. Mrs. Wilson kissed Louise gently on her forehead and told her goodnight in a whispered tone. Louise missed her mother. \n\nThe room was bird-themed. The walls were painted a dark navy, and a thin metal peacock stared at her from where it hung. A copy of the NATO phonetic alphabet was hanging, too. It must have been Miles\u2019 old room. Louise remembered when he came to school in second grade and told her he was moving into the attic. There was an opening to the roof up there, and Miles was in love with the idea of sitting up there and watching the sun set and rise. \n\nMiles was in love with a lot when he was little\u2014 the sun and sky, the warmth of his mother\u2019s hugs, iced tea on a hot day. Louise didn\u2019t think she was in love with anything. She didn\u2019t think she ever would be. Louise was almost asleep, the plush, silky sheets lulling her into another bout of slumber. Her door squeaked open. Miles\u2019 small frame was a shadow in the doorway. He looked so small. He didn\u2019t walk into the room, choosing to loom in the entrance. \n\n\u201cGoodnight, Louise,\u201d he said in a small voice. \n\n\u201cGoodnight, Miles.\u201d\n\n\nWhen you were little, you thought everything was perfect. The world was alive with hope and magic. Everyone got along, and there was nothing wrong. \n\nOf course, now you know that is not true. But a part of you, a little tiny part, wants to go back to when you didn\u2019t know. When life was good, and you didn\u2019t know better. \n\nThat\u2019s how the music sounds. Like you are an innocent kid sitting on the front porch eating a red cherry popsicle. The juice runs down your face. It looks like blood. \n\n\nJuly 15, 1984\n\nLouise was once again sitting in the back seat of the Wilsons\u2019 Porsche, but this time, she was without a backpack-- sans her school clothes. She wore the itchy Easter dress her grandmother had gotten her two years prior. Louise wore it to her funeral. She stuck out like a sore thumb, a pastel beacon amongst the waves of black. \nIt was Sunday\u2014the Lord\u2019s Day, as Mrs. Wilson had told her. Louise hadn\u2019t been inside a church for a good reason\u2014she\u2019d never been to a regular Sunday mass. But last night, she had stayed the night at Miles\u2019, so she was on her way to church. There were no ifs, ands, or buts about it. \n\nThey pulled into the parking lot, the ancient steeple looming over the car. Louise could recognize that it was a beautiful church, but the body of Christ hanging in the stained glass window did nothing to settle her nervous stomach. The pop of car doors sounded; there was no going back. \n\nThe wooden pew was uncomfortable, the kneelers even more so. She listened to Miles\u2019 soft whispers of direction and did as he said. She fell and rose when she should; she crossed her arms instead of taking communion, she shook hands with strangers, and mumbled, \u2018Peace be with you.\u2019 \nAnd then it was over, and Louise was waking back to the car, her white flats cutting into her feet. \n\n\u201cWhat did you think, Louise?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked in a kind voice. \n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, \u201cIt was okay. I didn\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll learn,\u201d Mrs. Wilson responded, a promise on the tip of her tongue. \n\nLouise was silent on the ride back; she leaned against the window and watched as trees blurred together in a mirage of green. Louise didn\u2019t know what it was like to believe in God. She thought she felt it there for a moment-- a quiet tingling in the back of her mind. But then she remembered that she wasn\u2019t with her family; the Wilsons were not her parents. She remembered her mom was working a double today so they could have electricity. And what God would think that was fair? Not one Louise wanted to believe in. \n\n\nThe music sounds like the church hymns your mother made you sing. She meant well; she thought she was giving you the gift of her religion. You couldn\u2019t tell her you didn\u2019t want it. It was all she had ever known. \n\nWhat child betrays their mother?\n\n\nMay 21, 1985 \n\nIt was the summer after sixth grade. Lousie and Miles had biked to the pool in town, a desperate attempt to escape the heat. The air was thick and humid, and sweat sprouted from Louise's skin, dampening her shirt and shorts. The sun beamed down on her back; there wasn\u2019t a cloud in sight. The pair parked their bikes out front and ran into the small building. A bored-looking teenager accepted their fifty cents each and let them in. \nThe air reeked of chlorine, and the painted concrete was slick with warm water. Miles and Louise threw their towels down and began to shed their swimsuits. Louise\u2019s hands were shaking with anticipation; she hadn't been to the pool in so long. \n\n\u201cRace you,\u201d Miles said, darting towards the water's edge. \n\n\u201cNo fair,\u201d Louise groaned as she kicked off her flip-flops and ran after him. \n\nLouise heard a distant whistle ringing and a call that running wasn\u2019t allowed before she splashed into the blue depths. The cool water encapsulated her, and goosebumps formed on her skin. She bobbed to the surface and saw Miles climbing out and heading towards the diving board. \n\nThey stayed until the sun was beginning to set; Miles\u2019 mom didn\u2019t like him being out that late on his own yet, so they peddled back home soggy clothes and pruny skin. \n\nWhen Louise returned to her house, it was dark. She could see the kitchen light shining out onto the brown lawn. Steve was home. Louise\u2019s mom, Mary, had picked him up a few months back. He was a short, fat man. His breath always smelled like beer, yeasty and vile. He had dark hair and a beard to match. Her mother claimed she really liked him, but Louise knew she just needed someone to help pay the bills. \n\nOne of the few good things about having kids as young as Louise\u2019s mom had her is that she never had a hard time finding a sleazy older guy to keep around. Being pretty also helped, and Mary sure was pretty. Mary was tall and slender, with long, curly auburn hair. She was covered in freckles and had eyes that glowed emerald green. When Louise was young, Mary would smile often, but as her eyebags grew, her smile faded. She could fake it when needed, but it was never like Louise remembered. \n\nMary and Louise could have been twins\u2014 minus the smile lines she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever have the chance to earn. Maybe that was why, when Louise walked into her kitchen in nothing more than a bathing suit, Steve forced himself on her. \n\nYou clutch the armrest on your chair, digging your nails into the fabric. The music is screeching, a distorted version of what it once was. You want to cry. You think your ears are bleeding. You bite the inside of your cheek, hoping to distract yourself from the perverted disgust mess of noise assaulting you. Your mouth tastes like metal. The urge to stand and walk, no, run, out of the theater is so strong you can hardly bear it.\n \nYou do not get up. \n\n\nMay 22, 1985\n\nMiles called and asked if she wanted to go swimming again. Louise didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him she never wanted to go swimming again, so she lied and said she was sick. Miles was at her door an hour later with a container of homemade cookies and Guess Who. \n\nThe two sit on the floor of Louise\u2019s bedroom, the soft blanket she put down covering the scratchy carpet. Louise\u2019s room was small and dingy. The walls were cracked and stained; she lived out of one small bureau that had been unceremoniously shoved into a corner of the room. Last Christmas, she begged her mother to help her hang lights on the ceiling. They were still up, casting a rainbow glow over the room. It was the only source of light she used. She had a small nightstand piled with pencils and markers; she had long since stained her light pink sheets while drawing. \nCookie crumbles littered the floor. Louise was losing the game; most of her people were still up, while Miles only had about five people left to choose from. He chewed his lip in concentration. Louise usually laughed at him for it; he always seemed to take the board games they played too seriously. This time, she didn\u2019t notice he was doing it. \n\n\u201cDoes your person have brown hair?\u201d Miles questioned.\n\nLouise didn\u2019t respond.\n\u201cLouise? Are you alrigh\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo your parents ever touch you?\u201d Louise said, eyes trained on the floor.\n\nMiles\u2019 face scrunched up in confusion, \u201cYou mean like hugs?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean then?\u201d Miles questioned. \n\nLouise\u2019s eyes fogged up with tears, \u201cNever mind. Let\u2019s just play the game.\u201d\n\nMiles eyed her with sympathetic confusion before realizing what she meant, \u201cLouise\u2026\u201d\n\nHe moved to hug her, but she flinched away from him. Miles sat back; he wasn\u2019t touching her but was close enough for her to feel the heat radiating off of him. Louise sniffled, trying desperately to contain her emotion. \n\n\u201cDo you want me to leave you alone?\u201d Miles whispered.\n\nLouise turned to look at him, her face pale and puffy, \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLouise and Miles sat like that for a long time. When the sun set, he got up and called his mom, begging her to let him stay the night. Louise didn\u2019t hear the conversation, but Mrs. Wilson must have agreed because the next thing she knew, she was being guided to bed, and Miles was settled on the floor next to her, leaning against the bed and holding her hand. \n\n\nThe music turned sweet. It drifted through your ears pleasantly, passing over the cracked, dry blood. A chorus of flutes is playing, light and soft. \n\nIt feels like the pillow in your dorm room, childhood mixed with freedom. \n\nYou know this feeling won\u2019t last. But right now, in this moment, you lay your head down and pretend the world is new. \n\n\nMay 17, 1986\n\nMiles and Louise had biked miles to the movie theater. Miles had begged Louise to see the new movie coming out, one that Louise was less than excited about. He had been to the movies some months before with his mom and had seen the trailer. The next day, he begged her to see it with him when it came out, and she agreed, not knowing anything about it. \n\nMiles was practically giddy with excitement. His eyes glowed with it. The theater was packed; they stood in the line shoulder to shoulder with what must have been every other kid in town. Louise clung to the red crushed velvet rope that segmented the line for dear life. The feeling of so many people pressed up against her was nauseating. She screwed her eyes shut, pushing down a wave of oncoming dizziness. Before she knew it she was being pulled along to the ticket stand. Miles produced them with a broad smile on his face, \u201cTwo for Top Gun.\u201d\n\nHe then bought a giant thing of buttery popcorn and two glass Cokes. They made their way to their seats and waited for the movie to begin. Miles shoved popcorn in his mouth, salty yellow kernels going everywhere. Trailers for various movies played on the big screen\u2014 Miles leaned over nearly every time and asked Louise if she would go with him. She said yes every time. \n\nThe movie was beautiful. It was nothing like Louise had ever seen before; it made her yearn for the sky, the feeling of freedom unlike anything she would ever know. And then it was tragic, and she was crying in her seat, wailing over someone she didn\u2019t know. Begging him to wake up. \n\nThey left in silence, walking to the bike rack to a chorus of shoes against pavement. They stalled for a moment before getting onto their bikes and parting their ways.\n\n\u201cWhat would you do if I died?\u201d Miles said, his eyes trained on Louise\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d her eyes were red and puffy, \u201cI don\u2019t think I could go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d Miles agreed.\n\nMiles stared at her for a beat before getting on his bike and peddling home. Louise imagined her life without Miles on the way home. Sharp metal against skin, blood seeping into water. She didn\u2019t think it would be much of a life. \n\n\nWhen you were in 6th grade, you played the clarinet. You always had a fondness for them.\n\nThey were the only ones playing, the dulcet tones of a wooden reed against black plastic. The song was picking up pace, like a heartbeat. \n\nIn 6th grade band, you sat next to a girl you liked. She was better at the instrument than you. You didn\u2019t care. You remember taking her to the winter formal and carrying her shoes when her feet got sore. You remember your dad giving you the talk before you went. \n\nYou haven\u2019t seen her in years. You wonder how she\u2019s doing. \n\nThe clarinets are done with their solo. You forget about her again. \n\n\nAugust 21, 1987\n\nThis year, Louise\u2019s birthday fell on the first day of school. She dressed nicer than usual, an attempt at vanity that made her hate herself. Miles had given her a music box that played You Are My Sunshine. Louise had told him that she missed it when her mom sang it to her before bed. She cried in the bathroom. \n\nAt lunch, she stood in line with a group of girls in her PE class. Miles was a few feet ahead of her, and the kids in her school took cutting in line more seriously than she thought was necessary, so she stayed put. She stood silently while the girls talked about a teacher they didn\u2019t like, choosing instead to eavesdrop on the conversations around her rather than contribute to the one she was in. \n\nBrian Miller\u2019s voice sounded broken and raspy, like a kid with money for cigarettes and not much else. He was a stereotypical bully, big and tall, with an ugly look plastered everywhere he went. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of someone not being in pain. He was talking to Miles, his voice loud enough for Louise to hear from where she was: \u201cWhy do you hang out with that poor girl all the time? Does she give it up easily?\u201d\n\nHis lips were curled in a cruel sneer, showing off his yellow teeth. Miles looked at him, barely visible to Louise over the people between them. Then, suddenly, he wound up and punched Brian square in the face. Louise heard the crunch of his nose being broken\u2014 blood spurted on the floor and onto the onlooking students. Brian grunted in pain, bringing his hand to touch his bloodied face slowly before launching into a vicious returning attack. He only got a few punches on Miles before the nearest teacher pulled him away. \nLouise pushed through the crowd that had formed, leaning down at Miles\u2019 side. His face was nearly unrecognizable; bruises were starting to form already.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do that? Oh my god, Miles, why did you do that?\u201d Louise choked out, tears fogging her vision. \n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Miles tried to smile, blood staining his teeth. \n\nA teacher pushed Louise out of the way, assessing the damage. What felt like seconds later, an ambulance appeared, along with Mrs. Wilson. She was frantic; her hands were shaking with fear. Everything was silent. At some point, everyone had cleared out except Louise. She was standing here like an idiot, staring at Miles\u2019 bloodied face. \n\nLouise felt a strong hand grab her arm, a mother\u2019s hand, \u201cCome on, Louise. You can ride along.\u201d\nMrs. Wilson stood in front of Louise. Her eyes were red, but she had composed herself. Louise\u2019s voice came out as nothing more than a whisper: \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nShe let herself be pulled into the ambulance; the siren was the only thing she could hear. She watched as the EMTs worked, their skilled, gloved hands dancing over his body. \n\n\u201cLouise, he\u2019s gonna be okay,\u201d Mrs. Wilson whispered in her ear, \u201cCome here.\u201d\n\nShe pulled Louise into a hug, hiding her view of Miles. Louise closed her eyes against Mrs. Wilson, willing her breath to slow. They stopped abruptly at the hospital. Louise and Mrs. Wilson climbed out and watched as nurses and interns swarmed Miles\u2019 gurney. They were ushered to the waiting room and sat down on hard, terribly patterned chairs. At some point, Mrs. Wilson called Louise\u2019s mother to tell her where she was. \nA doctor brought them to Miles\u2019 room after over an hour. His face had been cleaned and bandaged, and his nose was clearly broken.\n \n\u201cLouise,\u201d Miles said, his eyes lighting up. \n\n\u201cMiles,\u201d Louise responded, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m right as rain,\u201d he tried to smile but winced.\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Miles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he reassured her, reaching up to squeeze her hand.\n\nThey stood like that until Louise\u2019s mom came to get her. Louise crawled into Mary\u2019s beat-up Sedan and slumped in the seat. \n\n\u201cAre you okay, baby?\u201d Mary asked her.\n\n\u201cMom, what if he died?\u201d Louise ignored the question. \n\nMary sighed, \u201cSweetheart he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s just got a concussion and a broken nose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Louise said, \u201cI know he\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nThe bags under Mary\u2019s eyes seemed heavier today, and her face seemed more wrinkled. Louise looked more like her every day. \n\n\nThe music takes on a somber tone. Long, drawn-out notes fill the air. You think of your mother again, the way she looked sunken in her hospital bed\u2014 decaying before your eyes. You remember the feel of her bony, pale hands wiping away your tears in her final moments. \n\nIt was the first time you saw your dad cry.\n\nThe wail of violin chokes you. \n\n\nDecember 17, 1988\n\nLouise was lying on her back in Miles\u2019 bed. He\u2019s had the same one since they were kids; the box springs creak under their weight. Miles was above her, his eyes boring holes in hers. His parents were not home, the house was eerily quiet\u2014 the ambient creaking distracting Louise. \nHis record player sang sweet music from his desk. His room was cluttered with dirty clothes and various knick-knacks. A blue paper swan sat on his bookshelf next to his worn copy of The Hobbit. His closet was open, casting weird shadows along the walls. The lights were off.\n \nThe soft touch of Miles\u2019 lips trailed down her chest to her stomach. She tried to push down the nausea\u2014 make her body stop squirming. Her hand clutched his shoulder tightly. He had asked if this was okay. She had said yes. \n\nLouise felt another article of clothing being slid off her body. She was cold. Her eyes shot to the ceiling. One glowing star was still stuck on the popcorn texture. Miles had taken them off the year before. He had missed one. Louise felt the heat of salty water run down her face into the soft pillow. She hated herself. \n\n\u2018Dear God,\u2019 she thought, \u2018if you can hear me please, please just let me be okay. Let me want this.\u2019\n\nShe didn\u2019t receive a response. God wasn\u2019t listening. It was just her and Miles in a house too big, in a world too small. \n\n\u201cLouise?\u201d Miles said, his voice laced with concern, \u201cHey. Are you okay?\u201d\n\nAll she could muster was an \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 before getting up, running into the bathroom, and emptying her stomach into the toilet. \n\nThe air stunk of sour yeast.\n\t\n\nThe music bounced up and down, building up to its crescendo. Excitement filled your chest, the entire orchestra almost all playing now. \n\nA chorus of brass filled the air\u2014French horns and trumpets battle for dominance on stage. Your eyes are wide in anticipation; you have waited the entire night for this. \n\nYou are sixteen, and you and your friends sit around a fire, passing a bottle of Jack around. It is the Friday before school starts. You wanted one last night of summer fun before your life filled with books and assignments. \n\nThe whiskey burns a path down your throat. It makes you nauseous. You get so drunk you can\u2019t stand up. Your vision blurs as you stumble into the surrounding woods. You are alone. You vomit more than you thought was possible. You think you are going to die. You miss your mom.\n\nYou haven't drank since. \n\nYou don\u2019t think you ever will. \n\n\nAugust 4, 1989\n\nThe granite bar was cool under Louise\u2019s fingertips. She sat in Miles\u2019 kitchen, spinning nervously on the metal bar stool. She was chewing her lip; her mouth tasted like blood. Miles sat next to her, his demeanor the exact opposite of Louise\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI mean, come on, Louise. What are you gonna do with your life?\u201d Mrs. Wilson lectured her. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Louise mumbled. \n\nMrs. Wilson sighed, \u201cMiles has wanted to be a pilot since he was eight. What do you want?\u201d\n\nLouise took a deep breath, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be like Miles. But I\u2019m not your fucking kid so leave me alone.\u201d\n\nLouise stood up and stomped up the stairs. She heard Mrs. Wilson yelling her name, but she didn\u2019t turn around. She buried herself in Miles\u2019 bed, wrapping herself in his soft comforter. Louis heard the stairs creak with weight and then a knock on the door. \n\n\u201cLouise, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Miles said, walking into the room.\n\nLouise sat up, her face dry, \u201cWhy are you sorry? You didn\u2019t yell at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still feel sorry,\u201d he said as he sat down next to her.\n\nLouise took a deep breath and leaned on his shoulder. Miles rested his head against hers, \u201cShe loves you, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe just wants you to do well,\u201d Miles said. \n\n\u201cShe wants me to be better than my mother,\u201d Louise corrected.\n\n\u201cIs that so bad?\u201d\n\n\nThe music doesn\u2019t matter right now. You are fifteen, and your father is yelling at you about your future. You don\u2019t know what you want to do. You want to be better than him. \n\nHe backhands you.\n\nThe arm of the person next to you brushes against yours. You jump. The conductor's hands are blurry with movement. The theater is alive with sound. \n\nYou miss your dad. \n\n\nFebruary 14, 1990\n\nLouise and Miles sat across from each other in a restaurant that was too nice for the amount of money they brought. Louise ran her fingers across the laminated menu, fidgeting nervously with the edge of the paper. The restaurant was packed, Miles had made the reservations months in advance.\n\n\u201cDo you know what you want?\u201d Miles asked.\n\nLouise pursed her lips, \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get the chicken piccata.\u201d\n\nMiles eyed the menu, \u201cThat looks good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you gonna get?\u201d she returned the question.\n\nMiles smiled, almost boyishly, \u201cThe steak.\u201d\n\nLouise hummed in response.  She set her menu down and reached for her water glass, running her finger across the rim. Condensation dripped down outside the glass, her fingerprints marking the surface. \n\n\u201cAre you excited about prom?\u201d Miles asked.\n\nLouise laughed a little, \u201cDo we really have nothing else to talk about other than a dance in two months?\u201d\n\nMiles rolled his eyes playfully, \u201cI guess not. What did we talk about when we were kids?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have honestly no idea,\u201d Louise smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t think we talked a lot. We mostly played.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did play an ungodly amount of Donkey Kong.\u201d\n\nLouise chuckled, \u201cGod, was that game even good? Or were we just kids?\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly have no idea,\u201d Miles smiled. \n\nThe waiter came by and took their order, collecting their menus and refreshing their drinks. It wasn\u2019t long before their food arrived; the plates were decedent and beautiful. They left the restaurant with doggy bags in hand and significantly poorer than when they walked in. Louise clambered into Miles\u2019 truck and waited for Miles to start it. But he didn\u2019t. He was staring at her instead. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked incredulously. \n\nHe smiled at her, \u201cI have something for you.\u201d\n\nHer face fell in surprise, \u201cMiles, you told me the dinner was a gift.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Miles shrugged.\nHe reached into his pocket and produced a small velvet box. She took it gingerly into her hands, excitement boiling in her chest. She opened the box softly and found two silver rings. One was engraved with \u2018Miles,\u2019 and the other said \u2018Louise.\u2019 Miles picked up the one that said his name and handed it to her. \n\n\u201cThis one is for you,\u201d he looked at her with huge puppy-dog eyes, \u201cAnd the other one is for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiles\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked nervously.\n\nShe melted, \u201cI love it. I love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he said, leaning in and kissing her sweetly. \n\n\u201cAre your parents home?\u201d she asked against his lips.\n\n\u201cNo, they won\u2019t be home in hours.\u201d\n\nThis time was different than the first. No bile rose up into Louise\u2019s throat; she didn\u2019t have to repress her squirming body. The air smelled like clean linen\u2014 fresh and new. \n\n\nYou are crying, and you don\u2019t know why. The music sounds more like singing now, wrapping you in lyrics and hugs. You feel warm and fuzzy. Like you are a little kid who just got home after swimming all day. You are tired in the perfect way. You sink into your blankets and fall asleep.\n \nA humming noise wakes you up. You are in the theater. There is music playing. You aren\u2019t a kid anymore. \n\nYou had a drink at dinner before the concert. \n\nYou swallowed it with ease. \n\n\nMarch 20, 1990\n\nThe hum of the radio filled the sweet night air. Louise and Miles lounged in the bed of his beat-up pickup. It was his father's old farm truck, a janky, rusty thing that only ran when it felt like it, but Miles loved it. It was his pride and joy. Any weekend he wasn\u2019t with Louise, he was fixing it up; he would spend hours under the body of that thing, coming into the house reeking of oil and exhaust. Mrs. Wilson hated it; she feared for the safety of her nice beige carpet and the cleanliness of his jeans.\n\nIt was freshly spring; it was dry and warm for the first time this year. They were laying on his mother\u2019s old picnic blanket, something she probably wouldn\u2019t care for if she knew. It was pitch black, the only thing that illuminated them were the stars and the faint light of Louise\u2019s kitchen light. They had returned from cruising around town, and neither wanted to go inside yet. They had been lulled into a comfortable silence, their hands knotted together perfectly. And then, suddenly, Louise had a question.\n\n\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d \n\n\u201cLouise\u2026\u201d Miles sighed.\n\nNervousness leaked into her tone, \u201cI was just making sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t hate you? Even though we\u2019re dating?\u201d Miles scoffed, \u201cWhy would I be with you if I hated you? What would I gain from that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if you were using me?\u201d Louise said, her voice small.\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Miles sat up and put his head in his hands, \u201c\u2018What if\u2019 Louise, when have I ever, in our entire lives, used you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2014\u201d she started.\n\n\u201cIf you are basing your fear of our relationship on \u2018what ifs,\u2019 maybe we shouldn\u2019t be together. You are so absorbed in your past that it's like you aren\u2019t even seeing me, not now, not in the present,\u201d Miles shot at her.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Louise said, her voice breaking with emotion. \n\nMiles took a deep breath, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what happened, and I get that healing is a hard and long process. But, Louise, I\u2019m tired, too. \u201d\n\nHot, stinging tears rolled down Louise\u2019s face, wetting the blanket, \u201cI know you love me. Sometimes I\u2019m just scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you scared?\u201d Miles whispered.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she sniffled, \u201cI am what I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are what you are,\u201d Miles repeated, \u201cAnd I\u2019m tired of pretendning I can change that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen stop.\u201d\n\nLouise wiped the tears off her face and climbed out of the truck. Her receding footsteps echoed in Miles' head, a pounding that sounded eerily like his heartbeat\u2014 fast and hard. Miles sat there for a long while. The radio was still on, blasting The Smiths.\n\t\n\nTrumpets blast loud, then louder. You think your eardrum might burst. Then, the music lulls to a stop. The lights do not come on. It is like the entire world has stopped to take a breath. One big inhale. You fill your lungs. The air smells like honeysuckle. \n\nYou are a child running in the yard with your dog. You are barefoot. You step on a bee. You limp into the house and cry to your mother. She puts your foot on ice. \n\nYou will never feel the grass on your bare foot again. You do not need to learn the lesson twice.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n", "index": "red11_s13_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red11_s13_c0_", "comment_text": "\nYou sit shoulder to shoulder in the auditorium. Your scratchy black suit rubs against two arms wrapped in finer material. You shift in your seat, moving uncomfortably in the plush chair beneath you. Your leg is shaking; you are anxious for the show to begin. The massive room rumbles with murmurs of conversation\u2014inquisitions about how the show will be, complaints of hunger, protests of too-tight clothing, and ties choking necks. You are silent. \n\t\n\nSeptember 6, 1981\n\nLouise trudged up the dusty gravel path towards her home, a rotted trailer perched atop a steep hill. The bus driver never ventured up the path, leaving Louise to trek the quarter mile herself. She stopped momentarily and watched as the yellow bus sped away; the shadow of a lone hand waved her goodbye. She waved back, too late for anyone to see it, \u201cBye, Miles.\u201d\n\nHer house stank of cigarette smoke. The soft shag carpet collected to odor, spitting it out with every step. The windows and walls were yellowed with nicotine. The trailer was quiet; the constant droning of the radiator was the only thing to be heard. Louise set her backpack down and walked into the kitchen to make herself dinner. Her mother wouldn\u2019t be home for several hours, and school lunch was never enough. \n\nAfter Louise ate a measly bowl of microwaved leftover Kraft, she sat down to do her homework. She pulled out the math sheet they had gotten that day. Numbers shifted and combined; they peeled off the page and swam around her. Louise needed help. She dialed a number she knew by heart. The line rang.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d a woman\u2019s voice answered, her voice slightly distorted through the phone.\n\n\u201cHi, Mrs. Wilson,\u201d Louise said in a timid voice.\n\n\u201cHi, Louise,\u201d Mrs. Wilson\u2019s voice softened, \u201cI\u2019ll get him for you.\u201d\n\nLouise heard her muffled yell, \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey Louise! What\u2019s up?\u201d a boy's voice asked.\n\n\u201cHi, Miles. Have you done your math homework?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it right now.\u201d\n\nLouise stretched the cord to where she sat at the table, \u201cGreat.\u201d\n\n\nThe lights dim, and silence washes over the crowd. The curtains part. Fifty people in tuxedos sit on stage, various instruments in hand. The conductor stands tall. He introduces the orchestra, lifts his gloved hands, and the music begins. \n\n\nMarch 9, 1983\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still coming, right?\u201d Miles questioned nervously.\n\n\u201cYes, Miles, I\u2019m still coming,\u201d Louise rolled her eyes before smiling at him.\n\nMiles relaxed a little bit, \u201cOkay, good.\u201d\n\nMiles had mousy brown hair that was cut short. His dad had served in the military, so he thought this boy should have a \u2018man\u2019s haircut.\u2019 He was tan even in the wintertime. He had bright hazel eyes that glowed electric green in the sunlight. Louise was about an inch taller than Miles, a fact she was immensely proud of. \n\nThe pair walked down the school hallway. It was Friday. Wonderful, glorious Friday. Louise rejoiced in the days that she didn\u2019t have to come into school and pretend she liked people\u2014 pretend she liked anything, really. She hated the teachers, her peers, the hospital grey of the walls. She liked Miles. He ignored the cigarette stink of her clothes and the rudeness of her tone. \n\nToday was Miles\u2019 birthday. He\u2019ll be ten. Miles had invited everyone to the party; there would be a bounce house. He\u2019s \u2018going all out for the big one o\u2019 as he kept telling Louise. She was nervous about the party; her gift was okay at best, and she dreaded the disappointed but polite smile she knew Miles would pull. \n\n\u201cMy mom will be here right after school to pick us up. You know what my mom\u2019s car looks like, right?\u201d Miles asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, I remember.\u201d \n\nLousie walked out to Mrs. Wilson\u2019s car, a sleek, silver Porsche; Louise felt like a celebrity when she rode in it\u2014rich and important. \n\n\u201cHi, Louise,\u201d Mrs. Wilson smiled, \u201cHow was school?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Mrs. Wilson. It was good.\u201d\n\nLouise settled into the plush leather seats and set her backpack in front of her. They sat in silence for a moment, the soft drum of the radio filling the air. Miles ripped open the door, excitement lighting up his face. He sat down, his position mirroring Louise\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHey, buddy. How was your day?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked.\n\n\u201cIt was great, Mom,\u201d he smiled.\n\nShe smiled back warmly, \u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nMrs. Wilson pulled out of the parking lot, Louise and Miles chatted idly about school and the party. After a short while, they pulled up to Miles\u2019 house\u2014a two-story white house with columns in front. Louise loved it. Sometimes, during sleepovers, late at night, she pretended it was hers. She quietly walked down hallways, running her fingertips across the smooth wallpaper. She felt the soft carpet on her bare toes and imagined it knew the shape and weight of her foot. She opened the fridge and pretended not to be surprised at the selection of food that awaited her. Then, she would return to Miles\u2019 room and lie down next to him in the sleeping bag he lent her, stare up at the tiny glowing stars stuck on his ceiling, and pretend it was her and her mom that put them up\u2014 that it was her mom that held the step stool for her so she wouldn't fall. \n\nLouise and Miles hopped out of the car, ran up to his room, and plopped their bags down. They still had a few hours before their other classmates would arrive. They sat on the ground and leaned against the bed. Louise pulled out Miles\u2019 gift from her bag and handed the small gift bag to him, \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not time for the party,\u201d Miles said, confusion evident in his voice. \n\nLouise shrugged, \u201cI wanted to give it to you now.\u201d\n\nMiles smiled at her before gently taking the tissue paper out of the bag and reaching in. He pulled out a light blue paper swan. Lousie had spent hours getting the folds just right so the paper was sharp instead of rumpled. It was beautiful. \n\n\u201cLouise,\u201d Miles started, his face curved into a slight frown, like he was about to cry, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you really like it?\u201d Louise asked nervously; she fidgeted with her fingernails. \n\nMiles set the swan down gently and dove towards her, wrapping her in a hug, \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\nThe party was a hit. Louise nearly made herself sick from the combination of an ungodly amount of candy and jumping in the bounce house. Almost everyone from their class was there, shoving presents in Miles\u2019 hands before running to the snacks and entertainment. Night fell, and Louise climbed in the Porsche again, though it was just her and Mrs. Wilson this time. \n\n\u201cDid you have a good time, Louise?\u201d she asked, making eye contact through the rearview mirror.\n \n\u201cYeah, it was awesome. Thank you for having me,\u201d Louise responded, polite as ever. \n\n\u201cOh, you are always welcome, sweetie,\u201d Mrs. Wilson smiled. \n\nLouise looked out the window for the rest of the drive, the stars blurring against the black night sky. They pulled up to Louise\u2019s house; her driveway was empty.\n\n\u201cAre you sure you are okay until your mom gets here?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked. \n\nLouise smiled fakely, \u201cYeah I\u2019ll be alright. She should be home soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, sweetheart.\u201d\n\nLouise climbed out of the car and walked to her door. She looked back before stepping inside\u2014Mrs. Wilson\u2019s face was a mirage of pity and sympathy. Louise waved and stepped inside, choking down guilt as she did. \n\n\nThe sweet sound of a violin fills your ears\u2014a lone instrument bellowing a quiet tune. It starts slow\u2014soft, like a warm hand caressing your face, a mother wiping away your tears. \n\nYou forget yourself for a moment; you are back in your childhood home, where your bed is indented with your shape. You smell your favorite meal being cooked downstairs. You hear your mother humming her favorite song from the kitchen. Your father isn\u2019t home yet. You are excited to see him. \n\nYou wish it were real. \n\nIt is not. \n\n\nJune 11, 1984\n\nLouise was having a terrible day. Her mother was off work and slumming around the house\u2014 she was like a ghost in her own home, and she had nothing to do. They didn\u2019t have cable this month, so Louise\u2019s options were to sit in her bed and do nothing or visit Miles. She chose the latter. Louise bid her mom a short goodbye, telling her where she was going and not much else, and peddled off on her bike. She was drenched by the time she arrived at Miles\u2019 house. So she ditched her bike in the grass and ran to ring the doorbell. Mrs. Wilson answered.\n\n\u201cOh. Hello, Louise,\u201d she smiled.\n\nMrs. Wilson was a nice woman, and Louise absolutely loved her. She was as thin as a twig but had a motherly warmth about her that Louise itched for. Miles was the spitting image of her, matching her tanned skin and bright eyes. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Miles isn\u2019t here,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Louise said, disappointment swirling around her tongue. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hun,\u201d Mrs. Wilson gave her a sympathetic look, \u201cHe\u2019s out with his dad fishing for the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Louise lied and started to walk back to where she abandoned her bike. \n\n\u201cWait a second, sweetheart,\u201d she called, \u201cDo you want some lemonade? I\u2019d hate to just send you home after you rode all this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, Mrs. Wilson. Thank you.\u201d\n\nLouise followed her into the kitchen and sat down at one of the barstools to wait. It wasn\u2019t long before she had a nice tall glass of lemonade in front of her and a bag of chips in her hand. \n\n\u201cYou can go watch TV if you want,\u201d Mrs. Wilson smiled at her, \u201cI\u2019ll be out in the garden if you ever need anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, thank you,\u201d Louise said. \n\nShe wandered into the living room, and the plush carpet under her feet felt amazing. She flicked on the television and turned it to her favorite cartoon station. She did feel strange behaving like she lived there, especially when the house was empty, but her desire to relax in the air conditioning trumped the feeling. She mindlessly watched Jerry outsmart Tom in the comfort of a home that wasn\u2019t her\u2019s. \n\nLouise finished her snack but didn\u2019t feel like returning home; she knew her mother would be there, heating the house with cigarettes and sex. Mary had moved on from Steve quickly. \nSo, she laid down and continued watching television. At some point, she fell asleep. Louise woke up to the soft voices of Miles\u2019 parents talking in the kitchen. Someone had turned the TV off and taken her dishes. She could hear the shower running upstairs. Louise had no idea what time it was; the sun was now visible in the living room windows, the sky was orange. She was about to get up and ask Mrs. Wilson when she heard her name. Miles\u2019 parents were talking about her. She got up as quietly as she could and snuck closer to the swinging kitchen door.  \n\n\u201cIs there something we can do?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked her husband in a concerned tone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Jenny,\u201d Mr. Wilson responded, \u201cShe just has a hard life, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like we should do more for her.\u201d\n\nMr. Wilson sighed, \u201cWe can only help her when she\u2019s here. You know what Mary thinks about handouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, poor Mary,\u201d Mrs. Wilson said, her tone sympathetic, \u201cI should call her and tell her Louise is gonna stay the night.\u201d\n\nLouise heard footsteps sound in her direction. She ran as softly as she could back to her position on the couch, feigning sleep. Mrs. Wilson swung open the door and picked up the phone that hung on the wall next to it. Louise heard the click-clack of buttons being pressed, the muffled ringing, and then her mother\u2019s voice on the other line. \n\n\u201cHey, Mary,\u201d Mrs. Wilson said, \u201cIs it alright if Louise stays here tonight? She passed out on the couch and I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be smart to have her ride home now.\u201d\n\nLousie couldn\u2019t hear her mother's exact words, but she must have said it was fine because the next thing Louise knew, she was being picked up and carried up the stairs. Mrs. Wilson set her down in a room she was unfamiliar with. She figured it was the guest room. Mrs. Wilson kissed Louise gently on her forehead and told her goodnight in a whispered tone. Louise missed her mother. \n\nThe room was bird-themed. The walls were painted a dark navy, and a thin metal peacock stared at her from where it hung. A copy of the NATO phonetic alphabet was hanging, too. It must have been Miles\u2019 old room. Louise remembered when he came to school in second grade and told her he was moving into the attic. There was an opening to the roof up there, and Miles was in love with the idea of sitting up there and watching the sun set and rise. \n\nMiles was in love with a lot when he was little\u2014 the sun and sky, the warmth of his mother\u2019s hugs, iced tea on a hot day. Louise didn\u2019t think she was in love with anything. She didn\u2019t think she ever would be. Louise was almost asleep, the plush, silky sheets lulling her into another bout of slumber. Her door squeaked open. Miles\u2019 small frame was a shadow in the doorway. He looked so small. He didn\u2019t walk into the room, choosing to loom in the entrance. \n\n\u201cGoodnight, Louise,\u201d he said in a small voice. \n\n\u201cGoodnight, Miles.\u201d\n\n\nWhen you were little, you thought everything was perfect. The world was alive with hope and magic. Everyone got along, and there was nothing wrong. \n\nOf course, now you know that is not true. But a part of you, a little tiny part, wants to go back to when you didn\u2019t know. When life was good, and you didn\u2019t know better. \n\nThat\u2019s how the music sounds. Like you are an innocent kid sitting on the front porch eating a red cherry popsicle. The juice runs down your face. It looks like blood. \n\n\nJuly 15, 1984\n\nLouise was once again sitting in the back seat of the Wilsons\u2019 Porsche, but this time, she was without a backpack-- sans her school clothes. She wore the itchy Easter dress her grandmother had gotten her two years prior. Louise wore it to her funeral. She stuck out like a sore thumb, a pastel beacon amongst the waves of black. \nIt was Sunday\u2014the Lord\u2019s Day, as Mrs. Wilson had told her. Louise hadn\u2019t been inside a church for a good reason\u2014she\u2019d never been to a regular Sunday mass. But last night, she had stayed the night at Miles\u2019, so she was on her way to church. There were no ifs, ands, or buts about it. \n\nThey pulled into the parking lot, the ancient steeple looming over the car. Louise could recognize that it was a beautiful church, but the body of Christ hanging in the stained glass window did nothing to settle her nervous stomach. The pop of car doors sounded; there was no going back. \n\nThe wooden pew was uncomfortable, the kneelers even more so. She listened to Miles\u2019 soft whispers of direction and did as he said. She fell and rose when she should; she crossed her arms instead of taking communion, she shook hands with strangers, and mumbled, \u2018Peace be with you.\u2019 \nAnd then it was over, and Louise was waking back to the car, her white flats cutting into her feet. \n\n\u201cWhat did you think, Louise?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked in a kind voice. \n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, \u201cIt was okay. I didn\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll learn,\u201d Mrs. Wilson responded, a promise on the tip of her tongue. \n\nLouise was silent on the ride back; she leaned against the window and watched as trees blurred together in a mirage of green. Louise didn\u2019t know what it was like to believe in God. She thought she felt it there for a moment-- a quiet tingling in the back of her mind. But then she remembered that she wasn\u2019t with her family; the Wilsons were not her parents. She remembered her mom was working a double today so they could have electricity. And what God would think that was fair? Not one Louise wanted to believe in. \n\n\nThe music sounds like the church hymns your mother made you sing. She meant well; she thought she was giving you the gift of her religion. You couldn\u2019t tell her you didn\u2019t want it. It was all she had ever known. \n\nWhat child betrays their mother?\n\n\nMay 21, 1985 \n\nIt was the summer after sixth grade. Lousie and Miles had biked to the pool in town, a desperate attempt to escape the heat. The air was thick and humid, and sweat sprouted from Louise's skin, dampening her shirt and shorts. The sun beamed down on her back; there wasn\u2019t a cloud in sight. The pair parked their bikes out front and ran into the small building. A bored-looking teenager accepted their fifty cents each and let them in. \nThe air reeked of chlorine, and the painted concrete was slick with warm water. Miles and Louise threw their towels down and began to shed their swimsuits. Louise\u2019s hands were shaking with anticipation; she hadn't been to the pool in so long. \n\n\u201cRace you,\u201d Miles said, darting towards the water's edge. \n\n\u201cNo fair,\u201d Louise groaned as she kicked off her flip-flops and ran after him. \n\nLouise heard a distant whistle ringing and a call that running wasn\u2019t allowed before she splashed into the blue depths. The cool water encapsulated her, and goosebumps formed on her skin. She bobbed to the surface and saw Miles climbing out and heading towards the diving board. \n\nThey stayed until the sun was beginning to set; Miles\u2019 mom didn\u2019t like him being out that late on his own yet, so they peddled back home soggy clothes and pruny skin. \n\nWhen Louise returned to her house, it was dark. She could see the kitchen light shining out onto the brown lawn. Steve was home. Louise\u2019s mom, Mary, had picked him up a few months back. He was a short, fat man. His breath always smelled like beer, yeasty and vile. He had dark hair and a beard to match. Her mother claimed she really liked him, but Louise knew she just needed someone to help pay the bills. \n\nOne of the few good things about having kids as young as Louise\u2019s mom had her is that she never had a hard time finding a sleazy older guy to keep around. Being pretty also helped, and Mary sure was pretty. Mary was tall and slender, with long, curly auburn hair. She was covered in freckles and had eyes that glowed emerald green. When Louise was young, Mary would smile often, but as her eyebags grew, her smile faded. She could fake it when needed, but it was never like Louise remembered. \n\nMary and Louise could have been twins\u2014 minus the smile lines she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever have the chance to earn. Maybe that was why, when Louise walked into her kitchen in nothing more than a bathing suit, Steve forced himself on her. \n\nYou clutch the armrest on your chair, digging your nails into the fabric. The music is screeching, a distorted version of what it once was. You want to cry. You think your ears are bleeding. You bite the inside of your cheek, hoping to distract yourself from the perverted disgust mess of noise assaulting you. Your mouth tastes like metal. The urge to stand and walk, no, run, out of the theater is so strong you can hardly bear it.\n \nYou do not get up. \n\n\nMay 22, 1985\n\nMiles called and asked if she wanted to go swimming again. Louise didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him she never wanted to go swimming again, so she lied and said she was sick. Miles was at her door an hour later with a container of homemade cookies and Guess Who. \n\nThe two sit on the floor of Louise\u2019s bedroom, the soft blanket she put down covering the scratchy carpet. Louise\u2019s room was small and dingy. The walls were cracked and stained; she lived out of one small bureau that had been unceremoniously shoved into a corner of the room. Last Christmas, she begged her mother to help her hang lights on the ceiling. They were still up, casting a rainbow glow over the room. It was the only source of light she used. She had a small nightstand piled with pencils and markers; she had long since stained her light pink sheets while drawing. \nCookie crumbles littered the floor. Louise was losing the game; most of her people were still up, while Miles only had about five people left to choose from. He chewed his lip in concentration. Louise usually laughed at him for it; he always seemed to take the board games they played too seriously. This time, she didn\u2019t notice he was doing it. \n\n\u201cDoes your person have brown hair?\u201d Miles questioned.\n\nLouise didn\u2019t respond.\n\u201cLouise? Are you alrigh\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo your parents ever touch you?\u201d Louise said, eyes trained on the floor.\n\nMiles\u2019 face scrunched up in confusion, \u201cYou mean like hugs?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean then?\u201d Miles questioned. \n\nLouise\u2019s eyes fogged up with tears, \u201cNever mind. Let\u2019s just play the game.\u201d\n\nMiles eyed her with sympathetic confusion before realizing what she meant, \u201cLouise\u2026\u201d\n\nHe moved to hug her, but she flinched away from him. Miles sat back; he wasn\u2019t touching her but was close enough for her to feel the heat radiating off of him. Louise sniffled, trying desperately to contain her emotion. \n\n\u201cDo you want me to leave you alone?\u201d Miles whispered.\n\nLouise turned to look at him, her face pale and puffy, \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLouise and Miles sat like that for a long time. When the sun set, he got up and called his mom, begging her to let him stay the night. Louise didn\u2019t hear the conversation, but Mrs. Wilson must have agreed because the next thing she knew, she was being guided to bed, and Miles was settled on the floor next to her, leaning against the bed and holding her hand. \n\n\nThe music turned sweet. It drifted through your ears pleasantly, passing over the cracked, dry blood. A chorus of flutes is playing, light and soft. \n\nIt feels like the pillow in your dorm room, childhood mixed with freedom. \n\nYou know this feeling won\u2019t last. But right now, in this moment, you lay your head down and pretend the world is new. \n\n\nMay 17, 1986\n\nMiles and Louise had biked miles to the movie theater. Miles had begged Louise to see the new movie coming out, one that Louise was less than excited about. He had been to the movies some months before with his mom and had seen the trailer. The next day, he begged her to see it with him when it came out, and she agreed, not knowing anything about it. \n\nMiles was practically giddy with excitement. His eyes glowed with it. The theater was packed; they stood in the line shoulder to shoulder with what must have been every other kid in town. Louise clung to the red crushed velvet rope that segmented the line for dear life. The feeling of so many people pressed up against her was nauseating. She screwed her eyes shut, pushing down a wave of oncoming dizziness. Before she knew it she was being pulled along to the ticket stand. Miles produced them with a broad smile on his face, \u201cTwo for Top Gun.\u201d\n\nHe then bought a giant thing of buttery popcorn and two glass Cokes. They made their way to their seats and waited for the movie to begin. Miles shoved popcorn in his mouth, salty yellow kernels going everywhere. Trailers for various movies played on the big screen\u2014 Miles leaned over nearly every time and asked Louise if she would go with him. She said yes every time. \n\nThe movie was beautiful. It was nothing like Louise had ever seen before; it made her yearn for the sky, the feeling of freedom unlike anything she would ever know. And then it was tragic, and she was crying in her seat, wailing over someone she didn\u2019t know. Begging him to wake up. \n\nThey left in silence, walking to the bike rack to a chorus of shoes against pavement. They stalled for a moment before getting onto their bikes and parting their ways.\n\n\u201cWhat would you do if I died?\u201d Miles said, his eyes trained on Louise\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d her eyes were red and puffy, \u201cI don\u2019t think I could go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d Miles agreed.\n\nMiles stared at her for a beat before getting on his bike and peddling home. Louise imagined her life without Miles on the way home. Sharp metal against skin, blood seeping into water. She didn\u2019t think it would be much of a life. \n\n\nWhen you were in 6th grade, you played the clarinet. You always had a fondness for them.\n\nThey were the only ones playing, the dulcet tones of a wooden reed against black plastic. The song was picking up pace, like a heartbeat. \n\nIn 6th grade band, you sat next to a girl you liked. She was better at the instrument than you. You didn\u2019t care. You remember taking her to the winter formal and carrying her shoes when her feet got sore. You remember your dad giving you the talk before you went. \n\nYou haven\u2019t seen her in years. You wonder how she\u2019s doing. \n\nThe clarinets are done with their solo. You forget about her again. \n\n\nAugust 21, 1987\n\nThis year, Louise\u2019s birthday fell on the first day of school. She dressed nicer than usual, an attempt at vanity that made her hate herself. Miles had given her a music box that played You Are My Sunshine. Louise had told him that she missed it when her mom sang it to her before bed. She cried in the bathroom. \n\nAt lunch, she stood in line with a group of girls in her PE class. Miles was a few feet ahead of her, and the kids in her school took cutting in line more seriously than she thought was necessary, so she stayed put. She stood silently while the girls talked about a teacher they didn\u2019t like, choosing instead to eavesdrop on the conversations around her rather than contribute to the one she was in. \n\nBrian Miller\u2019s voice sounded broken and raspy, like a kid with money for cigarettes and not much else. He was a stereotypical bully, big and tall, with an ugly look plastered everywhere he went. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of someone not being in pain. He was talking to Miles, his voice loud enough for Louise to hear from where she was: \u201cWhy do you hang out with that poor girl all the time? Does she give it up easily?\u201d\n\nHis lips were curled in a cruel sneer, showing off his yellow teeth. Miles looked at him, barely visible to Louise over the people between them. Then, suddenly, he wound up and punched Brian square in the face. Louise heard the crunch of his nose being broken\u2014 blood spurted on the floor and onto the onlooking students. Brian grunted in pain, bringing his hand to touch his bloodied face slowly before launching into a vicious returning attack. He only got a few punches on Miles before the nearest teacher pulled him away. \nLouise pushed through the crowd that had formed, leaning down at Miles\u2019 side. His face was nearly unrecognizable; bruises were starting to form already.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do that? Oh my god, Miles, why did you do that?\u201d Louise choked out, tears fogging her vision. \n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Miles tried to smile, blood staining his teeth. \n\nA teacher pushed Louise out of the way, assessing the damage. What felt like seconds later, an ambulance appeared, along with Mrs. Wilson. She was frantic; her hands were shaking with fear. Everything was silent. At some point, everyone had cleared out except Louise. She was standing here like an idiot, staring at Miles\u2019 bloodied face. \n\nLouise felt a strong hand grab her arm, a mother\u2019s hand, \u201cCome on, Louise. You can ride along.\u201d\nMrs. Wilson stood in front of Louise. Her eyes were red, but she had composed herself. Louise\u2019s voice came out as nothing more than a whisper: \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nShe let herself be pulled into the ambulance; the siren was the only thing she could hear. She watched as the EMTs worked, their skilled, gloved hands dancing over his body. \n\n\u201cLouise, he\u2019s gonna be okay,\u201d Mrs. Wilson whispered in her ear, \u201cCome here.\u201d\n\nShe pulled Louise into a hug, hiding her view of Miles. Louise closed her eyes against Mrs. Wilson, willing her breath to slow. They stopped abruptly at the hospital. Louise and Mrs. Wilson climbed out and watched as nurses and interns swarmed Miles\u2019 gurney. They were ushered to the waiting room and sat down on hard, terribly patterned chairs. At some point, Mrs. Wilson called Louise\u2019s mother to tell her where she was. \nA doctor brought them to Miles\u2019 room after over an hour. His face had been cleaned and bandaged, and his nose was clearly broken.\n \n\u201cLouise,\u201d Miles said, his eyes lighting up. \n\n\u201cMiles,\u201d Louise responded, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m right as rain,\u201d he tried to smile but winced.\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Miles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he reassured her, reaching up to squeeze her hand.\n\nThey stood like that until Louise\u2019s mom came to get her. Louise crawled into Mary\u2019s beat-up Sedan and slumped in the seat. \n\n\u201cAre you okay, baby?\u201d Mary asked her.\n\n\u201cMom, what if he died?\u201d Louise ignored the question. \n\nMary sighed, \u201cSweetheart he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s just got a concussion and a broken nose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Louise said, \u201cI know he\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nThe bags under Mary\u2019s eyes seemed heavier today, and her face seemed more wrinkled. Louise looked more like her every day. \n\n\nThe music takes on a somber tone. Long, drawn-out notes fill the air. You think of your mother again, the way she looked sunken in her hospital bed\u2014 decaying before your eyes. You remember the feel of her bony, pale hands wiping away your tears in her final moments. \n\nIt was the first time you saw your dad cry.\n\nThe wail of violin chokes you. \n\n\nDecember 17, 1988\n\nLouise was lying on her back in Miles\u2019 bed. He\u2019s had the same one since they were kids; the box springs creak under their weight. Miles was above her, his eyes boring holes in hers. His parents were not home, the house was eerily quiet\u2014 the ambient creaking distracting Louise. \nHis record player sang sweet music from his desk. His room was cluttered with dirty clothes and various knick-knacks. A blue paper swan sat on his bookshelf next to his worn copy of The Hobbit. His closet was open, casting weird shadows along the walls. The lights were off.\n \nThe soft touch of Miles\u2019 lips trailed down her chest to her stomach. She tried to push down the nausea\u2014 make her body stop squirming. Her hand clutched his shoulder tightly. He had asked if this was okay. She had said yes. \n\nLouise felt another article of clothing being slid off her body. She was cold. Her eyes shot to the ceiling. One glowing star was still stuck on the popcorn texture. Miles had taken them off the year before. He had missed one. Louise felt the heat of salty water run down her face into the soft pillow. She hated herself. \n\n\u2018Dear God,\u2019 she thought, \u2018if you can hear me please, please just let me be okay. Let me want this.\u2019\n\nShe didn\u2019t receive a response. God wasn\u2019t listening. It was just her and Miles in a house too big, in a world too small. \n\n\u201cLouise?\u201d Miles said, his voice laced with concern, \u201cHey. Are you okay?\u201d\n\nAll she could muster was an \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 before getting up, running into the bathroom, and emptying her stomach into the toilet. \n\nThe air stunk of sour yeast.\n\t\n\nThe music bounced up and down, building up to its crescendo. Excitement filled your chest, the entire orchestra almost all playing now. \n\nA chorus of brass filled the air\u2014French horns and trumpets battle for dominance on stage. Your eyes are wide in anticipation; you have waited the entire night for this. \n\nYou are sixteen, and you and your friends sit around a fire, passing a bottle of Jack around. It is the Friday before school starts. You wanted one last night of summer fun before your life filled with books and assignments. \n\nThe whiskey burns a path down your throat. It makes you nauseous. You get so drunk you can\u2019t stand up. Your vision blurs as you stumble into the surrounding woods. You are alone. You vomit more than you thought was possible. You think you are going to die. You miss your mom.\n\nYou haven't drank since. \n\nYou don\u2019t think you ever will. \n\n\nAugust 4, 1989\n\nThe granite bar was cool under Louise\u2019s fingertips. She sat in Miles\u2019 kitchen, spinning nervously on the metal bar stool. She was chewing her lip; her mouth tasted like blood. Miles sat next to her, his demeanor the exact opposite of Louise\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI mean, come on, Louise. What are you gonna do with your life?\u201d Mrs. Wilson lectured her. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Louise mumbled. \n\nMrs. Wilson sighed, \u201cMiles has wanted to be a pilot since he was eight. What do you want?\u201d\n\nLouise took a deep breath, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be like Miles. But I\u2019m not your fucking kid so leave me alone.\u201d\n\nLouise stood up and stomped up the stairs. She heard Mrs. Wilson yelling her name, but she didn\u2019t turn around. She buried herself in Miles\u2019 bed, wrapping herself in his soft comforter. Louis heard the stairs creak with weight and then a knock on the door. \n\n\u201cLouise, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Miles said, walking into the room.\n\nLouise sat up, her face dry, \u201cWhy are you sorry? You didn\u2019t yell at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still feel sorry,\u201d he said as he sat down next to her.\n\nLouise took a deep breath and leaned on his shoulder. Miles rested his head against hers, \u201cShe loves you, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe just wants you to do well,\u201d Miles said. \n\n\u201cShe wants me to be better than my mother,\u201d Louise corrected.\n\n\u201cIs that so bad?\u201d\n\n\nThe music doesn\u2019t matter right now. You are fifteen, and your father is yelling at you about your future. You don\u2019t know what you want to do. You want to be better than him. \n\nHe backhands you.\n\nThe arm of the person next to you brushes against yours. You jump. The conductor's hands are blurry with movement. The theater is alive with sound. \n\nYou miss your dad. \n\n\nFebruary 14, 1990\n\nLouise and Miles sat across from each other in a restaurant that was too nice for the amount of money they brought. Louise ran her fingers across the laminated menu, fidgeting nervously with the edge of the paper. The restaurant was packed, Miles had made the reservations months in advance.\n\n\u201cDo you know what you want?\u201d Miles asked.\n\nLouise pursed her lips, \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get the chicken piccata.\u201d\n\nMiles eyed the menu, \u201cThat looks good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you gonna get?\u201d she returned the question.\n\nMiles smiled, almost boyishly, \u201cThe steak.\u201d\n\nLouise hummed in response.  She set her menu down and reached for her water glass, running her finger across the rim. Condensation dripped down outside the glass, her fingerprints marking the surface. \n\n\u201cAre you excited about prom?\u201d Miles asked.\n\nLouise laughed a little, \u201cDo we really have nothing else to talk about other than a dance in two months?\u201d\n\nMiles rolled his eyes playfully, \u201cI guess not. What did we talk about when we were kids?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have honestly no idea,\u201d Louise smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t think we talked a lot. We mostly played.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did play an ungodly amount of Donkey Kong.\u201d\n\nLouise chuckled, \u201cGod, was that game even good? Or were we just kids?\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly have no idea,\u201d Miles smiled. \n\nThe waiter came by and took their order, collecting their menus and refreshing their drinks. It wasn\u2019t long before their food arrived; the plates were decedent and beautiful. They left the restaurant with doggy bags in hand and significantly poorer than when they walked in. Louise clambered into Miles\u2019 truck and waited for Miles to start it. But he didn\u2019t. He was staring at her instead. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked incredulously. \n\nHe smiled at her, \u201cI have something for you.\u201d\n\nHer face fell in surprise, \u201cMiles, you told me the dinner was a gift.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Miles shrugged.\nHe reached into his pocket and produced a small velvet box. She took it gingerly into her hands, excitement boiling in her chest. She opened the box softly and found two silver rings. One was engraved with \u2018Miles,\u2019 and the other said \u2018Louise.\u2019 Miles picked up the one that said his name and handed it to her. \n\n\u201cThis one is for you,\u201d he looked at her with huge puppy-dog eyes, \u201cAnd the other one is for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiles\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked nervously.\n\nShe melted, \u201cI love it. I love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he said, leaning in and kissing her sweetly. \n\n\u201cAre your parents home?\u201d she asked against his lips.\n\n\u201cNo, they won\u2019t be home in hours.\u201d\n\nThis time was different than the first. No bile rose up into Louise\u2019s throat; she didn\u2019t have to repress her squirming body. The air smelled like clean linen\u2014 fresh and new. \n\n\nYou are crying, and you don\u2019t know why. The music sounds more like singing now, wrapping you in lyrics and hugs. You feel warm and fuzzy. Like you are a little kid who just got home after swimming all day. You are tired in the perfect way. You sink into your blankets and fall asleep.\n \nA humming noise wakes you up. You are in the theater. There is music playing. You aren\u2019t a kid anymore. \n\nYou had a drink at dinner before the concert. \n\nYou swallowed it with ease. \n\n\nMarch 20, 1990\n\nThe hum of the radio filled the sweet night air. Louise and Miles lounged in the bed of his beat-up pickup. It was his father's old farm truck, a janky, rusty thing that only ran when it felt like it, but Miles loved it. It was his pride and joy. Any weekend he wasn\u2019t with Louise, he was fixing it up; he would spend hours under the body of that thing, coming into the house reeking of oil and exhaust. Mrs. Wilson hated it; she feared for the safety of her nice beige carpet and the cleanliness of his jeans.\n\nIt was freshly spring; it was dry and warm for the first time this year. They were laying on his mother\u2019s old picnic blanket, something she probably wouldn\u2019t care for if she knew. It was pitch black, the only thing that illuminated them were the stars and the faint light of Louise\u2019s kitchen light. They had returned from cruising around town, and neither wanted to go inside yet. They had been lulled into a comfortable silence, their hands knotted together perfectly. And then, suddenly, Louise had a question.\n\n\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d \n\n\u201cLouise\u2026\u201d Miles sighed.\n\nNervousness leaked into her tone, \u201cI was just making sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t hate you? Even though we\u2019re dating?\u201d Miles scoffed, \u201cWhy would I be with you if I hated you? What would I gain from that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if you were using me?\u201d Louise said, her voice small.\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Miles sat up and put his head in his hands, \u201c\u2018What if\u2019 Louise, when have I ever, in our entire lives, used you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2014\u201d she started.\n\n\u201cIf you are basing your fear of our relationship on \u2018what ifs,\u2019 maybe we shouldn\u2019t be together. You are so absorbed in your past that it's like you aren\u2019t even seeing me, not now, not in the present,\u201d Miles shot at her.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Louise said, her voice breaking with emotion. \n\nMiles took a deep breath, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what happened, and I get that healing is a hard and long process. But, Louise, I\u2019m tired, too. \u201d\n\nHot, stinging tears rolled down Louise\u2019s face, wetting the blanket, \u201cI know you love me. Sometimes I\u2019m just scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you scared?\u201d Miles whispered.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she sniffled, \u201cI am what I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are what you are,\u201d Miles repeated, \u201cAnd I\u2019m tired of pretendning I can change that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen stop.\u201d\n\nLouise wiped the tears off her face and climbed out of the truck. Her receding footsteps echoed in Miles' head, a pounding that sounded eerily like his heartbeat\u2014 fast and hard. Miles sat there for a long while. The radio was still on, blasting The Smiths.\n\t\n\nTrumpets blast loud, then louder. You think your eardrum might burst. Then, the music lulls to a stop. The lights do not come on. It is like the entire world has stopped to take a breath. One big inhale. You fill your lungs. The air smells like honeysuckle. \n\nYou are a child running in the yard with your dog. You are barefoot. You step on a bee. You limp into the house and cry to your mother. She puts your foot on ice. \n\nYou will never feel the grass on your bare foot again. You do not need to learn the lesson twice.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n", "comment_created_utc": 1714350534.0, "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

You are silent. \n\t\n\nSeptember 6, 1981\n\nLouise trudged up the dusty gravel path towards her home, a rotted trailer perched atop a steep hill. The bus driver never ventured up the path, leaving Louise to trek the quarter mile herself. She stopped momentarily and watched as the yellow bus sped away; the shadow of a lone hand waved her goodbye. She waved back, too late for anyone to see it, \u201cBye, Miles.\u201d\n\nHer house stank of cigarette smoke. The soft shag carpet collected to odor, spitting it out with every step. The windows and walls were yellowed with nicotine. The trailer was quiet; the constant droning of the radiator was the only thing to be heard. Louise set her backpack down and walked into the kitchen to make herself dinner. Her mother wouldn\u2019t be home for several hours, and school lunch was never enough. \n\nAfter Louise ate a measly bowl of microwaved leftover Kraft, she sat down to do her homework. She pulled out the math sheet they had gotten that day. Numbers shifted and combined; they peeled off the page and swam around her. Louise needed help. She dialed a number she knew by heart. The line rang.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d a woman\u2019s voice answered, her voice slightly distorted through the phone.\n\n\u201cHi, Mrs. Wilson,\u201d Louise said in a timid voice.\n\n\u201cHi, Louise,\u201d Mrs. Wilson\u2019s voice softened, \u201cI\u2019ll get him for you.\u201d\n\nLouise heard her muffled yell, \u201cThank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey Louise! What\u2019s up?\u201d a boy's voice asked.\n\n\u201cHi, Miles. Have you done your math homework?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it right now.\u201d\n\nLouise stretched the cord to where she sat at the table, \u201cGreat.\u201d\n\n\nThe lights dim, and silence washes over the crowd. The curtains part. Fifty people in tuxedos sit on stage, various instruments in hand. The conductor stands tall. He introduces the orchestra, lifts his gloved hands, and the music begins. \n\n\nMarch 9, 1983\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re still coming, right?\u201d Miles questioned nervously.\n\n\u201cYes, Miles, I\u2019m still coming,\u201d Louise rolled her eyes before smiling at him.\n\nMiles relaxed a little bit, \u201cOkay, good.\u201d\n\nMiles had mousy brown hair that was cut short. His dad had served in the military, so he thought this boy should have a \u2018man\u2019s haircut.\u2019 He was tan even in the wintertime. He had bright hazel eyes that glowed electric green in the sunlight. Louise was about an inch taller than Miles, a fact she was immensely proud of. \n\nThe pair walked down the school hallway. It was Friday. Wonderful, glorious Friday. Louise rejoiced in the days that she didn\u2019t have to come into school and pretend she liked people\u2014 pretend she liked anything, really. She hated the teachers, her peers, the hospital grey of the walls. She liked Miles. He ignored the cigarette stink of her clothes and the rudeness of her tone. \n\nToday was Miles\u2019 birthday. He\u2019ll be ten. Miles had invited everyone to the party; there would be a bounce house. He\u2019s \u2018going all out for the big one o\u2019 as he kept telling Louise. She was nervous about the party; her gift was okay at best, and she dreaded the disappointed but polite smile she knew Miles would pull. \n\n\u201cMy mom will be here right after school to pick us up. You know what my mom\u2019s car looks like, right?\u201d Miles asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, I remember.\u201d \n\nLousie walked out to Mrs. Wilson\u2019s car, a sleek, silver Porsche; Louise felt like a celebrity when she rode in it\u2014rich and important. \n\n\u201cHi, Louise,\u201d Mrs. Wilson smiled, \u201cHow was school?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Mrs. Wilson. It was good.\u201d\n\nLouise settled into the plush leather seats and set her backpack in front of her. They sat in silence for a moment, the soft drum of the radio filling the air. Miles ripped open the door, excitement lighting up his face. He sat down, his position mirroring Louise\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHey, buddy. How was your day?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked.\n\n\u201cIt was great, Mom,\u201d he smiled.\n\nShe smiled back warmly, \u201cWell, that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nMrs. Wilson pulled out of the parking lot, Louise and Miles chatted idly about school and the party. After a short while, they pulled up to Miles\u2019 house\u2014a two-story white house with columns in front. Louise loved it. Sometimes, during sleepovers, late at night, she pretended it was hers. She quietly walked down hallways, running her fingertips across the smooth wallpaper. She felt the soft carpet on her bare toes and imagined it knew the shape and weight of her foot. She opened the fridge and pretended not to be surprised at the selection of food that awaited her. Then, she would return to Miles\u2019 room and lie down next to him in the sleeping bag he lent her, stare up at the tiny glowing stars stuck on his ceiling, and pretend it was her and her mom that put them up\u2014 that it was her mom that held the step stool for her so she wouldn't fall. \n\nLouise and Miles hopped out of the car, ran up to his room, and plopped their bags down. They still had a few hours before their other classmates would arrive. They sat on the ground and leaned against the bed. Louise pulled out Miles\u2019 gift from her bag and handed the small gift bag to him, \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not time for the party,\u201d Miles said, confusion evident in his voice. \n\nLouise shrugged, \u201cI wanted to give it to you now.\u201d\n\nMiles smiled at her before gently taking the tissue paper out of the bag and reaching in. He pulled out a light blue paper swan. Lousie had spent hours getting the folds just right so the paper was sharp instead of rumpled. It was beautiful. \n\n\u201cLouise,\u201d Miles started, his face curved into a slight frown, like he was about to cry, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you really like it?\u201d Louise asked nervously; she fidgeted with her fingernails. \n\nMiles set the swan down gently and dove towards her, wrapping her in a hug, \u201cI love it.\u201d\n\nThe party was a hit. Louise nearly made herself sick from the combination of an ungodly amount of candy and jumping in the bounce house. Almost everyone from their class was there, shoving presents in Miles\u2019 hands before running to the snacks and entertainment. Night fell, and Louise climbed in the Porsche again, though it was just her and Mrs. Wilson this time. \n\n\u201cDid you have a good time, Louise?\u201d she asked, making eye contact through the rearview mirror.\n \n\u201cYeah, it was awesome. Thank you for having me,\u201d Louise responded, polite as ever. \n\n\u201cOh, you are always welcome, sweetie,\u201d Mrs. Wilson smiled. \n\nLouise looked out the window for the rest of the drive, the stars blurring against the black night sky. They pulled up to Louise\u2019s house; her driveway was empty.\n\n\u201cAre you sure you are okay until your mom gets here?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked. \n\nLouise smiled fakely, \u201cYeah I\u2019ll be alright. She should be home soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, sweetheart.\u201d\n\nLouise climbed out of the car and walked to her door. She looked back before stepping inside\u2014Mrs. Wilson\u2019s face was a mirage of pity and sympathy. Louise waved and stepped inside, choking down guilt as she did. \n\n\nThe sweet sound of a violin fills your ears\u2014a lone instrument bellowing a quiet tune. It starts slow\u2014soft, like a warm hand caressing your face, a mother wiping away your tears. \n\nYou forget yourself for a moment; you are back in your childhood home, where your bed is indented with your shape. You smell your favorite meal being cooked downstairs. You hear your mother humming her favorite song from the kitchen. Your father isn\u2019t home yet. You are excited to see him. \n\nYou wish it were real. \n\nIt is not. \n\n\nJune 11, 1984\n\nLouise was having a terrible day. Her mother was off work and slumming around the house\u2014 she was like a ghost in her own home, and she had nothing to do. They didn\u2019t have cable this month, so Louise\u2019s options were to sit in her bed and do nothing or visit Miles. She chose the latter. Louise bid her mom a short goodbye, telling her where she was going and not much else, and peddled off on her bike. She was drenched by the time she arrived at Miles\u2019 house. So she ditched her bike in the grass and ran to ring the doorbell. Mrs. Wilson answered.\n\n\u201cOh. Hello, Louise,\u201d she smiled.\n\nMrs. Wilson was a nice woman, and Louise absolutely loved her. She was as thin as a twig but had a motherly warmth about her that Louise itched for. Miles was the spitting image of her, matching her tanned skin and bright eyes. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid Miles isn\u2019t here,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Louise said, disappointment swirling around her tongue. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, hun,\u201d Mrs. Wilson gave her a sympathetic look, \u201cHe\u2019s out with his dad fishing for the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Louise lied and started to walk back to where she abandoned her bike. \n\n\u201cWait a second, sweetheart,\u201d she called, \u201cDo you want some lemonade? I\u2019d hate to just send you home after you rode all this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, Mrs. Wilson. Thank you.\u201d\n\nLouise followed her into the kitchen and sat down at one of the barstools to wait. It wasn\u2019t long before she had a nice tall glass of lemonade in front of her and a bag of chips in her hand. \n\n\u201cYou can go watch TV if you want,\u201d Mrs. Wilson smiled at her, \u201cI\u2019ll be out in the garden if you ever need anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, thank you,\u201d Louise said. \n\nShe wandered into the living room, and the plush carpet under her feet felt amazing. She flicked on the television and turned it to her favorite cartoon station. She did feel strange behaving like she lived there, especially when the house was empty, but her desire to relax in the air conditioning trumped the feeling. She mindlessly watched Jerry outsmart Tom in the comfort of a home that wasn\u2019t her\u2019s. \n\nLouise finished her snack but didn\u2019t feel like returning home; she knew her mother would be there, heating the house with cigarettes and sex. Mary had moved on from Steve quickly. \nSo, she laid down and continued watching television. At some point, she fell asleep. Louise woke up to the soft voices of Miles\u2019 parents talking in the kitchen. Someone had turned the TV off and taken her dishes. She could hear the shower running upstairs. Louise had no idea what time it was; the sun was now visible in the living room windows, the sky was orange. She was about to get up and ask Mrs. Wilson when she heard her name. Miles\u2019 parents were talking about her. She got up as quietly as she could and snuck closer to the swinging kitchen door.  \n\n\u201cIs there something we can do?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked her husband in a concerned tone.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, Jenny,\u201d Mr. Wilson responded, \u201cShe just has a hard life, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like we should do more for her.\u201d\n\nMr. Wilson sighed, \u201cWe can only help her when she\u2019s here. You know what Mary thinks about handouts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, poor Mary,\u201d Mrs. Wilson said, her tone sympathetic, \u201cI should call her and tell her Louise is gonna stay the night.\u201d\n\nLouise heard footsteps sound in her direction. She ran as softly as she could back to her position on the couch, feigning sleep. Mrs. Wilson swung open the door and picked up the phone that hung on the wall next to it. Louise heard the click-clack of buttons being pressed, the muffled ringing, and then her mother\u2019s voice on the other line. \n\n\u201cHey, Mary,\u201d Mrs. Wilson said, \u201cIs it alright if Louise stays here tonight? She passed out on the couch and I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be smart to have her ride home now.\u201d\n\nLousie couldn\u2019t hear her mother's exact words, but she must have said it was fine because the next thing Louise knew, she was being picked up and carried up the stairs. Mrs. Wilson set her down in a room she was unfamiliar with. She figured it was the guest room. Mrs. Wilson kissed Louise gently on her forehead and told her goodnight in a whispered tone. Louise missed her mother. \n\nThe room was bird-themed. The walls were painted a dark navy, and a thin metal peacock stared at her from where it hung. A copy of the NATO phonetic alphabet was hanging, too. It must have been Miles\u2019 old room. Louise remembered when he came to school in second grade and told her he was moving into the attic. There was an opening to the roof up there, and Miles was in love with the idea of sitting up there and watching the sun set and rise. \n\nMiles was in love with a lot when he was little\u2014 the sun and sky, the warmth of his mother\u2019s hugs, iced tea on a hot day. Louise didn\u2019t think she was in love with anything. She didn\u2019t think she ever would be. Louise was almost asleep, the plush, silky sheets lulling her into another bout of slumber. Her door squeaked open. Miles\u2019 small frame was a shadow in the doorway. He looked so small. He didn\u2019t walk into the room, choosing to loom in the entrance. \n\n\u201cGoodnight, Louise,\u201d he said in a small voice. \n\n\u201cGoodnight, Miles.\u201d\n\n\nWhen you were little, you thought everything was perfect. The world was alive with hope and magic. Everyone got along, and there was nothing wrong. \n\nOf course, now you know that is not true. But a part of you, a little tiny part, wants to go back to when you didn\u2019t know. When life was good, and you didn\u2019t know better. \n\nThat\u2019s how the music sounds. Like you are an innocent kid sitting on the front porch eating a red cherry popsicle. The juice runs down your face. It looks like blood. \n\n\nJuly 15, 1984\n\nLouise was once again sitting in the back seat of the Wilsons\u2019 Porsche, but this time, she was without a backpack-- sans her school clothes. She wore the itchy Easter dress her grandmother had gotten her two years prior. Louise wore it to her funeral. She stuck out like a sore thumb, a pastel beacon amongst the waves of black. \nIt was Sunday\u2014the Lord\u2019s Day, as Mrs. Wilson had told her. Louise hadn\u2019t been inside a church for a good reason\u2014she\u2019d never been to a regular Sunday mass. But last night, she had stayed the night at Miles\u2019, so she was on her way to church. There were no ifs, ands, or buts about it. \n\nThey pulled into the parking lot, the ancient steeple looming over the car. Louise could recognize that it was a beautiful church, but the body of Christ hanging in the stained glass window did nothing to settle her nervous stomach. The pop of car doors sounded; there was no going back. \n\nThe wooden pew was uncomfortable, the kneelers even more so. She listened to Miles\u2019 soft whispers of direction and did as he said. She fell and rose when she should; she crossed her arms instead of taking communion, she shook hands with strangers, and mumbled, \u2018Peace be with you.\u2019 \nAnd then it was over, and Louise was waking back to the car, her white flats cutting into her feet. \n\n\u201cWhat did you think, Louise?\u201d Mrs. Wilson asked in a kind voice. \n\nShe shrugged her shoulders, \u201cIt was okay. I didn\u2019t really know what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll learn,\u201d Mrs. Wilson responded, a promise on the tip of her tongue. \n\nLouise was silent on the ride back; she leaned against the window and watched as trees blurred together in a mirage of green. Louise didn\u2019t know what it was like to believe in God. She thought she felt it there for a moment-- a quiet tingling in the back of her mind. But then she remembered that she wasn\u2019t with her family; the Wilsons were not her parents. She remembered her mom was working a double today so they could have electricity. And what God would think that was fair? Not one Louise wanted to believe in. \n\n\nThe music sounds like the church hymns your mother made you sing. She meant well; she thought she was giving you the gift of her religion. You couldn\u2019t tell her you didn\u2019t want it. It was all she had ever known. \n\nWhat child betrays their mother?\n\n\nMay 21, 1985 \n\nIt was the summer after sixth grade. Lousie and Miles had biked to the pool in town, a desperate attempt to escape the heat. The air was thick and humid, and sweat sprouted from Louise's skin, dampening her shirt and shorts. The sun beamed down on her back; there wasn\u2019t a cloud in sight. The pair parked their bikes out front and ran into the small building. A bored-looking teenager accepted their fifty cents each and let them in. \nThe air reeked of chlorine, and the painted concrete was slick with warm water. Miles and Louise threw their towels down and began to shed their swimsuits. Louise\u2019s hands were shaking with anticipation; she hadn't been to the pool in so long. \n\n\u201cRace you,\u201d Miles said, darting towards the water's edge. \n\n\u201cNo fair,\u201d Louise groaned as she kicked off her flip-flops and ran after him. \n\nLouise heard a distant whistle ringing and a call that running wasn\u2019t allowed before she splashed into the blue depths. The cool water encapsulated her, and goosebumps formed on her skin. She bobbed to the surface and saw Miles climbing out and heading towards the diving board. \n\nThey stayed until the sun was beginning to set; Miles\u2019 mom didn\u2019t like him being out that late on his own yet, so they peddled back home soggy clothes and pruny skin. \n\nWhen Louise returned to her house, it was dark. She could see the kitchen light shining out onto the brown lawn. Steve was home. Louise\u2019s mom, Mary, had picked him up a few months back. He was a short, fat man. His breath always smelled like beer, yeasty and vile. He had dark hair and a beard to match. Her mother claimed she really liked him, but Louise knew she just needed someone to help pay the bills. \n\nOne of the few good things about having kids as young as Louise\u2019s mom had her is that she never had a hard time finding a sleazy older guy to keep around. Being pretty also helped, and Mary sure was pretty. Mary was tall and slender, with long, curly auburn hair. She was covered in freckles and had eyes that glowed emerald green. When Louise was young, Mary would smile often, but as her eyebags grew, her smile faded. She could fake it when needed, but it was never like Louise remembered. \n\nMary and Louise could have been twins\u2014 minus the smile lines she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever have the chance to earn. Maybe that was why, when Louise walked into her kitchen in nothing more than a bathing suit, Steve forced himself on her. \n\nYou clutch the armrest on your chair, digging your nails into the fabric. The music is screeching, a distorted version of what it once was. You want to cry. You think your ears are bleeding. You bite the inside of your cheek, hoping to distract yourself from the perverted disgust mess of noise assaulting you. Your mouth tastes like metal. The urge to stand and walk, no, run, out of the theater is so strong you can hardly bear it.\n \nYou do not get up. \n\n\nMay 22, 1985\n\nMiles called and asked if she wanted to go swimming again. Louise didn\u2019t have the heart to tell him she never wanted to go swimming again, so she lied and said she was sick. Miles was at her door an hour later with a container of homemade cookies and Guess Who. \n\nThe two sit on the floor of Louise\u2019s bedroom, the soft blanket she put down covering the scratchy carpet. Louise\u2019s room was small and dingy. The walls were cracked and stained; she lived out of one small bureau that had been unceremoniously shoved into a corner of the room. Last Christmas, she begged her mother to help her hang lights on the ceiling. They were still up, casting a rainbow glow over the room. It was the only source of light she used. She had a small nightstand piled with pencils and markers; she had long since stained her light pink sheets while drawing. \nCookie crumbles littered the floor. Louise was losing the game; most of her people were still up, while Miles only had about five people left to choose from. He chewed his lip in concentration. Louise usually laughed at him for it; he always seemed to take the board games they played too seriously. This time, she didn\u2019t notice he was doing it. \n\n\u201cDoes your person have brown hair?\u201d Miles questioned.\n\nLouise didn\u2019t respond.\n\u201cLouise? Are you alrigh\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDo your parents ever touch you?\u201d Louise said, eyes trained on the floor.\n\nMiles\u2019 face scrunched up in confusion, \u201cYou mean like hugs?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean then?\u201d Miles questioned. \n\nLouise\u2019s eyes fogged up with tears, \u201cNever mind. Let\u2019s just play the game.\u201d\n\nMiles eyed her with sympathetic confusion before realizing what she meant, \u201cLouise\u2026\u201d\n\nHe moved to hug her, but she flinched away from him. Miles sat back; he wasn\u2019t touching her but was close enough for her to feel the heat radiating off of him. Louise sniffled, trying desperately to contain her emotion. \n\n\u201cDo you want me to leave you alone?\u201d Miles whispered.\n\nLouise turned to look at him, her face pale and puffy, \u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLouise and Miles sat like that for a long time. When the sun set, he got up and called his mom, begging her to let him stay the night. Louise didn\u2019t hear the conversation, but Mrs. Wilson must have agreed because the next thing she knew, she was being guided to bed, and Miles was settled on the floor next to her, leaning against the bed and holding her hand. \n\n\nThe music turned sweet. It drifted through your ears pleasantly, passing over the cracked, dry blood. A chorus of flutes is playing, light and soft. \n\nIt feels like the pillow in your dorm room, childhood mixed with freedom. \n\nYou know this feeling won\u2019t last. But right now, in this moment, you lay your head down and pretend the world is new. \n\n\nMay 17, 1986\n\nMiles and Louise had biked miles to the movie theater. Miles had begged Louise to see the new movie coming out, one that Louise was less than excited about. He had been to the movies some months before with his mom and had seen the trailer. The next day, he begged her to see it with him when it came out, and she agreed, not knowing anything about it. \n\nMiles was practically giddy with excitement. His eyes glowed with it. The theater was packed; they stood in the line shoulder to shoulder with what must have been every other kid in town. Louise clung to the red crushed velvet rope that segmented the line for dear life. The feeling of so many people pressed up against her was nauseating. She screwed her eyes shut, pushing down a wave of oncoming dizziness. Before she knew it she was being pulled along to the ticket stand. Miles produced them with a broad smile on his face, \u201cTwo for Top Gun.\u201d\n\nHe then bought a giant thing of buttery popcorn and two glass Cokes. They made their way to their seats and waited for the movie to begin. Miles shoved popcorn in his mouth, salty yellow kernels going everywhere. Trailers for various movies played on the big screen\u2014 Miles leaned over nearly every time and asked Louise if she would go with him. She said yes every time. \n\nThe movie was beautiful. It was nothing like Louise had ever seen before; it made her yearn for the sky, the feeling of freedom unlike anything she would ever know. And then it was tragic, and she was crying in her seat, wailing over someone she didn\u2019t know. Begging him to wake up. \n\nThey left in silence, walking to the bike rack to a chorus of shoes against pavement. They stalled for a moment before getting onto their bikes and parting their ways.\n\n\u201cWhat would you do if I died?\u201d Miles said, his eyes trained on Louise\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d her eyes were red and puffy, \u201cI don\u2019t think I could go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe neither,\u201d Miles agreed.\n\nMiles stared at her for a beat before getting on his bike and peddling home. Louise imagined her life without Miles on the way home. Sharp metal against skin, blood seeping into water. She didn\u2019t think it would be much of a life. \n\n\nWhen you were in 6th grade, you played the clarinet. You always had a fondness for them.\n\nThey were the only ones playing, the dulcet tones of a wooden reed against black plastic. The song was picking up pace, like a heartbeat. \n\nIn 6th grade band, you sat next to a girl you liked. She was better at the instrument than you. You didn\u2019t care. You remember taking her to the winter formal and carrying her shoes when her feet got sore. You remember your dad giving you the talk before you went. \n\nYou haven\u2019t seen her in years. You wonder how she\u2019s doing. \n\nThe clarinets are done with their solo. You forget about her again. \n\n\nAugust 21, 1987\n\nThis year, Louise\u2019s birthday fell on the first day of school. She dressed nicer than usual, an attempt at vanity that made her hate herself. Miles had given her a music box that played You Are My Sunshine. Louise had told him that she missed it when her mom sang it to her before bed. She cried in the bathroom. \n\nAt lunch, she stood in line with a group of girls in her PE class. Miles was a few feet ahead of her, and the kids in her school took cutting in line more seriously than she thought was necessary, so she stayed put. She stood silently while the girls talked about a teacher they didn\u2019t like, choosing instead to eavesdrop on the conversations around her rather than contribute to the one she was in. \n\nBrian Miller\u2019s voice sounded broken and raspy, like a kid with money for cigarettes and not much else. He was a stereotypical bully, big and tall, with an ugly look plastered everywhere he went. He couldn\u2019t stand the thought of someone not being in pain. He was talking to Miles, his voice loud enough for Louise to hear from where she was: \u201cWhy do you hang out with that poor girl all the time? Does she give it up easily?\u201d\n\nHis lips were curled in a cruel sneer, showing off his yellow teeth. Miles looked at him, barely visible to Louise over the people between them. Then, suddenly, he wound up and punched Brian square in the face. Louise heard the crunch of his nose being broken\u2014 blood spurted on the floor and onto the onlooking students. Brian grunted in pain, bringing his hand to touch his bloodied face slowly before launching into a vicious returning attack. He only got a few punches on Miles before the nearest teacher pulled him away. \nLouise pushed through the crowd that had formed, leaning down at Miles\u2019 side. His face was nearly unrecognizable; bruises were starting to form already.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do that? Oh my god, Miles, why did you do that?\u201d Louise choked out, tears fogging her vision. \n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Miles tried to smile, blood staining his teeth. \n\nA teacher pushed Louise out of the way, assessing the damage. What felt like seconds later, an ambulance appeared, along with Mrs. Wilson. She was frantic; her hands were shaking with fear. Everything was silent. At some point, everyone had cleared out except Louise. She was standing here like an idiot, staring at Miles\u2019 bloodied face. \n\nLouise felt a strong hand grab her arm, a mother\u2019s hand, \u201cCome on, Louise. You can ride along.\u201d\nMrs. Wilson stood in front of Louise. Her eyes were red, but she had composed herself. Louise\u2019s voice came out as nothing more than a whisper: \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nShe let herself be pulled into the ambulance; the siren was the only thing she could hear. She watched as the EMTs worked, their skilled, gloved hands dancing over his body. \n\n\u201cLouise, he\u2019s gonna be okay,\u201d Mrs. Wilson whispered in her ear, \u201cCome here.\u201d\n\nShe pulled Louise into a hug, hiding her view of Miles. Louise closed her eyes against Mrs. Wilson, willing her breath to slow. They stopped abruptly at the hospital. Louise and Mrs. Wilson climbed out and watched as nurses and interns swarmed Miles\u2019 gurney. They were ushered to the waiting room and sat down on hard, terribly patterned chairs. At some point, Mrs. Wilson called Louise\u2019s mother to tell her where she was. \nA doctor brought them to Miles\u2019 room after over an hour. His face had been cleaned and bandaged, and his nose was clearly broken.\n \n\u201cLouise,\u201d Miles said, his eyes lighting up. \n\n\u201cMiles,\u201d Louise responded, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m right as rain,\u201d he tried to smile but winced.\n \n\u201cDon\u2019t lie to me, Miles.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be okay,\u201d he reassured her, reaching up to squeeze her hand.\n\nThey stood like that until Louise\u2019s mom came to get her. Louise crawled into Mary\u2019s beat-up Sedan and slumped in the seat. \n\n\u201cAre you okay, baby?\u201d Mary asked her.\n\n\u201cMom, what if he died?\u201d Louise ignored the question. \n\nMary sighed, \u201cSweetheart he\u2019s fine. He\u2019s just got a concussion and a broken nose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Louise said, \u201cI know he\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nThe bags under Mary\u2019s eyes seemed heavier today, and her face seemed more wrinkled. Louise looked more like her every day. \n\n\nThe music takes on a somber tone. Long, drawn-out notes fill the air. You think of your mother again, the way she looked sunken in her hospital bed\u2014 decaying before your eyes. You remember the feel of her bony, pale hands wiping away your tears in her final moments. \n\nIt was the first time you saw your dad cry.\n\nThe wail of violin chokes you. \n\n\nDecember 17, 1988\n\nLouise was lying on her back in Miles\u2019 bed. He\u2019s had the same one since they were kids; the box springs creak under their weight. Miles was above her, his eyes boring holes in hers. His parents were not home, the house was eerily quiet\u2014 the ambient creaking distracting Louise. \nHis record player sang sweet music from his desk. His room was cluttered with dirty clothes and various knick-knacks. A blue paper swan sat on his bookshelf next to his worn copy of The Hobbit. His closet was open, casting weird shadows along the walls. The lights were off.\n \nThe soft touch of Miles\u2019 lips trailed down her chest to her stomach. She tried to push down the nausea\u2014 make her body stop squirming. Her hand clutched his shoulder tightly. He had asked if this was okay. She had said yes. \n\nLouise felt another article of clothing being slid off her body. She was cold. Her eyes shot to the ceiling. One glowing star was still stuck on the popcorn texture. Miles had taken them off the year before. He had missed one. Louise felt the heat of salty water run down her face into the soft pillow. She hated herself. \n\n\u2018Dear God,\u2019 she thought, \u2018if you can hear me please, please just let me be okay. Let me want this.\u2019\n\nShe didn\u2019t receive a response. God wasn\u2019t listening. It was just her and Miles in a house too big, in a world too small. \n\n\u201cLouise?\u201d Miles said, his voice laced with concern, \u201cHey. Are you okay?\u201d\n\nAll she could muster was an \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019 before getting up, running into the bathroom, and emptying her stomach into the toilet. \n\nThe air stunk of sour yeast.\n\t\n\nThe music bounced up and down, building up to its crescendo. Excitement filled your chest, the entire orchestra almost all playing now. \n\nA chorus of brass filled the air\u2014French horns and trumpets battle for dominance on stage. Your eyes are wide in anticipation; you have waited the entire night for this. \n\nYou are sixteen, and you and your friends sit around a fire, passing a bottle of Jack around. It is the Friday before school starts. You wanted one last night of summer fun before your life filled with books and assignments. \n\nThe whiskey burns a path down your throat. It makes you nauseous. You get so drunk you can\u2019t stand up. Your vision blurs as you stumble into the surrounding woods. You are alone. You vomit more than you thought was possible. You think you are going to die. You miss your mom.\n\nYou haven't drank since. \n\nYou don\u2019t think you ever will. \n\n\nAugust 4, 1989\n\nThe granite bar was cool under Louise\u2019s fingertips. She sat in Miles\u2019 kitchen, spinning nervously on the metal bar stool. She was chewing her lip; her mouth tasted like blood. Miles sat next to her, his demeanor the exact opposite of Louise\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI mean, come on, Louise. What are you gonna do with your life?\u201d Mrs. Wilson lectured her. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Louise mumbled. \n\nMrs. Wilson sighed, \u201cMiles has wanted to be a pilot since he was eight. What do you want?\u201d\n\nLouise took a deep breath, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be like Miles. But I\u2019m not your fucking kid so leave me alone.\u201d\n\nLouise stood up and stomped up the stairs. She heard Mrs. Wilson yelling her name, but she didn\u2019t turn around. She buried herself in Miles\u2019 bed, wrapping herself in his soft comforter. Louis heard the stairs creak with weight and then a knock on the door. \n\n\u201cLouise, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Miles said, walking into the room.\n\nLouise sat up, her face dry, \u201cWhy are you sorry? You didn\u2019t yell at me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still feel sorry,\u201d he said as he sat down next to her.\n\nLouise took a deep breath and leaned on his shoulder. Miles rested his head against hers, \u201cShe loves you, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe just wants you to do well,\u201d Miles said. \n\n\u201cShe wants me to be better than my mother,\u201d Louise corrected.\n\n\u201cIs that so bad?\u201d\n\n\nThe music doesn\u2019t matter right now. You are fifteen, and your father is yelling at you about your future. You don\u2019t know what you want to do. You want to be better than him. \n\nHe backhands you.\n\nThe arm of the person next to you brushes against yours. You jump. The conductor's hands are blurry with movement. The theater is alive with sound. \n\nYou miss your dad. \n\n\nFebruary 14, 1990\n\nLouise and Miles sat across from each other in a restaurant that was too nice for the amount of money they brought. Louise ran her fingers across the laminated menu, fidgeting nervously with the edge of the paper. The restaurant was packed, Miles had made the reservations months in advance.\n\n\u201cDo you know what you want?\u201d Miles asked.\n\nLouise pursed her lips, \u201cI think I\u2019m gonna get the chicken piccata.\u201d\n\nMiles eyed the menu, \u201cThat looks good.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you gonna get?\u201d she returned the question.\n\nMiles smiled, almost boyishly, \u201cThe steak.\u201d\n\nLouise hummed in response.  She set her menu down and reached for her water glass, running her finger across the rim. Condensation dripped down outside the glass, her fingerprints marking the surface. \n\n\u201cAre you excited about prom?\u201d Miles asked.\n\nLouise laughed a little, \u201cDo we really have nothing else to talk about other than a dance in two months?\u201d\n\nMiles rolled his eyes playfully, \u201cI guess not. What did we talk about when we were kids?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have honestly no idea,\u201d Louise smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t think we talked a lot. We mostly played.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did play an ungodly amount of Donkey Kong.\u201d\n\nLouise chuckled, \u201cGod, was that game even good? Or were we just kids?\u201d\n\n\u201cI honestly have no idea,\u201d Miles smiled. \n\nThe waiter came by and took their order, collecting their menus and refreshing their drinks. It wasn\u2019t long before their food arrived; the plates were decedent and beautiful. They left the restaurant with doggy bags in hand and significantly poorer than when they walked in. Louise clambered into Miles\u2019 truck and waited for Miles to start it. But he didn\u2019t. He was staring at her instead. \n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked incredulously. \n\nHe smiled at her, \u201cI have something for you.\u201d\n\nHer face fell in surprise, \u201cMiles, you told me the dinner was a gift.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Miles shrugged.\nHe reached into his pocket and produced a small velvet box. She took it gingerly into her hands, excitement boiling in her chest. She opened the box softly and found two silver rings. One was engraved with \u2018Miles,\u2019 and the other said \u2018Louise.\u2019 Miles picked up the one that said his name and handed it to her. \n\n\u201cThis one is for you,\u201d he looked at her with huge puppy-dog eyes, \u201cAnd the other one is for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMiles\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d he asked nervously.\n\nShe melted, \u201cI love it. I love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he said, leaning in and kissing her sweetly. \n\n\u201cAre your parents home?\u201d she asked against his lips.\n\n\u201cNo, they won\u2019t be home in hours.\u201d\n\nThis time was different than the first. No bile rose up into Louise\u2019s throat; she didn\u2019t have to repress her squirming body. The air smelled like clean linen\u2014 fresh and new. \n\n\nYou are crying, and you don\u2019t know why. The music sounds more like singing now, wrapping you in lyrics and hugs. You feel warm and fuzzy. Like you are a little kid who just got home after swimming all day. You are tired in the perfect way. You sink into your blankets and fall asleep.\n \nA humming noise wakes you up. You are in the theater. There is music playing. You aren\u2019t a kid anymore. \n\nYou had a drink at dinner before the concert. \n\nYou swallowed it with ease. \n\n\nMarch 20, 1990\n\nThe hum of the radio filled the sweet night air. Louise and Miles lounged in the bed of his beat-up pickup. It was his father's old farm truck, a janky, rusty thing that only ran when it felt like it, but Miles loved it. It was his pride and joy. Any weekend he wasn\u2019t with Louise, he was fixing it up; he would spend hours under the body of that thing, coming into the house reeking of oil and exhaust. Mrs. Wilson hated it; she feared for the safety of her nice beige carpet and the cleanliness of his jeans.\n\nIt was freshly spring; it was dry and warm for the first time this year. They were laying on his mother\u2019s old picnic blanket, something she probably wouldn\u2019t care for if she knew. It was pitch black, the only thing that illuminated them were the stars and the faint light of Louise\u2019s kitchen light. They had returned from cruising around town, and neither wanted to go inside yet. They had been lulled into a comfortable silence, their hands knotted together perfectly. And then, suddenly, Louise had a question.\n\n\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d \n\n\u201cLouise\u2026\u201d Miles sighed.\n\nNervousness leaked into her tone, \u201cI was just making sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I don\u2019t hate you? Even though we\u2019re dating?\u201d Miles scoffed, \u201cWhy would I be with you if I hated you? What would I gain from that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if you were using me?\u201d Louise said, her voice small.\n\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Miles sat up and put his head in his hands, \u201c\u2018What if\u2019 Louise, when have I ever, in our entire lives, used you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2014\u201d she started.\n\n\u201cIf you are basing your fear of our relationship on \u2018what ifs,\u2019 maybe we shouldn\u2019t be together. You are so absorbed in your past that it's like you aren\u2019t even seeing me, not now, not in the present,\u201d Miles shot at her.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Louise said, her voice breaking with emotion. \n\nMiles took a deep breath, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for what happened, and I get that healing is a hard and long process. But, Louise, I\u2019m tired, too. \u201d\n\nHot, stinging tears rolled down Louise\u2019s face, wetting the blanket, \u201cI know you love me. Sometimes I\u2019m just scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you scared?\u201d Miles whispered.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she sniffled, \u201cI am what I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are what you are,\u201d Miles repeated, \u201cAnd I\u2019m tired of pretendning I can change that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen stop.\u201d\n\nLouise wiped the tears off her face and climbed out of the truck. Her receding footsteps echoed in Miles' head, a pounding that sounded eerily like his heartbeat\u2014 fast and hard. Miles sat there for a long while. The radio was still on, blasting The Smiths.\n\t\n\nTrumpets blast loud, then louder. You think your eardrum might burst. Then, the music lulls to a stop. The lights do not come on. It is like the entire world has stopped to take a breath. One big inhale. You fill your lungs. The air smells like honeysuckle. \n\nYou are a child running in the yard with your dog. You are barefoot. You step on a bee. You limp into the house and cry to your mother. She puts your foot on ice. \n\nYou will never feel the grass on your bare foot again. You do not need to learn the lesson twice.\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n", "comment_created_utc": 1714350534.0, "reply_text": "Part 2\n\nAugust 15, 1991\n\t\nLouise and Miles hadn\u2019t spoken in months. They were both busy getting ready for college, packing up every item they thought was important\u2014 every memory that would fit in their cars. They lived as perfect strangers, passing each other in the hallway with nothing but polite smiles and avoidant eyes. \n\nAt graduation, they had taken a picture together, hands hovering just above the other\u2019s back, a water smile plastered on their faces. Mrs. Wilson had begged them to. \n\nIt was the night before each of them was leaving for university. The sun had just begun to set when Louise knocked on the Wilson\u2019s door. Miles\u2019 mom answered, a huge smile spread across her face. Mrs. Wilson had ushered her to Miles\u2019 room, telling her that he was out on the roof. \n\nLouise climbed through the small open hatch on his ceiling. Miles was lying on the shingles, eyes closed in relaxation. His t-shirt had ridden up, showing off a small strip of exposed skin. He looked amazing. His hair was longer than she remembered, and the summer sun had tanned his skin. \n\n\u201cHi, Louise,\u201d Miles said, not even looking at her. \n\nLouise crawled towards him and sat down, her knees up at her chest, \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho else would it be?\u201d\n\nLouise sighed, and Miles sat up, mirroring her position. Neither spoke, choosing instead to stare at the pink and orange sky. The clouds swirled together along the treeline, and Louise felt a pang of guilt in her chest\u2014guilt that was rooted so deep she could feel the stinging in her fingertips. She was sorry for everything she had ever done\u2014every breath, every word, every touch of skin. She took a shuddering inhale. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad we knew each other as children,\u201d Louise said, tears threatening to spill down her face; she twisted the silver ring on her finger.\n\nMiles wasn\u2019t looking at her, \u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cCause that means you\u2019re the only person who saw me before.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore what?\u201d he knew the answer. \n\nLouise dropped her head down to her knees, her voice muffled, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miles.\u201d\n\nMiles sighed, finally looking at her, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry, Louise.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am.\u201d\n\nHe reached over to her, pulling her into a hug; his arms were stiff, he said nothing. They sat like that for a long while, the warm summer breeze washing over them. The air smelled like rain. The hard shingles were starting to dig into Louise\u2019s skin. \n\n\u201cI still love you, Miles,\u201d her voice breaks.\n\nMiles swallows thickly, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nTears run down Louise\u2019s face, hot and thick like blood; she can\u2019t breathe, her lungs collapse and expand in irregular rhythms, \u201cWhat if we never see each other again?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will,\u201d Miles promised.\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t lie to me,\u201d she pleaded.\n\n\u201cLouise,\u201d his voice was barely a whisper, \u201cA part of me will always love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t think we should ever see each other again.\u201d\nMiles kissed her on the forehead, unwrapped himself from around her, and climbed back through the hatch. Louise looked down at the ground, picturing her bloodied and broken body splattered on the green lawn. She got up and went through the hatch. \n\nThe lights come back on, the theater once again a murmur of voices. The concert is over.

Jakan and I travel along with one of the heroes of the riven war, Kyrem, who is leading the cavalry archer battalion we are to be his eyes and ears of enemy movement. As we ride our horses, I wondered the source of Jakan happiness.\n\nThis time, it is different, this must have something to do with Jakan and one of the five heroes of riven war, Lankensy. They pressed their upper arms perpendicularly against each other, they chuckled to each other, then separated to get to their duties. I chose to not ask as it isn't important but, doesn't stop my curiosity.\n\nWe have reached our deployment position, I look at Kyrem, he nods to us. Commence reconnaissance, Jakan and I separate from the cavalry archer battalion to scout in peace. It took us a while to actually find undead formations within the area, but, even Jakan let out a coughing sigh from the sight of the numbers we are seeing.\n\n'Winter's roar... If there is even one more formation like that... The cavalry battalions have a tough time... Something I should have expected but, mostly considered unlikely...' Jakan states mildly alarmed by the number of undead in the rectangular formation.\n\n'Fyregeld would need to take part very early... Which is most likely going to be disadvantageous later?' Ask for a confirmation of what I suspect Jakan is thinking.\n\n'Yes... Fyregeld most certainly will be needed in the fight...' Jakan replies still mildly astounded how large the formation is. We move on to continue scouting, but, this is bad news, I guessing both of us are suspecting that this formation's purpose is to alarm the town that they are going to be attacked very soon.\n\nUnfortunately for us, there is a second formation that is just as large as the first one more to the south of south west of the town, while this one is to the south west of it. 'Great, just, bloody fantastic... I will have some choice words for the Valerian scouts, these are probably twice or even thrice the number of undead compared to what they reported...' Jakan says upset about the situation.\n\n'And, these two are part of the three we are supposed to lure into attacking the cavalry... The Valerians are most certainly going to have a bad day...' Reply quietly to try to ease Jakan's mood. It does work...\n\n'Right, let's go look for the third... Hopefully it won't be as big as this and the previous...' Jakan states calmly, remembering that we aren't supposed to take part in the fight against these, but, reports are almost certainly going to be ugly.\n\nThird formation, behind the first formation we scouted is still big but, probably by a third smaller, still a risky fight but, not unwinnable. Jakan told me that best way to beat this one with the forces nearby, would be, that cavalry archers would jog past it while firing arrows into the formation from the rear and front, as the formation is fairly tight and there aren't enough shields.\n\nThe undead casualties would be high, the cavalry archers would only stay as long as to bait the enemy to charge them, which leaves them open to be charged by the Valerian cavalry battalion, under the command of Tyrelia, one of the heroes of riven war. It's going to be a nasty melee but, one that would be the most effective on completely destroying this formation.\n\nFollow up maneuvers would be that the cavalry archers, once they are being pursued, will regroup to attack the large south western formation, while once the cavalry battalion has routed or utterly destroyed this small formation will attack the rear of the southern undead formation, to goad them to pursue them.\n\nOnce the cavalry archer battalion has begun the fall back, the cavalry battalion will follow. From there, it is following the plan. The plan discussed yesterday still can be done but, it is going to be a lot more uglier in terms of results than expected. We scouted little bit longer to make sure there aren't other formations nearby.\n\nThere is fourth, which we suspect to be a reserve formation for the assault, it is about as big as the third. There is a mistake with it's location however, that is good news for the cavalry archer battalion. They are too far away to assist the large south western formation. Jakan sighed from mild relief. 'Well, at least some kind of good news... Although, once the pursuit is initiated, they most likely will join the battle.' Jakan says to me.\n\n'I agree, thankfully we aren't supposed to give battle assistance in these fights... We would both be sore from the exhaustion later today, or worse, grievously wounded.' Reply to Jakan, he nodded in agreement. Jakan then motioned to me with his head that, this is enough, time to report to battalions. Nodding in agreement we head back.We arrive as Kyrem and Tyrelia are talking with the squadron commanders. 'What are your reports?' Kyrem hails us as we approach.\n\n'Relatively far away from the best news, unfortunately but, there is some good too.' Jakan states calmly knowing that what we have seen, is going bring up mixed feelings. Jakan debriefs all on scene, on what we have discovered.\n\nKyrem displayed some worry but, when we told about the secondary reserve formation's positional mistake. He began to think about the situation more intensily. Tyrelia also looked worried, she and the battalion under her command, have a work cut out for them...\n\nAll squadron commanders deemed the plan still doable but, they all agreed on the fact that, this is going to be a seriously tough skirmish. Now, they need to be quick, Tyrelia gave Jakan a flag pole and a flag for the second part of this operation. 'Anything you would like to say before we begin?' One of the cavalry squadron commanders ask from us.\n\n'For life, for the people, for Valerie.' Jakan states in hardened tone, we must begin and see our parts done in this operation.\n\n'For life, for the people, for Valerie. I agree.' Tyrelia say with high spirit.\n\n'Time to do our duty, all of you ready?' Kyrem asks from all of us.'Yes, sir.' Jakan and I reply without hesitation nor fear. We departed to head towards the north west of the castle. Behind us, pace of the hooves of more than hundred horses began to jog. We will not see them for a while now.\n\nAs soon as we arrived to the area we should scout out for any possible formations that might try to take positions north west or west of the castle where the supposed surprise pitched battle is to happen. We begin scouting, for a while, all the way to the past mid day, we do not find any undead formations, they must have combined formations for the assault on the town.\n\nUnfortunately for them, it was done way too early... And now, there is a massive gap in the area control, gap which armed forces of Valerie are now beginning to exploit. We don't know whether the cavalry battalions have made good on their promises at the moment but, unfortunately for the infantry battalions the gap is going to be closed soon.\n\nAnd there will be a battle that is a hard one for the one Lankensy is leading. These undead formations we are seeing, two of them, are about same size and number as the reserve formations to the south and south west of the town. We will need to improvise, one of those reserve size formations would have been bad enough. As we were heading back.\n\nWe see smoke, quite thick and seems to be from the direction where Fyregeld was to be signaled to ignite a forest, which undead infantry would use to try catch up with the formation moving cavalry. Unfortunately for us, we do not know how much damage this has caused and, we, Lankensy and his infantry battalion have a big endeavor ahead of us.\n\nJakan is still staring at the formations, probably staring at the distance between them. 'We can take them.' Jakan states calmly, which baffled me so much so that I let out an audible what. 'We can take them, We will be outnumbered three to one but, I have a plan.' Jakan adds and shakes his two handed sword slightly.\n\n'I don't think it is enough.' Reply to Jakan in unsure tone as, such numerical advantage is enough for every attacking force to destroy a defending force.\n\n'We will improvise, I will tell you once we reach sir Lanksensy.' Jakan states confidently.\n\n'Okay...' I say slightly shakily, unsure whether it is warrior heart of Jakan making him act stupidly, or soldier's mind that whatever is the adversity, we handle it together... We head to where we agreed to meet Lanksensy and the infantry battalion he is leading in this battle.\n\nJakan prepared the flag and the flag pole, attaches the flag on the pole, then began to wave it, as the undead formations came into an open ground. Both of soon heard roar from the sky, we looked to the direction and see Fyregeld diving to harass the rear of the second formation of undead behind us.\n\nWe continue riding our steeds to the rally point. We reach it in good time, Lankensy was waiting for us with Seirialia. 'Bad news, we will receive undead formation that outnumbers us three to one.' Jakan states immediately before dismounting, I follow him.Lankensy at first seemed quite eager to fight but, such odds sobered his expression. 'We can take them, Fyregeld is already harrassing the formation behind the first one from the rear, so there will be chaos which buys us time.' Jakan says, Lankensy frowns while Seirialia looked grim.\n\n'Tell me you have a plan.' Lankensy says, sounding surprisingly content and a smirk appeared on his lips.\n\n'Yes sir. I will use the runes on my blade to create walls to hide the true number of our forces and act as a small choke point for the infantry to hold, you divide your battalion to three detachments. The center will hold the choke point with all they have, while southern and northern detachments make sure we won't get flanked around the stone walls.\n\nWhen they begin their attempt to flank, the south and north detachments will begin fighting advance to box in our opponents. Seirialia, your arcane mastery is required, take a high ground and, rain hell on the enemy masses that engage the infantry detachments.' Jakan explains the plan.\n\nJakan draws his plan on to the dirt with his mace as he speaks. The terrain we are at, most certainly favors us... From that high ground, to the north east, is a perfect place to begin. Lankensy motions the infantry commanders to approach. He briefs them on the plan Jakan has proposed.\n\n'Jakan, this is going to get ugly, but, with this plan... The glory will be quite gorgeous.' Lankensy states as the infantry commanders nod that they will follow this plan.\n\n'This will be an ugly battle but, we will win it. Volarie, I need you to provide me more arcane, if the battle does get bad, with your assistance I will break the ground beneath our foes, so they have to fight from a disadvantageous position.' Jakan says without a hint of worry in his voice.\n\n'Would it be better that I would provide you the assistance Jakan?' Seirialia asks alarmed by proposal from Jakan to me.\n\n'No, we need your skill in magic to disrupt undead and to make sure that they have will have difficult time on concentrating their forces to put pressure on any of the three infantry detachments. Volarie already knows how to do it, and we have done this couple times before.' Jakan replies in calm tone.\n\nI do remember, they were small in scale but, with right amount of concentration, we can do even bigger one. I am still worried though... Seirialia has the better mastery of arcane, I do not have as much skill or energy as her and Jakan's own capacity for arcane is rather limited. The plan is good though...\n\n'Alright, I am ready.' Say finally without hesitation, although, I have some in my heart...\n\n'I will hold the center, Volarie, move with the northern detachment to the position, Jakan you do the same, but with the south. Seirialia, I think you should get into position.' Lankensy says calmly.\n\n'Yes sir.' Jakan and I say.\n\n'Alright, I will trust your judgment.' Seirialia says to Jakan.\n\n'Lady, I will get it done.' Jakan states with serious tone and ready to do everything in his power to win this battle. She nods to Jakan trusting him and I to do our part.\n\nJakan used the runes on his blade to create the walls, while I went into the position. We began to wait, waiting, the most nerve wrecking part of his plan... Soon, undead were sighted and they immediately rush to engage the choke point, slightly dispersing to begin also go around the stone walls. North infantry detachment began to jog to close the flanks, I go with them.\n\nThe plan is so far working, undead began engaging all three points without concentrating to break out through one. Now, we wait again, I listen to the battle raging before me, every now and then look around to see if we are getting flanked. Then I saw big chunks of ice raining into the center of the open left side box, infantry have formed. Second reserve force has now entered the battle.\n\nThey also charged right in, this is the moment where Jakan and I, head to the rear of the undead, and break the ground they stand in. As we had practiced, I place my hand on Jakan's left shoulder and begin channeling my arcane energy into him, just as he began to grasp the earth with his hands and began casting an earth rupture spell.\n\nI allowed Jakan to take the lead and just follow him. Spell is complete, and Jakan made a two handed fist, then brought it down onto the dirt in front of him. Like water that got hit by massive weight on it's surface earth ruptured upwards at the center of the box, flinging countless amount of undead into the air.\n\nSoil and stone rained upon the mass of undead, causing further losses of undead infantry. We gaze upon what we caused, both of us spent in terms of arcane. 'It is not enough, the battle still favors them...' Jakan says angrily and looks like he wants to charge in.\n\n'That is a suicide.' Say to him in serious tone. Jakan calms down and thinks.\n\n'Now, we just have to fight hard... Fight your way through to the northern detachment, while I fight to the south. Kills as many as you can cause as much as chaos as possible, when you reach allies, tell them to begin pushing forward with all their might. Because this is it, either they or us, break first.' Jakan says clearly frustrated that it has come to this but, no other options.\n\nWe collide our swords and wish fortune to each other, we separated and begin skirmishing. After fighting a while, I reach Valerian infantry northern detachment. 'Push! Push! It is either us or them!' Shout as loud as possible. Their commander heard me, a moment of consideration flashes in his expression, it soon hardens into seriousness.\n\n'Fight, fight, fight with all your might!' He roars and joins the battle. Northern detachment slowly, orderly, but, surely, began taking ground from the undead. I join the commander, who would have distrusted me but, here, in this moment, we are not enemies.\n\nSoon, to the last skeleton, walking dead and fallen's end. The undead were slain, soldiers began collapsing from exhaustion. I hear horses running towards us, turning to look, it is Tyrelia's cavalry battalion, then I look opposite of me, spot Jakan on his knees and relying on his sword, looks more like he is just trying to catch his breath and relax. To my left, I see Lankensy at the center detachment, he also looks quite exhausted\n\n.'Hail hero of the riven war... It is done...' Say with stamina that I still have as Tyrelia approaches us on her steed.\n\n'By the light... How many have you slain?' Tyrelia says as she looks at the ground before the resting soldiers of northern detachment. I think a while...\n\n'Twenty three...' Say still exhausted and look around, Seirialia has reached Lankensy, they embrace each other. Ground quaked a little as Fyregeld landed, he is completely fine, but, his expression tells of bewilderment.\n\n'Fyregeld, we will need to screen for more undead that might head towards here. They need rest not another battle.' Tyrelia states looking at all of the Valerian soldiers who have taken part in this battle.\n\n'I agree wholeheartedly lady Tyrelia. I would like to hear what happened here to have caused a battle of this scale.' Fyregeld says, still quite baffled by the amount of undead that has been slain.\n\nAfter resting almost to the beginning of dusk. We begin moving back into the castle from the northern entrance. I join Jakan's company who is now feeling a lot better, still exhausted but, at least enough rested that we begin walking our steeds back into the castle. Seeing it better to not ruin the current atmosphere of victorious but, exhausted Valerian soldiers.\n\nI have the intention on breaking the silence between Jakan and I but, then I heard somebody approaching us on a horse and some jogging. We turn to look, and they are Tyrelia, Lankensy and Seirialia. As Lankensy opened his mouth to say something, ground quaked a little and we were joined by Fyregeld.\n\n'What are the reports of commanders Gonzil, Salgi and Tynzio?' Lankensy asks from Tyrelia.\n\n'Only three out of twenty have suffered wounds, by the looks of your battalion, I estimate yours had it worse than them combined.' Tyrelia says in praising tone.\n\n'We ended up having to fight two reserve formations of undead... Thanks to Jakan's plan... It probably would have ended up a whole lot worse.' Lankensy states in humble tone.\n\n'Negative sir...' Jakan sighs out, unwilling to receive praise, not out of that it offends him. 'Real heroes of this battle are the soldiers marching behind us.' Jakan adds mildly worried he might have offended.\n\n'True but, you do deserve some praise draconian... Thanks to your quick thinking, that probably would have turned out to be a victory as bad as defeat.' Lankensy says, mildly amused by Jakan behavior and smiles warmly.\n\n'I would have charged into the center of the undead, if Volarie wouldn't have calmed me down...' Jakan replies keeping composure but, wanting to avoid praise. Curse you Jakan... Don't shove into the spot of light in a cave...\n\n'I only told him, what I believed was on his mind, is a suicide.' Say the truth of the matter.\n\n'Could you both, just stop avoiding our gratitude?' Tyrelia asks teasing us, probably figured out, why we are behaving in this manner.\n\n'With all respect, lady Tyrelia... We are just trying to avoid taking too much praise. We fear that the soldiers wouldn't take it idly.' Jakan replies steadily.\n\n'While I do understand reasoning, you shouldn't downplay your part in this, I believe the commanders would also make it clear to their men, that this was achieved with effort from everybody.' Fyregeld reasons, Jakan just exhales in begrudging manner, probably because what Fyregeld said, is true.\n\nEven I can not find a way to weasel a way out from receiving gratitude from Valerians... 'Alright then...' Jakan replies in slightly defeated tone, declaring his intention to cease avoiding receiving gratitude.\n\n'You are correct lord Fyregeld.' State in slightly defeated tone. Our intention is to maintain as high as possible morale among the Valerian soldiers, we can handle the influence of dark arcane in the air without issues, it is the effect on the soldiers we are most concerned about.\n\n'How bad did it look? Lady Seirialia.' Jakan asks, it makes sense why he asked that. He only had the battle level awareness, while Seirialia had better awareness of the battle situation from the high ground.\n\n'It looked quite bad, after your earth rupture, the battle still was in the favor of the undead, from my position, I could only do so little when I had cast spells that I could.' Seirialia replies smiles warmly, Jaka scoffs in tone telling of his discomfort, knowing that he was correct in his battle assessment in that moment.\n\n'Can you explain the chain of events?' Fyregeld asks from me and Jakan. Jakan looked at me, asking that should we be truthful, I look at him in a manner saying yes. Jakan closes his eyes slowly and rolls his eyes. He explains what transpired in more detail. Tyrelia and Fyregeld listen carefully.\n\nI am more eager to hear their angle on what happened...", "index": "red11_s14_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red11_s14_c0_", "comment_text": "It is the day, where military force of Valerie here, finally goes into offensive.

I will use the runes on my blade to create walls to hide the true number of our forces and act as a small choke point for the infantry to hold, you divide your battalion to three detachments. The center will hold the choke point with all they have, while southern and northern detachments make sure we won't get flanked around the stone walls.\n\nWhen they begin their attempt to flank, the south and north detachments will begin fighting advance to box in our opponents. Seirialia, your arcane mastery is required, take a high ground and, rain hell on the enemy masses that engage the infantry detachments.' Jakan explains the plan.\n\nJakan draws his plan on to the dirt with his mace as he speaks. The terrain we are at, most certainly favors us... From that high ground, to the north east, is a perfect place to begin. Lankensy motions the infantry commanders to approach. He briefs them on the plan Jakan has proposed.\n\n'Jakan, this is going to get ugly, but, with this plan... The glory will be quite gorgeous.' Lankensy states as the infantry commanders nod that they will follow this plan.\n\n'This will be an ugly battle but, we will win it. Volarie, I need you to provide me more arcane, if the battle does get bad, with your assistance I will break the ground beneath our foes, so they have to fight from a disadvantageous position.' Jakan says without a hint of worry in his voice.\n\n'Would it be better that I would provide you the assistance Jakan?' Seirialia asks alarmed by proposal from Jakan to me.\n\n'No, we need your skill in magic to disrupt undead and to make sure that they have will have difficult time on concentrating their forces to put pressure on any of the three infantry detachments. Volarie already knows how to do it, and we have done this couple times before.' Jakan replies in calm tone.\n\nI do remember, they were small in scale but, with right amount of concentration, we can do even bigger one. I am still worried though... Seirialia has the better mastery of arcane, I do not have as much skill or energy as her and Jakan's own capacity for arcane is rather limited. The plan is good though...\n\n'Alright, I am ready.' Say finally without hesitation, although, I have some in my heart...\n\n'I will hold the center, Volarie, move with the northern detachment to the position, Jakan you do the same, but with the south. Seirialia, I think you should get into position.' Lankensy says calmly.\n\n'Yes sir.' Jakan and I say.\n\n'Alright, I will trust your judgment.' Seirialia says to Jakan.\n\n'Lady, I will get it done.' Jakan states with serious tone and ready to do everything in his power to win this battle. She nods to Jakan trusting him and I to do our part.\n\nJakan used the runes on his blade to create the walls, while I went into the position. We began to wait, waiting, the most nerve wrecking part of his plan... Soon, undead were sighted and they immediately rush to engage the choke point, slightly dispersing to begin also go around the stone walls. North infantry detachment began to jog to close the flanks, I go with them.\n\nThe plan is so far working, undead began engaging all three points without concentrating to break out through one. Now, we wait again, I listen to the battle raging before me, every now and then look around to see if we are getting flanked. Then I saw big chunks of ice raining into the center of the open left side box, infantry have formed. Second reserve force has now entered the battle.\n\nThey also charged right in, this is the moment where Jakan and I, head to the rear of the undead, and break the ground they stand in. As we had practiced, I place my hand on Jakan's left shoulder and begin channeling my arcane energy into him, just as he began to grasp the earth with his hands and began casting an earth rupture spell.\n\nI allowed Jakan to take the lead and just follow him. Spell is complete, and Jakan made a two handed fist, then brought it down onto the dirt in front of him. Like water that got hit by massive weight on it's surface earth ruptured upwards at the center of the box, flinging countless amount of undead into the air.\n\nSoil and stone rained upon the mass of undead, causing further losses of undead infantry. We gaze upon what we caused, both of us spent in terms of arcane. 'It is not enough, the battle still favors them...' Jakan says angrily and looks like he wants to charge in.\n\n'That is a suicide.' Say to him in serious tone. Jakan calms down and thinks.\n\n'Now, we just have to fight hard... Fight your way through to the northern detachment, while I fight to the south. Kills as many as you can cause as much as chaos as possible, when you reach allies, tell them to begin pushing forward with all their might. Because this is it, either they or us, break first.' Jakan says clearly frustrated that it has come to this but, no other options.\n\nWe collide our swords and wish fortune to each other, we separated and begin skirmishing. After fighting a while, I reach Valerian infantry northern detachment. 'Push! Push! It is either us or them!' Shout as loud as possible. Their commander heard me, a moment of consideration flashes in his expression, it soon hardens into seriousness.\n\n'Fight, fight, fight with all your might!' He roars and joins the battle. Northern detachment slowly, orderly, but, surely, began taking ground from the undead. I join the commander, who would have distrusted me but, here, in this moment, we are not enemies.\n\nSoon, to the last skeleton, walking dead and fallen's end. The undead were slain, soldiers began collapsing from exhaustion. I hear horses running towards us, turning to look, it is Tyrelia's cavalry battalion, then I look opposite of me, spot Jakan on his knees and relying on his sword, looks more like he is just trying to catch his breath and relax. To my left, I see Lankensy at the center detachment, he also looks quite exhausted\n\n.'Hail hero of the riven war... It is done...' Say with stamina that I still have as Tyrelia approaches us on her steed.\n\n'By the light... How many have you slain?' Tyrelia says as she looks at the ground before the resting soldiers of northern detachment. I think a while...\n\n'Twenty three...' Say still exhausted and look around, Seirialia has reached Lankensy, they embrace each other. Ground quaked a little as Fyregeld landed, he is completely fine, but, his expression tells of bewilderment.\n\n'Fyregeld, we will need to screen for more undead that might head towards here. They need rest not another battle.' Tyrelia states looking at all of the Valerian soldiers who have taken part in this battle.\n\n'I agree wholeheartedly lady Tyrelia. I would like to hear what happened here to have caused a battle of this scale.' Fyregeld says, still quite baffled by the amount of undead that has been slain.\n\nAfter resting almost to the beginning of dusk. We begin moving back into the castle from the northern entrance. I join Jakan's company who is now feeling a lot better, still exhausted but, at least enough rested that we begin walking our steeds back into the castle. Seeing it better to not ruin the current atmosphere of victorious but, exhausted Valerian soldiers.\n\nI have the intention on breaking the silence between Jakan and I but, then I heard somebody approaching us on a horse and some jogging. We turn to look, and they are Tyrelia, Lankensy and Seirialia. As Lankensy opened his mouth to say something, ground quaked a little and we were joined by Fyregeld.\n\n'What are the reports of commanders Gonzil, Salgi and Tynzio?' Lankensy asks from Tyrelia.\n\n'Only three out of twenty have suffered wounds, by the looks of your battalion, I estimate yours had it worse than them combined.' Tyrelia says in praising tone.\n\n'We ended up having to fight two reserve formations of undead... Thanks to Jakan's plan... It probably would have ended up a whole lot worse.' Lankensy states in humble tone.\n\n'Negative sir...' Jakan sighs out, unwilling to receive praise, not out of that it offends him. 'Real heroes of this battle are the soldiers marching behind us.' Jakan adds mildly worried he might have offended.\n\n'True but, you do deserve some praise draconian... Thanks to your quick thinking, that probably would have turned out to be a victory as bad as defeat.' Lankensy says, mildly amused by Jakan behavior and smiles warmly.\n\n'I would have charged into the center of the undead, if Volarie wouldn't have calmed me down...' Jakan replies keeping composure but, wanting to avoid praise. Curse you Jakan... Don't shove into the spot of light in a cave...\n\n'I only told him, what I believed was on his mind, is a suicide.' Say the truth of the matter.\n\n'Could you both, just stop avoiding our gratitude?' Tyrelia asks teasing us, probably figured out, why we are behaving in this manner.\n\n'With all respect, lady Tyrelia... We are just trying to avoid taking too much praise. We fear that the soldiers wouldn't take it idly.' Jakan replies steadily.\n\n'While I do understand reasoning, you shouldn't downplay your part in this, I believe the commanders would also make it clear to their men, that this was achieved with effort from everybody.' Fyregeld reasons, Jakan just exhales in begrudging manner, probably because what Fyregeld said, is true.\n\nEven I can not find a way to weasel a way out from receiving gratitude from Valerians... 'Alright then...' Jakan replies in slightly defeated tone, declaring his intention to cease avoiding receiving gratitude.\n\n'You are correct lord Fyregeld.' State in slightly defeated tone. Our intention is to maintain as high as possible morale among the Valerian soldiers, we can handle the influence of dark arcane in the air without issues, it is the effect on the soldiers we are most concerned about.\n\n'How bad did it look? Lady Seirialia.' Jakan asks, it makes sense why he asked that. He only had the battle level awareness, while Seirialia had better awareness of the battle situation from the high ground.\n\n'It looked quite bad, after your earth rupture, the battle still was in the favor of the undead, from my position, I could only do so little when I had cast spells that I could.' Seirialia replies smiles warmly, Jaka scoffs in tone telling of his discomfort, knowing that he was correct in his battle assessment in that moment.\n\n'Can you explain the chain of events?' Fyregeld asks from me and Jakan. Jakan looked at me, asking that should we be truthful, I look at him in a manner saying yes. Jakan closes his eyes slowly and rolls his eyes. He explains what transpired in more detail. Tyrelia and Fyregeld listen carefully.\n\nI am more eager to hear their angle on what happened...", "comment_created_utc": 1714344803.0, "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

No matter how she tried to spin it, they wouldn\u2019t accept that Joe not being in the Poiloogs' system could be a good thing. In their mind, there had been only two explanations for him failing to make contact at any of their pre-arranged meetings. Either he had been captured, or he was dead. If the guards here had no record of him, that left only one option.\n\nMadeline couldn\u2019t blame them really. She\u2019d always been one to leap to the worst possible conclusion. That way, either the world met your expectations and proved you right, or you got a pleasant surprise. And of course, she had to accept that Billie knew their brother, and she didn\u2019t. Anything she had to offer was based on wild speculation and baseless optimism, and therefore was of little help. Still, she wished that she could do something to make them feel just a little better.\n\nSo she did what she could. She took on the responsibility of keeping watch and communicating with their allies outside throughout the night, hardly getting any sleep. But from the sniffling coming from the bunk above her, she suspected Billie wasn\u2019t getting much either. She seized every opportunity to offer a kind word, or a gentle touch or hug or kiss \u2014 anything to make sure they knew that they were loved. But really, all she could do was watch and wait.\n\nThe news had shaken her too. Though she\u2019d been pessimistic at first, she\u2019d almost managed to convince herself that finding Liam and Joe in here was a sure thing, simply a matter of working hard and waiting. If it had failed for one of them, who was to say it wouldn\u2019t fail for the other too? After all, there had been Poiloog and human blood in that caf\u00e9 where they\u2019d found Liam\u2019s things.\n\nIt helped knowing that Marcus was already looking in the system for Liam, so while the wait to hear back was torture, at least she knew it was temporary. She would have her answer soon enough. \n\nIn the meantime, she threw herself into her work, trying to lose herself in the mindless repetition of the potato harvest to avoid thinking about all the unpleasant possibilities of what might come next. And she was fairly successful. Still learning the ropes, her mind was occupied picking up the most efficient ways to bring in the harvest and her body was exhausted enough that outside of work, she had little energy left for anything but eating and sleeping. \n\nThe days blurred together, passing surprisingly quickly. She soon found that she could roll out of bed and stumble to the potato fields, carry out a solid day's work, and stumble back to dinner and the bed without really engaging with the world at all, lost in her routine as she was.\n\nUntil the routine was interrupted by a commotion in the dormitory one morning.\n\nAs the lights came on, blaring bright white light to wake them, the door swung open as usual. But it wasn\u2019t just Marcus there this morning. There was another guard with him. They were standing either side of a woman Madeline vaguely recognised \u2014 Sarah! Joanna and Ben\u2019s sister!\n\nThey came into the room, practically carrying Sarah between them, and paused just inside the doorway.\n\n\u201cListen up everyone!\u201d the guard shouted, the one Madeline didn\u2019t recognise.\n\nThere were a few groans as people sat up or climbed out of bed, glancing over in the direction of the disturbance. Madeline stood, craning to get a better look. The woman looked tired \u2014 more exhausted than Madeline felt, or perhaps had ever felt. Her eyes were gaunt and her face haggard, adorned by numerous scrapes and cuts and bruises.\n\n\u201cPlease welcome back Sarah into your midst,\u201d the guard continued. \u201cAnd please, anyone who might consider breaking the rules, ask her how her past couple of months have been.\u201d He shoved her forward, causing her to stumble. It was only Marcus\u2019s arm still in hers that stopped her from hitting the floor. \n\nHe gently nudged her towards her former bunk before turning to the rest of the room. \u201cAlright, everyone. The show\u2019s over. Time to get ready for work. I\u2019ll be back for you all soon.\u201d\n\nAs the guards' footsteps faded down the corridor, a heavy silence sunk over the room, all eyes on the poor young woman now curled up on her bunk with Joanna and Ben comforting her.\n\nPart of Madeline longed to go over and see what had happened, but she knew that now wasn\u2019t the time. Besides, she wasn\u2019t sure she really wanted to know. She and Billie broke the rules every night when they contacted Lena, passing on important details about the operations of the base. If anyone found their walkies, at least one of them would meet the same fate as Sarah \u2014 or worse. Perhaps it would be easier to continue if she didn\u2019t know exactly what that fate might be. Especially given it seemed it might be temporary. Surely she could endure anything if it was temporary. And there was no use worrying about something that might never happen.\n\nShe shook her head. Not that she\u2019d ever let that stop her. She was practically the queen of worrying about things that might never happen.\n\nEveryone was abuzz at work and dinner that day, with rumours flying about where Sarah had been. Some said she\u2019d been given the worst of the worst jobs, but no one could agree on what that was. Others said she\u2019d been thrown in some kind of oubliette all this time. Others reckoned that there was a torture chamber underneath one of the factories where the machines masked the sounds of the screams. \n\nMadeline tried not to think about it, instead focusing on Billie when she wasn\u2019t focussing on her work. They were starting to seem a little more themself, perhaps helped along by the distraction. And Madeline had an idea of what she could do with their free day to help them along even further. She just needed a little help to make it happen.\n\nThe next morning when Marcus came to deliver breakfast and send them off to work, Madeline sidled up to him. \u201cHey there. Is it okay if I ask a quick question before we go?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m always happy to help where I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just wondering exactly how much freedom we had on our free days. Up until now I\u2019ve been pretty tired so I\u2019ve been happy to spend it inside reading or listening to music, but\u2026\u201d She glanced over at Billie, languishing on their bunk. \u201cWell, I wanted to see about doing something different to try and cheer my friend up after the news they got about their brother.\u201d\n\nMarcus nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet of you! What did you have in mind?\u201d\n\n\u201cA little cathartic exercise. All I\u2019d need is somewhere with plenty of space \u2014 inside or outside \u2014 ideally with some pillars or sturdy structures.  And lots and lots of cushions or soft things if that\u2019s at all possible.\u201d\n\nThe young guard gave her a strange look, but he was still smiling. \u201cOkay. I think that can be arranged.\u201d\n\nExcitement fluttered in Madeline\u2019s chest. \u201cThanks so much!\u201d She clapped her hands together in front of her, grinning over them. \u201cI\u2019ll let you get back to it now. But seriously, thank you!\u201d She turned to hurry away, a spring entering her step for the first time in weeks.\n\nThe rest of the week dragged slightly, time slowed by anticipation, but their free day finally arrived. When it did, Marcus was there at their bunks first thing to meet them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Billie asked, rubbing the sleep from their eyes. \u201cIs there news about Liam?\u201d\n\nThe young guard grimaced. \u201cNot yet, I\u2019m afraid. And as for what\u2019s going on\u2026\u201d He looked down at where Madeline was sitting on the lower bunk and grinned. \u201cI\u2019ll leave that to your friend to explain. Now, come on you two. I brought some breakfast for you to eat on the way.\u201d\n\nThe pair of them followed Marcus out as they ate, Billie quizzing Madeline between mouthfuls. But no matter how many times they asked, Madeline refused to answer any questions until they got there.\n\nMarcus led them outside, weaving between the buildings until they reached a large wooden barn. Inside, wooden beams and pillars dotted the space, supporting the roof and walls, and pillows and cushions littered the floor.\n\nBillie glanced between Madeline and Marcus. \u201cReally?\u201d they asked, arching an eyebrow. \n\nMadeline grinned. \u201cReally.\u201d\n\nMarcus shrugged. \u201cI have no idea. I just did what was asked of me. Now,\u201d he nodded at them both, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two to it.\u201d He started to leave, pausing at the door to wave. \u201cI\u2019ll be back around lunchtime to check in on you.\u201d\n\nTurning back to Billie, Madeline opened her arms to gesture vaguely to the whole space. \u201cSo, what do you think? Ready for some catharsis with cushions and violence?\u201d\n\nBillie threw their arms around her and squeezed, knocking the air out of her slightly with the ferocity of their embrace. \u201cI love you, Mads.\u201d\n\n---\n\n***Author's Note:*** *Next chapter due on 5th May*", "index": "red11_s15_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red11_s15_c0_", "comment_text": "[Link to serial master post for other chapters](https://www.reddit.com/r/RainbowWrites/s/JxGKlyy8jF)\n\n\nTry as she might, Madeline could do little to lift Billie\u2019s mood over the days following the news \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 of their brother.

Inside, wooden beams and pillars dotted the space, supporting the roof and walls, and pillows and cushions littered the floor.\n\nBillie glanced between Madeline and Marcus. \u201cReally?\u201d they asked, arching an eyebrow. \n\nMadeline grinned. \u201cReally.\u201d\n\nMarcus shrugged. \u201cI have no idea. I just did what was asked of me. Now,\u201d he nodded at them both, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you two to it.\u201d He started to leave, pausing at the door to wave. \u201cI\u2019ll be back around lunchtime to check in on you.\u201d\n\nTurning back to Billie, Madeline opened her arms to gesture vaguely to the whole space. \u201cSo, what do you think? Ready for some catharsis with cushions and violence?\u201d\n\nBillie threw their arms around her and squeezed, knocking the air out of her slightly with the ferocity of their embrace. \u201cI love you, Mads.\u201d\n\n---\n\n***Author's Note:*** *Next chapter due on 5th May*", "comment_created_utc": 1714308713.0, "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

They were red and crusty.\n\n\u201cSo, you just attacked this guy for no reason, huh?\u201d  Officer Bailey asked.\n\nIf there was a reason, Mike had no clue what it could be.  He didn\u2019t remember attacking anyone.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t make sense Mike,\u201d Bailey continued.  \u201cFrom what everyone says, the kid was minding his own business, polite, totally unaware of what was about to happen to him.\u201d\n\nBailey reached down and opened up a yellow folder.  He pulled out several photographs and laid them on the table.\n\nBlood.  A lotta blood.  And underneath was the mashed up face of a man.  Red and pulpy.  Mike could see a single blue eye staring up at him.  It looked frightened.\n\n\u201cIs he\u2026\u201d Mike started to ask, then hesitated before the last word.\n\n\u201cDead?\u201d  Officer Bailey answered, finishing Mike\u2019s sentence for him.  \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\n\nMike didn\u2019t know what to think.  He only remembered hearing the name, \u201cKyle Anderson.\u201d  After that, everything was blank.\n\n\u201cMurder, Mike, that\u2019s what this is.\u201d  Bailey said, poking a finger at the pictures.  \u201cYou beat Kyle to death, crushed his windpipe with your bare hands.  What I can\u2019t figure out is why.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a goddamn animal,\u201d said the cop standing in the corner of the interrogation room.  Thompson was his name.  Tall, lean, well-dressed, sipping coffee from a styrofoam cup.\n\n\u201cMaybe Kyle did something to set you off?\u201d  Bailey cut back in.  \u201cYou know, figured you\u2019d teach the kid a lesson, but you didn\u2019t realize your own strength.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you a tough guy, Mike?\u201d  Thompson added, his voice tinged with contempt.\n\nMike certainly didn\u2019t see himself that way.  Sure, he\u2019d been in a couple of fights in high school.  \u201cSlapping contests,\u201d would be a more accurate description of those.  Mike was fit, a little rough around the edges, but far from a tough guy.  Never in a million years could he envision himself assaulting a random stranger while waiting in line at the cellphone store.\n\nAnd yet, there were witnesses.  Lots of them, and they all pointed the finger at Mike.\n\nA faint buzzing noise came from Thompson's direction.  He reached into his pocket and pulled out a phone.  Thompon\u2019s angular face lit up as he touched the screen.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got quite a case against you.\u201d  Bailey said, drawing Mike\u2019s attention back to him.  \u201cAll we want to know now is why you did it?  Why on Earth did you attack Mr. Anderson?\u201d\n\nWhat could he say?  Mike had no answer.  Even if he did, he never got the chance to offer one.\n\nThompson stuffed his phone back into his pocket, walked over to the door, turned and said, \u201cBailey.\u201d\n\nIn an instant everything flashed white.  Mike felt himself suddenly lurch forward.\n\nThe interview room was gone.  So were the cops.  Mike was floating through a cloudy void, swirling with every color in the rainbow.  It was beautiful and sickening at the same time.  Intense pressure bore down on Mike\u2019s body as he rocketed through the endless expanse.\n\nA chorus of indistinct whispers rose up around him, talking over each other all at once.  Occasionally Mike thought he could make out a word here and there.  \u201cGo,\u201d he heard once.  \u201cUnder,\u201d another voice said.  Other words, including, \u201csevered, blood, reunited,\u201d and, \u201ccomplete,\u201d hissed in his head.  The rest was gibberish.\n\nBefore Mike could make sense of what was happening, the clouds in front of him parted, opening up to reveal a gaping red chasm.  It was immense, stretching from one end of the horizon to the other.\n\nThe whispers exploded into a cacophony of static.  It was as though someone had cranked the volume knob in Mike\u2019s head all the way to maximum.  Pain shot through his eardrums, cascading violently into his temples.  His vision blurred.\n\nThen the voices stopped.  The pain subsided.  Mike was able to make out something moving beyond the opening.  It was dark and immense, studded with bony protrusions the size of skyscrapers.\n\n\u201cA hand,\u201d Mike realized.  He was looking at an enormous black hand with six fingers, curled inward to form a fist.\n\nSlowly they started to unfurl, revealing a titanic fanged mouth in the palm of the hand.  A wave of intense heat poured out of it, washing over Mike\u2019s body.  His flesh boiled.  Blisters bubbled up on every inch of Mike\u2019s exposed skin.  He screamed and writhed, all while plummeting into the depths of that horrific maw.\n\nA flash of white filled Mike\u2019s vision.  Pain tore through his stomach, followed by something stinging his shoulder.  He was running.  Mike knew this because he could feel his feet violently thrust into the pavement.  That\u2019s when he realized he was outside, on the street.\n\nA loud, \u201ccrack,\u201d cut through the air.  Something whizzed past Mike\u2019s head.  It sparked as it collided with a nearby brick wall.\n\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Mike shouted.  Someone was shooting at him.\n\nHe turned to look over his shoulder.  There was Thompson, gun drawn.  Mike ducked into a nearby alley just as he heard another loud bang fill the air.\n\nThoughts raced through Mike\u2019s mind.  Where was he?  What was he doing?  How did he escape from the police station?  And why was he in so much pain?\n\nOnly then did it dawn on Mike that he had been shot, twice, once in the stomach and once in the shoulder.\n\nA brick facade rose up in front of Mike, hemmed in on either side by two buildings.  It was a dead end, Mike realized.  He was trapped.\n\n\u201cNowhere left to run, tough guy,\u201d Mike heard Thompson say.\n\nHe turned to see the barrel of a gun pointed right at him.  A cruel smile stretched across Thompson\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cI saw it the moment they brought you into the station,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe others couldn\u2019t see it, of course.  Poor old Bailey didn\u2019t see it.  But I did.\u201d\n\nMike had no idea what Thompson was talking about.\n\n\u201cListen,\u201d Mike stammered, \u201cI don't know what's going on.  I don\u2019t know where I am, or how I\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBang!\u201d  Mike felt something tear into his abdomen, causing a spasm of pain to ripple throughout his body.  He looked down to see a trickle of red ooze out of his stomach.\n\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Mike thought.  \u201cHe shot me!\u201d\n\nInstinctively, Mike put his hand over the bullet hole.  He could feel blood well up underneath it.  Then Mike felt something else.  Something in the palm of his hand was moving.  It darted in and out, then writhed around in slow, circular motions over the surface of the wound.\n\nMike pulled his hand back.  Nestled in the middle of his palm was a little mouth, lined with sharp teeth.  A meaty tongue slithered out of it, lapping up Mike\u2019s blood.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Mike muttered to himself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the Hand, Mike.\u201d  Thompson told him.  \u201cLike I said, I recognized it as soon as I saw you.\u201d\n\nThe area around the mouth started to turn black, quickly spreading over his entire hand.  The discoloration formed into a thick, spiky resin.  Vicious looking claws sprouted from the tips of Mike\u2019s fingers, all six of them.\n\n\u201cLooks like you can see it now too,\u201d  Thompson said.\n\nMike looked up and saw Thompson put his gun back in its holster.  The cop seemed remarkably relaxed in the face of all the weird shit going on.  Mike certainly couldn\u2019t say the same.  He was too shocked to be scared, too confused to make sense out of anything, really.  The only thing he felt was revulsion.\n\n\u201cI believe you Mike,\u201d Thompson cut in, \u201cwhen you say you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.  Clearly you\u2019re new to this.\u201d\n\nAs Thompson spoke, he reached up and loosened his tie.  Then he undid the top button of his collar.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the Hand, you see.\u201d  Thompson continued.  \u201cThe Hand of the Destroyer.  Kyle Anderson, remember him?  He had the Whisper, the Whisper of the Hidden One.\u201d\n\nHe stopped talking and cleared his throat.  A deep, guttural hiss rose up in Thompson\u2019s chest.  It reminded Mike of how a crocodile sounds when it bellows.  Nothing about it was remotely human.\n\nThompson spoke again, only this time his voice was slimy and wet.  \u201cKyle tried to use the whisper on you back at the cellphone shop,\u201d Thompson said.  \u201cFigured he could quietly pick you off without anyone noticing.\u201d\n\nA burning sensation traveled through Mike\u2019s arm, coming to rest in the palm of his hand.  The feeling of revulsion was replaced with hunger, and rage.  The pain from his gunshot wounds faded to a dull roar.\n\n\u201cBut the Destroyer is tough to kill,\u201d  Thomson rasped out.  \u201cAnd so are you.  Aren\u2019t you Mike?\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s throat was pulsating.  Something was wiggling around inside of it, trying to force its way out.\n\n\u201cThen again,\u201d he gurgled.  \u201cSo am I.\u201d\n\nMike felt his fingers tighten into a fist.  \u201cDanger,\u201d a voice told him.  \u201cGet ready.\u201d  Even if Mike didn\u2019t understand what was happening, clearly his hand did.\n\nThompson\u2019s neck was grotesquely swollen.  When he spoke, Mike spotted a disgusting mass of green issue bubbling up in Thompson\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cHand of the Destroyer,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhisper of the Hidden One.\u201d\n\nThompson paused for a second, then hissed, \u201cTongue of the Worm.\u201d\n\nSeveral long tendrils shot out of Thompson\u2019s throat.  They unfurled into a sickening bouquet of moist tongues.  Each one bore a set of tiny, curved fangs.  They hissed and snarled, snapping at Mike as Thompson slowly walked toward him.\n\nOne of the tongues lashed out at Mike\u2019s face.  He tilted his head just in time to dodge it, but another tongue managed to latch onto Mike\u2019s torso, sinking its teeth in.  Mike reached around with his mutated hand and grabbed the tendril.  He felt the mouth in his palm take a bite.  The tendril let go, allowing Mike to pull it away from his body.\n\nMore and more of Thompson\u2019s tongues found their mark, though.  They coiled around Mike, tearing away chunks of his flesh bit by bit.  One slithered into the wound in Mike\u2019s abdomen.  He could feel it dig around inside his guts.\n\nIf Mike didn\u2019t act soon, Thompson was going to rip him to pieces.  But what could he do?  All he had was a tiny little mouth in the palm of his hand.\n\nIt was then that Mike felt the heat inside of his body swell.  With it came a burst of pure malice, a kind of hatred that was deeper and more abiding than anything Mike had experienced before.  He didn\u2019t just want to kill Thompson, he wanted to annihilate him.\n\nMike caught one of the tongues in his hand and twisted.  At the same time his palm bit down hard.  It went all the way through, severing the tongue completely.\n\nThompson let out a muffled yelp, then reeled backward.  His mouthful of tongues squirmed wildly.  The tendril burrowing through Mike\u2019s abdomen retracted.  Black, tar-like liquid poured from the opening it left behind.  As soon as the liquid hit the ground it ignited in a bright, yellow flash.\n\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 a,\u201d Mike thought.  \u201cMy blood is flammable!\u201d\n\nThat realization horrified, excited, and disgusted Mike all at once.  It also gave him an idea.  He placed his palm against his stomach.  He could feel the mouth inside lick up the slime gushing from his wound.  Instinct told him when it had eaten enough.  Then he stretched out his arm, opened his fist, and let it rip.\n\nThe Hand vomited a steady stream of tar all over Thompson.  Instantly it burst into flames, unleashing a cloud of smoke and cinders.  The tongues curled up and withered under the heat.  Thompson thrashed feebly, trying in vain to put the fire out.\n\nSeeing so much suffering and terror filled Mike with joy.  He reveled in the carnage, savoring the smell of charred flesh filling the air.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d Mike heard a voice say.  He couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from at first.  Then he felt his hand moving.\n\n\u201cGo under,\u201d the voice growled.\n\nIt was coming from his hand, Mike realized.  He turned his wrist.  The mouth in his palm grinned up at him.\n\n\u201cThat which is severed is still bound by blood,\u201d it said.  \u201cReunite what was undone.\u201d\n\nBursts of heat escaped from the mouth as it spoke, causing the air around it to ripple.  Mike felt every word reverberate throughout his body.  Whatever possessed him ran much deeper than just his hand.\n\n\u201cMake him complete,\u201d the mouth said.  The mention of \u201chim\u201d filled Mike with dread, though he didn't know why.\n\nA loud crash drew Mike\u2019s attention back to the alley.  He spotted something green and lanky scurry up a nearby fire escape, disappearing as it pulled itself over the top of the building.\n\nMike turned his head back to where Thompson was a minute ago.  In his place rested a pile of smoldering sludge.  Another sting of satisfaction struck Mike at the sight of his enemy\u2019s remains.  But then Mike spotted a trail of mucus stretching out from underneath the pile.  It led to the building with the fire escape.\n\n\u201cThe Destroyer is tough to kill,\u201d  Thompson had said earlier.  \u201cThen again, so am I.\u201d\n\nThe malice, the rage, the spiteful sadism left Mike all at once.  His hand felt lighter.  He looked at it.  The mouth, the claws, the sixth finger, they had all vanished.  So had the injuries caused by Thompson\u2019s attack.  Even the bullet wounds were gone.  As far as Mike could tell, he was healthy and back to normal.\n\nHis clothes were a mess though, ripped to shreds and stained with a variety of different fluids.  That feeling of revulsion returned.  There was something inside of Mike, something powerful and cruel.  Mike was nearly overwhelmed by its malice.  The Hand granted him unnatural abilities, but it also threatened to subsume him.\n\nMike\u2019s encounter with Thompson, the Tongue of Worm, was already a blur in his mind.  It all seemed so impossible, so far-fetched.  His memory was fading, Mike realized, just like it had with Kyle Anderson.  Pretty soon Mike would have no idea where he was or how he got there.\n\nMike needed to remember though.  So much damage had already been done.  He was wanted for murder, and now he was on the run from the cops, one of whom was secretly a monster in disguise.  If he forgot everything that had happened he\u2019d be back to square one, clueless and hunted, running for his life without knowing why.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d Mike heard a voice echo in his mind.  \u201cMake him whole again.\u201d\n\nMike felt grounded all of a sudden, his thoughts crystallized.  The memory of his encounter with Thompson came back into focus.  Clearly, whatever evil was inside Mike had a vested interest in keeping him clear-headed.  Mike needed the Hand and the Hand needed him, at least for the time being.\n\nIf Mike wanted to make it through this, he would have to, \u201cgo under.\u201d  He\u2019d have to find what was severed and reunite it.  Mike would have to find a way to, \u201cmake him whole,\u201d whatever the hell that meant.\n\n\u201cHim,\u201d just the thought of that word sent a shiver down Mike\u2019s spine.  \u201cHand of the Destroyer,\u201d Thompson had called Mike.  But who or what was the Destroyer, and why had it chosen Mike to be its Hand?\n\nMike needed answers.", "index": "red11_s16_", "post_comments": [{"index": "red11_s16_c0_", "comment_text": "Mike\u2019s knuckles were throbbing.

The cop seemed remarkably relaxed in the face of all the weird shit going on.  Mike certainly couldn\u2019t say the same.  He was too shocked to be scared, too confused to make sense out of anything, really.  The only thing he felt was revulsion.\n\n\u201cI believe you Mike,\u201d Thompson cut in, \u201cwhen you say you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.  Clearly you\u2019re new to this.\u201d\n\nAs Thompson spoke, he reached up and loosened his tie.  Then he undid the top button of his collar.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the Hand, you see.\u201d  Thompson continued.  \u201cThe Hand of the Destroyer.  Kyle Anderson, remember him?  He had the Whisper, the Whisper of the Hidden One.\u201d\n\nHe stopped talking and cleared his throat.  A deep, guttural hiss rose up in Thompson\u2019s chest.  It reminded Mike of how a crocodile sounds when it bellows.  Nothing about it was remotely human.\n\nThompson spoke again, only this time his voice was slimy and wet.  \u201cKyle tried to use the whisper on you back at the cellphone shop,\u201d Thompson said.  \u201cFigured he could quietly pick you off without anyone noticing.\u201d\n\nA burning sensation traveled through Mike\u2019s arm, coming to rest in the palm of his hand.  The feeling of revulsion was replaced with hunger, and rage.  The pain from his gunshot wounds faded to a dull roar.\n\n\u201cBut the Destroyer is tough to kill,\u201d  Thomson rasped out.  \u201cAnd so are you.  Aren\u2019t you Mike?\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s throat was pulsating.  Something was wiggling around inside of it, trying to force its way out.\n\n\u201cThen again,\u201d he gurgled.  \u201cSo am I.\u201d\n\nMike felt his fingers tighten into a fist.  \u201cDanger,\u201d a voice told him.  \u201cGet ready.\u201d  Even if Mike didn\u2019t understand what was happening, clearly his hand did.\n\nThompson\u2019s neck was grotesquely swollen.  When he spoke, Mike spotted a disgusting mass of green issue bubbling up in Thompson\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cHand of the Destroyer,\u201d he said.  \u201cWhisper of the Hidden One.\u201d\n\nThompson paused for a second, then hissed, \u201cTongue of the Worm.\u201d\n\nSeveral long tendrils shot out of Thompson\u2019s throat.  They unfurled into a sickening bouquet of moist tongues.  Each one bore a set of tiny, curved fangs.  They hissed and snarled, snapping at Mike as Thompson slowly walked toward him.\n\nOne of the tongues lashed out at Mike\u2019s face.  He tilted his head just in time to dodge it, but another tongue managed to latch onto Mike\u2019s torso, sinking its teeth in.  Mike reached around with his mutated hand and grabbed the tendril.  He felt the mouth in his palm take a bite.  The tendril let go, allowing Mike to pull it away from his body.\n\nMore and more of Thompson\u2019s tongues found their mark, though.  They coiled around Mike, tearing away chunks of his flesh bit by bit.  One slithered into the wound in Mike\u2019s abdomen.  He could feel it dig around inside his guts.\n\nIf Mike didn\u2019t act soon, Thompson was going to rip him to pieces.  But what could he do?  All he had was a tiny little mouth in the palm of his hand.\n\nIt was then that Mike felt the heat inside of his body swell.  With it came a burst of pure malice, a kind of hatred that was deeper and more abiding than anything Mike had experienced before.  He didn\u2019t just want to kill Thompson, he wanted to annihilate him.\n\nMike caught one of the tongues in his hand and twisted.  At the same time his palm bit down hard.  It went all the way through, severing the tongue completely.\n\nThompson let out a muffled yelp, then reeled backward.  His mouthful of tongues squirmed wildly.  The tendril burrowing through Mike\u2019s abdomen retracted.  Black, tar-like liquid poured from the opening it left behind.  As soon as the liquid hit the ground it ignited in a bright, yellow flash.\n\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 a,\u201d Mike thought.  \u201cMy blood is flammable!\u201d\n\nThat realization horrified, excited, and disgusted Mike all at once.  It also gave him an idea.  He placed his palm against his stomach.  He could feel the mouth inside lick up the slime gushing from his wound.  Instinct told him when it had eaten enough.  Then he stretched out his arm, opened his fist, and let it rip.\n\nThe Hand vomited a steady stream of tar all over Thompson.  Instantly it burst into flames, unleashing a cloud of smoke and cinders.  The tongues curled up and withered under the heat.  Thompson thrashed feebly, trying in vain to put the fire out.\n\nSeeing so much suffering and terror filled Mike with joy.  He reveled in the carnage, savoring the smell of charred flesh filling the air.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d Mike heard a voice say.  He couldn\u2019t tell where it was coming from at first.  Then he felt his hand moving.\n\n\u201cGo under,\u201d the voice growled.\n\nIt was coming from his hand, Mike realized.  He turned his wrist.  The mouth in his palm grinned up at him.\n\n\u201cThat which is severed is still bound by blood,\u201d it said.  \u201cReunite what was undone.\u201d\n\nBursts of heat escaped from the mouth as it spoke, causing the air around it to ripple.  Mike felt every word reverberate throughout his body.  Whatever possessed him ran much deeper than just his hand.\n\n\u201cMake him complete,\u201d the mouth said.  The mention of \u201chim\u201d filled Mike with dread, though he didn't know why.\n\nA loud crash drew Mike\u2019s attention back to the alley.  He spotted something green and lanky scurry up a nearby fire escape, disappearing as it pulled itself over the top of the building.\n\nMike turned his head back to where Thompson was a minute ago.  In his place rested a pile of smoldering sludge.  Another sting of satisfaction struck Mike at the sight of his enemy\u2019s remains.  But then Mike spotted a trail of mucus stretching out from underneath the pile.  It led to the building with the fire escape.\n\n\u201cThe Destroyer is tough to kill,\u201d  Thompson had said earlier.  \u201cThen again, so am I.\u201d\n\nThe malice, the rage, the spiteful sadism left Mike all at once.  His hand felt lighter.  He looked at it.  The mouth, the claws, the sixth finger, they had all vanished.  So had the injuries caused by Thompson\u2019s attack.  Even the bullet wounds were gone.  As far as Mike could tell, he was healthy and back to normal.\n\nHis clothes were a mess though, ripped to shreds and stained with a variety of different fluids.  That feeling of revulsion returned.  There was something inside of Mike, something powerful and cruel.  Mike was nearly overwhelmed by its malice.  The Hand granted him unnatural abilities, but it also threatened to subsume him.\n\nMike\u2019s encounter with Thompson, the Tongue of Worm, was already a blur in his mind.  It all seemed so impossible, so far-fetched.  His memory was fading, Mike realized, just like it had with Kyle Anderson.  Pretty soon Mike would have no idea where he was or how he got there.\n\nMike needed to remember though.  So much damage had already been done.  He was wanted for murder, and now he was on the run from the cops, one of whom was secretly a monster in disguise.  If he forgot everything that had happened he\u2019d be back to square one, clueless and hunted, running for his life without knowing why.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d Mike heard a voice echo in his mind.  \u201cMake him whole again.\u201d\n\nMike felt grounded all of a sudden, his thoughts crystallized.  The memory of his encounter with Thompson came back into focus.  Clearly, whatever evil was inside Mike had a vested interest in keeping him clear-headed.  Mike needed the Hand and the Hand needed him, at least for the time being.\n\nIf Mike wanted to make it through this, he would have to, \u201cgo under.\u201d  He\u2019d have to find what was severed and reunite it.  Mike would have to find a way to, \u201cmake him whole,\u201d whatever the hell that meant.\n\n\u201cHim,\u201d just the thought of that word sent a shiver down Mike\u2019s spine.  \u201cHand of the Destroyer,\u201d Thompson had called Mike.  But who or what was the Destroyer, and why had it chosen Mike to be its Hand?\n\nMike needed answers.", "comment_created_utc": 1714313362.0, "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

His stern expression and yellowish eyes hinted at a stubbornness that caught Ailemu off guard.   \n\u201c$5,000,\u201d Saadou said in a thick northeast accent.   \nFor a moment, Ailemu\u2019s heart leaped with joy: for a moment.  \n\u201cFor\u202625 cows,\u201d Saadou continued. \u201cWhere is the other man? I am not selling the rest 50 until I see how much the other man wants to buy.\u201d He had already heard of both the \u201cfat man\u201d and \u201cshort man with no neck\u201d from his fellow countrymen who conducted businesses in the northern province. He knew all about their messengers and scouts of boys and could easily spot them as they got nearer and nearer to the river.  \n\u201cMy brother,\u201d Ailemu said, taking off his kufi and scratching his shiny bald head. \u201c$5,000 is too big a price for 25 cows. $2,500 is better.\u201d  \n\u201c$5,000. $5,000 is the price. 25 cows, $5,000.\u201d  \nAilemu put his kufi back on and smiled. He assessed the situation with a shrewd glint in his eyes. He knew the delicate dance of negotiating with hardened cattle herders from the backcountry. A dance that required finesse and one that he had done many times over, far before hiring Abu. Leaning in, he adopted a congenial tone, as if sharing a secret with an old friend.  \n\"Saadou, my brother,\" Ailemu began, gesturing towards the bushy landscape around them, \"you've traveled a long way, and I can see these cows are strong. But you see, brother, $5,000 is much much for 25 cows. Let's not rush this. Just see clear my deal, eh.\"  \nSaadou's stern facade remained intact, but there was a flicker of curiosity in his eyes. Ailemu seized the opportunity, continuing his dance.  \n\"Now, I know the price of your cows, and I respect much much my brother,\" Ailemu said, feigning a contemplative look. \"But, let me make my deal sweet. I have a big house, not far from here, with big big bedrooms and big beds for a king. Look at this, eh. With the 25 cows, I'll provide you and your two children with a enjoyable stay at my place. No extra price. You rest, relax, and we finish the deal. No rush.\"  \nSaadou's eyes, which had been fixed on Ailemu, shifted to his two travel companions. His gaze softened as he observed the five-year-old and ten-year-old. Tegedantay's once-vibrant eyes, now dulled by exhaustion, looked up at him, silently pleading for respite. Sulieman, trying to put on a brave front, couldn't conceal the weariness etched into his young face. Dust-covered and with drooping shoulders, they clung to each other for support, their eyes reflecting the fatigue of almost 30 days on the road.   \nA widening smile tugged at the corner of Ailemu\u2019s mouth, sensing the shift in Saadou's resolve. This negotiation wasn't just about cows and money.   \n\"Brother Saadou,\" Ailemu pressed on, his voice filled with understanding, \"I see the journey is hard on your little ones. Let them rest, and enjoy the comfort of my home. There's no rush in the deal, eh. Let\u2019s talk over a warm meal and finish everything when you are ready.\"  \nNestled in the heart of the northern province, Ailemu's two-story residence stood as a testament to opulence by local standards. The second floor sheltered his family, while the first floor welcomed esteemed guests, particularly significant (qualifying at minimum 10 cows) cattle sellers. Six spacious bedrooms on this level, graced with king-sized beds, offered a haven for the wayfarer. The first floor also featured a dining room, a kitchen area, and a living room adorned with the softest Persian rug.  \nBeyond its architectural charm, Ailemu's house boasted a dedicated staff\u2014houseboys, housegirls, and cooks\u2014all diligently trained to cater to the whims and desires of residents and guests alike. The house served as a strategic asset in negotiations, where comfort and hospitality played pivotal roles in sealing deals.  \n\"Shaiku may have the mountains, but I have the house!\" Ailemu often quipped to his inner circle and Abu.  \n**Thus, the resolution** was reached that day, sealed with complimentary lodging. Ailemu, flanked by his four houseboys, guided Saadou, his \"little ones,\" and their cattle toward the grandeur of his two-story residence. The cattle found refuge in a dedicated enclosure within Ailemu's expansive compound, strategically positioned for scrutiny. Separated yet close to the house, the enclosure allowed for easy observation and peace of mind for the house guests.  \nSaadou, Tegedantay, and Sulieman were ushered into snug bedrooms, designed for their comfort. One bedroom with its king size bed accommodated the adult and the other for the two children.  \nOnce settled, Ailemu extended an invitation for dinner, an opportunity for the guests to share a meal with him and his family. The evening's culinary delight consisted of chicken stew accompanied by fluffy white rice: its aroma enveloping the room and teasing taste buds. As appetites were sated from the main course, Ailemu unveiled a mouth-watering treat\u2014round, fried donuts generously filled with jam from freshly picked blueberries.  \nPost-dinner, the men excused themselves, leaving the wife and children to enjoy each other\u2019s company. In the living room, a silver teapot brimming with mint tea and two delicate glass cups arranged on a silver tray awaited the two. Nestled on the plush Persian rug, they indulged in a soothing ritual that was the essence of welcoming hospitality in their region.  \nIn each other's company, the two men delved into their shared backgrounds, uncovering tales of harsh fathers, distant mothers, and the early shouldering of familial responsibilities. Amidst the complexities of family dynamics, including sibling rivalry and occasional hostility, Ailemu learned that Tegedantay was Saadou's daughter, and Sulieman, his nephew.   \nAs the night wore on, Ailemu and Saadou became engrossed in conversation. Ailemu, always the master of levity, cracked a well-timed joke that brought an unexpected smile to the stern-faced cattle herder. The tension had eased, replaced by genuine camaraderie as the two men shared stories, both humorous and poignant. The living room\u2019s grandfather clock struck midnight and neither man showed no signs of weariness.  \n**It was just** before the clock struck an hour past midnight, Ailemu introduced a sleek black briefcase into the conversation. He opened it to unveil a meticulous arrangement of bills\u2014$100s, $50s, $20s, $10s, 5s, and singles, neatly packed. With practiced hands, Ailemu counted out $2,500, presenting the amount to Saadou. \"This is the agreed price for the 25 cows, eh?\" Saadou nodded in satisfaction, accepting the stacked bills with a sense of finality.  \nThe night concluded with an agreement to reconvene negotiations for the remaining 50 cows on the morrow. Ailemu, true to his reputation for hospitality, extended an offer for Saadou and his family to stay another night. However, should negotiations falter, he made it clear that his houseboys would personally escort them to Shaiku for a potentially better offer. The two men bidded each other good night, each looking forward to the next day\u2019s transacting.  \n**Startled from his** deep slumber, Ailemu was abruptly woken by rapid knocks on his bedroom door. (However, his wife, a heavy sleeper, remained undisturbed.) The frantic voice of his house girl pierced the night's silence. \"Bossman, bossman!\"  \nWiping away the remnants of sleep, Ailemu groggily swung his legs over the side of the bed and followed the girl's voice. He opened the bedroom door to find the house girl, who was wide-eyed and clearly distressed. \u201cHe\u2019s not well,\u201d she said urgently. \u201cHe\u2019s not well. Come.\u201d Ailemu stumbled through the stairway and the dimly lit corridor, guided only by the faint moonlight seeping through the windows.  \nUpon reaching the guest room, the house girl flung open the door, revealing the huddled shapes of two small bodies. Panicking, Ailemu fumbled in the darkness, urgently calling for a flashlight. He was startled when the house girl's hands unexpectedly placed a cold metal object against his stomach. \"Oh,\" he mumbled, grabbing the flashlight from her.  \nAs the light revealed the room's inhabitants, Ailemu's gaze shifted from the terror-stricken faces of Tegedantay and Sulieman to the sweating and pulsating chest of Saadou. He moved his flashlight further up to the man\u2019s face and then saw the look. A chilling recognition washed over as he recalled seeing the same look afflicting other family members in the past. Saadou, the strong and stoic herder from the northeast, now lay helpless, his face yellowing as he struggled to speak, blood seeping from his mouth.  \nA doctor was summoned immediately, and upon arrival in the morning, delivered a prognosis that did not surprise Ailemu. The medical jargon notwithstanding, the plain truth was that Saadou's chances of survival were slim, rendering a long trip to the hospital futile.  \nAs the day unfolded, Saadou's condition rapidly deteriorated\u2014vomiting blood, high fever, dark bloody diarrhea, and seizures followed. By nightfall, he succumbed to his ailment, leaving behind $2,500, 50 cows, and two orphaned children.  \n**Following the province's** religion and culture, an immediate burial was imperative within 24 hours. Keen to spare the children from witnessing their guardian's interment, Ailemu directed his houseboys to take Tegedantay and Sulieman on a tour of his compound and all his cattle, while the community laid Saadou to rest.  \nPost-burial, discussions with the community elders ensued regarding the fate of Saadou's possessions and the young children. A consensus emerged that the eldest child, Sulieman, should be escorted back to the northeast to inform his family of the tragic news. On a Friday, two days after Saadou's passing, 10-year-old Suleiman, accompanied by Abu, embarked on a journey to the river to return to his homeland.  \n/The Business of Cow.

The medical jargon notwithstanding, the plain truth was that Saadou's chances of survival were slim, rendering a long trip to the hospital futile.  \nAs the day unfolded, Saadou's condition rapidly deteriorated\u2014vomiting blood, high fever, dark bloody diarrhea, and seizures followed. By nightfall, he succumbed to his ailment, leaving behind $2,500, 50 cows, and two orphaned children.  \n**Following the province's** religion and culture, an immediate burial was imperative within 24 hours. Keen to spare the children from witnessing their guardian's interment, Ailemu directed his houseboys to take Tegedantay and Sulieman on a tour of his compound and all his cattle, while the community laid Saadou to rest.  \nPost-burial, discussions with the community elders ensued regarding the fate of Saadou's possessions and the young children. A consensus emerged that the eldest child, Sulieman, should be escorted back to the northeast to inform his family of the tragic news. On a Friday, two days after Saadou's passing, 10-year-old Suleiman, accompanied by Abu, embarked on a journey to the river to return to his homeland.  \n/The Business of Cow.

{"post_title": "Manahouc Holler [SF]", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1cfed6x/manahouc_holler_sf/", "created_utc": 1714331585.0, "text": "   When winter came to my house in these hills, the town would often send a boy every once in a while to make sure I was ok, especially before a snowstorm. Often, they would send one of the William\u2019s boys, usually the youngest one, Jim. Jim was a bright eyed boy of around sixteen that looked just like his grandfather. He was a kind boy, and would always let me sit and ramble about times past as us grey haired folk tend to do.\n\n   \u201cJim! it's great to see you.\u201d I say to him, eyes beaming with a happiness, eager to have company. He had the glow of youth you forget you lose as you age. \u201cHell, it's damn cold. Let\u2019s get you warmed up.\u201d I commanded, first closing the door and then guiding him to the chair by fire. As I sat down in the seat opposite, he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up pop? How is life up here, need anything?\u201d His face was a mix of curiosity, and concern. The face you make when any older person is talking, I suppose.\n\n   I took a deep breath, and dismissing of pleasantries, I realized its about time for a tale almost as old as me. When I asked if he wanted to hear a story, he nodded his head, and i began. I started telling him the story of the Manahouc Holler, staring into the fire.\n\n\n\n   Manahouc was the name of the tribe that lived here in these hills long before the white man came. They were a proud and mighty people, who fought for their land, who knew the secrets of this land and the things within the woods. In a rare case, the US government did not see the need in anymore fighting for such a small piece of land, they made a deal with the natives. The small remnants of the tribe were to have one holler for themselves. Now obviously, they gave them the smallest and most useless one they could find.\n\n   When my father moved from Ireland as a boy, his father had just enough money to buy a small patch of land to feed his family, right beside the Manahouc Holler. Being from Ireland, he had a soft spot in his heart for the natives, as he could sympathize with the English intruding. He only left because they had pushed him to via starvation. He taught my father to treat them with respect because they knew the land more, which may become a valuable friend in hard times. A lesson my father taught to me.\n\n   That\u2019s why, at age 20, when I saw a native man lost in a freak blizzard, I got him in, fed him some of my wife\u2019s warm food, and let him stay until the storm had passed. I didn\u2019t think nothing of it, but after that they started treating us real well. They would give us occasional good deals, gifts, the like. We got to know our surprise visitor real well. His real name was some native word for \"foolish\" I cannot remember, lost to time I suppose. The name he said I could call him, after butchering his real name a couple times, was Brother John. He picked that name after a book character he liked.\n\n   Brother John was the main farmer for the dwindling tribe. Everyone farmed, but it seemed he was the only one making money off it for them. Despite reported bad soil and a small overall operation, he always outproduced everyone around him. Droughts, floods, it didn\u2019t matter.\n\n   That is what angered the rich white farmers the most, that a supposed \u201cdumb savage\u201d was outproducing them. They would often discuss what to do, in their mansions and estates. But none was ever so bold as to try anything. Eventually, they sent two \u201cgood ole boys\u201d to sabotage their crops a time or two. But no matter what they tried, it either failed or the damage that was done, was minimal.\n\n   Soon, rumors started going around town as rumors tend to do. I heard everything from a blessing to soothe the past, to black magic revenging it. Reported signs of mythical beasts prowling the shadows, stealing chickens. From native tales to folklore from the motherland. I never believed any of it though. Brother John was kind, and helpful. I couldn\u2019t see him partaking in anything nefarious. I assumed they just knew the plants and land better than we did.\n\n   Well, about 10 years after i saved Brother John, prohibition came to the county. It was graciously accepted by the elites. Most of them were Southern Baptists and saw it as a way to control the predominately Catholic and Presbyterian common folk. An added benefit was that prohibition allowed them to spread rumors about moonshine stills in Manahouc Holler as a way to divert from their moonshine stills. Then force them out by acting on these claims.\n\n   With the support of the elites, Sheriff Connolly and his 20 new deputies went into Manahouc Holler. The word from the reputable elites was that the whole tribe had been involved in crime. When \"men of the law\" came into the grouping of huts that was the tribe, they found no one, alive nor dead. Not even a sign of life. It was like only the huts had ever existed there.\n\n   When they spread out to examine the property, they were picked off one by one. Beasts of the forest, ranging from wolves and stags to cougars and bears were taking these men into the shadowy forest. From  the scream, it sounded like the animals hated these men, taking their time with them. A young man brought in to be a helping hand to the posse was Chester Russell, and he was also the only man left alive. Chester was a black man and was a sharecropper on the property of James E. Alexander, the richest man in town. He saw the carnage begin and bolted right out of the camp. As he fled, he could hear animals chasing him. He had never ran that fast, almost like he was being helped by the wind, he would claim later.\n\n   He made it to the property line and looked back, seeing the animals stop at the tree line. According to Chester, they just sat there, growling or grunting. Most thought Chester was lying, either to cover up the truth, or to gain attention. I knew Chester pretty well, and knew when he was lying. Awful poker player, that man. I knew he was telling the truth.\n\n   He would only tell me the details if I bought him a bottle of whiskey, though. He claimed that remembering it was like asking to be punched in the face. The way their red eyes looked at him, as if knowing exactly who he was. The stench, the pack smelled of death, of rotting, of decay. He swore that further behind property line, there was a beast that towered over the others, hidden in the shadows save for the giant, blood red eyes.\n\n   I knew he was telling the truth, but it didn\u2019t matter what I thought, at least not to the rich. See, after a year without word from the natives, the rich landowners agreed to split the holler amongst themselves. Each would receive an equal part. As time went on, however, these families would start to experience hardships. They would either rack up heavy debts and then end up paying off them off by selling all their possessions, or they move out west. Either way, these families faded into obscurity.\n\n   Eventually, even the Alexanders would face hardships. They were the richest, and the last ones of those elites. The only surviving Alexander would hang himself in his mansion losing all his money on drugs and women, which was back in the 70s. Since then, there hasn\u2019t been a buyer, it is technically property of the state.\n\nNo one ever saw the Manahouc again.\n\n\n\n   After concluding my story, I leaned back, and took a long gulp of the water Jim had poured me. He sat there for a while without speaking.\n\n\u201cI think I believe you,\u201d he said, breaking the silence. \u201cbut why tell me this?\u201d\n\n   \u201cJim, you see, Brother John\u2019s father was the medicine man for the tribe. When he heard what I had done for his son, he personally visited us. He blessed me with the \u2018gift of life and vitality of two men\u2019. I didn\u2019t know what to say, so I just accepted it. I didn\u2019t think he ever actually blessed me with longer life in that encounter for years and years, but now I am sure of it.\u201d I leaned in real close, as if trying to whisper in a room that had a crowd in it, not just Jim and I.\n\n  \u201cI tend to hide my age, and I beg the few that know my age to keep it a secret. You see Jim, this story took place in the 1921. I am 144 years old, and I feel that my time may be finally coming to an end, and someone young needs to know this story.\"", "index": "red11_s18_", "post_comments": []}
