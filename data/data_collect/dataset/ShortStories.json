Do you have a self-established universe you\u2019ve been writing or planning to write in? Do you have an idea for a world that\u2019s been itching to get out? This is the perfect place to explore that. Each week, I post a theme to inspire you, along with a related image and song. You have 500 - 1000 words to write your installment. You can jump in at any time; writing for previous weeks\u2019 is not necessary in order to join. After you\u2019ve posted, come back and provide feedback for at least 1 other writer on the thread. Please be sure to read the entire post for a full list of rules.\n***\n#This Week\u2019s Theme is Queen!       \n\n[**Image**](https://www.deviantart.com/cvanilda/art/A-bow-for-Scarlet-872508655)  | [**Song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqBKrJnA8ZY)            \n    \n**Bonus Word List** (each included word is worth 5 pts) - **Please list which words you included at the end of your story.**                  \n- querulous                                \n- quaint                                                                                                   \n- quintessence                                                                                                                      \n- quickened         \n                                          \n         \nOriginally just meaning a woman monarch (often due to their marriage with a king), \u201cqueen\u201d has grown over the years to accumulate many different shades of meaning. Regardless of whether it refers to honest-to-goodness royalty, prom queens, drag queens, or anything in between, queens are usually associated with femininity, beauty, and the power that comes with both. How does your \u201cqueen\u201d react to this? Are they self-assured, confident in their femininity and strength? Do they flinch away, desperately clinging to a preconceived mask as they secretly crumble under the weight of their own or others\u2019 expectations? What does your queen and how people react to them say about the concept of feminine power in your world? What sort of role model is your \u201cqueen\u201d? Are the traits they embody considered \u201cgood\u201d? Or do they become \u201cevil\u201d when viewed from the conventions of the world?      \n\n\nOr perhaps your characters might simply take a break and play chess, cards, or suddenly start rocking out to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d. Now go have fun with it! *Blurb provided by u/wandering_cirrus.*       \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n- April 7 - Queen (this week)         \n- April 14 - Recovery    \n- April 21 - Struggle    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Perception](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/sersun_serial_sunday_perception/)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxnkgi4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel             \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/ky3fbhu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/OldBayJ         \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxoz94k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing            \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxt32uq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/AGuyLikeThat                \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/ky3o035/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/Zetakh                          \n         \n\n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below. This feature has requirements for participation!     \n\n- **Submit a story inspired by the weekly theme, written by you and set in your *self-established* universe that is 500 - 1000 words. No fanfics and no content created or altered by AI.** (Use wordcounter.net to check your wordcount.) Stories should be posted as a top-level comment below. If you\u2019re continuing an in-progress serial (not on Serial Sunday), please include links to your previous installments. \n\n- **Your chapter must be submitted by Saturday at 9:00am EST.** Late entries will be disqualified. All submissions should be given (at least) a *basic editing pass* before being posted!\n\n- **Begin your post with the name of your serial between triangle brackets** (e.g. <My Awesome Serial>). When our bot is back up and running, this will allow it to recognize your serial and add each chapter to the SerSun catalog. Do not include anything in the brackets you don\u2019t want in your title. (Please note: You must use this same title every week.)\n\n- **Do not pre-write your serial.** You\u2019re welcome to do outlining and planning for your serial, but chapters should not be pre-written. All submissions should be written for this post, specifically.\n\n- **Only one active serial per author at a time.** This does not apply to serials written outside of Serial Sunday. \n\n- **All Serial Sunday authors must leave feedback on at least one story on the thread each week.** The feedback should be **actionable** and also include something the author has done well. When you include something the author should improve on, provide an example! You have until **Saturday at 11:59pm EST** to post your feedback. (Submitting late is not an exception to this rule.)     \n\n- **Missing your feedback requirement two or more consecutive weeks will disqualify you from rankings and Campfire readings the following week.** If it becomes a habit, you may be asked to move your serial to the sub instead.\n\n- **Serials must abide by subreddit content rules.** You can view a [full list of rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/index/rules).

She was fed by a detachable rotary magazine which could fit only twenty-eight rounds a piece. Technically, they were thirty round magazines, but if you loaded more then twenty-eight cartridges into them, the weapon was sure to jam. That withstanding, what she lacked in munitions quantity expenditure, she made up for with her destructive personality.\n\nMost everyone hated carrying Olga. Aside from her heft, the foot-mobile artillery piece tried its best to separate you from your shoulder any time you brought it to bare. I won\u2019t lie, I grew kind of fond of the thing, as she and I came to an understanding very early on.\n\nCharlie 6-4 was a motley lot who'd stretch the uniformed regulations of the Federal Marine Force, or FMF, to their very limits. In the oppressive summer on Nowhere, we often patrolled without a cammie blouse under our shield-generation armored vests. Better known as a flack, its nomenclature was derived from a time amidst Earth\u2019s three world wars. This left just a brown skivvy, or t-shirt, between our skin and the protective shield generator rig.\n\nOur helmets too, were decorated with a flare for the original. We shrouded this headgear with a rumpled tan-pixelated cover which obscured the helmet\u2019s semi-gloss surface from all the world to see. Girls would personalize this cotton vail with their call-signs or ironic quotes like \u201cGave Peace a Chance\u201d inked into the starched fabric.\n\nStitched to the back of my helmet-cover was a black rectangular patch with the word \u201cJACKIE\u201d embroidered onto it with scarlet colored threading. It might seem messed up the girls sowed it on there without my knowledge, but it was just their way of saying, \u201cyou\u2019re one of us now!\u201d \n\nTwo months into my tour, Head-Shed, that\u2019s the command element, gave all garrison combat teams the directive to search for weapons cashes in the remote settlements on the Great Forgotten Lake. These villages were built on the edge of a dried-up inland sea, which was nothing more then a salt-flat two hundred kilometers across.\n\nCharlie 6-4 was further tasked with escorting a journalist as they documented Federal counter insurgency operations on Nowhere. Gunny wasn\u2019t thrilled with the idea of some nosy reporter tagging along with her Marines, so she personally joined our team for the mission. On patrol, she wore her weathered forest-green Raider-Commando beret tucked over the side of short, fading dirt-blonde hair. Affixed to it was an empty globe which represented Earth, with a wreath of figs on either flank of the half sphere. It was a privilege she earned at great personal expense, and even our officers were\u00a0wise enough to let that one be.\n\nRaider-Commando teams were elite in the FMF. Their custom fitted battle rigs made it possible to fight high-intensity conflicts anywhere, to include the vacuum of space. Charlie 6-4; we were light infantry, equipped for less intense operations in atmospheric, terrestrial environments. Aside from the flack vest and helmet, our battle-rattle consisted of a thin biometrically integrated exoskeleton, or EXO, which assisted with heavy loads and fatigue. \n\nGeneral Robotics hadn\u2019t considered male physiology when they designed the LISA-C, or Light Infantry System, Augmented Consciousness. Aside from the discomfort caused by my physical incompatibility with the thing, its AI started giving me the cold shoulder so to speak, when I purposefully ignored her advice in some less then desirable situations. Spend a few hours arguing with an artificial consciousness designed to integrate with the female mind, and I\u2019d bet you\u2019d become the first grunt in combat without an operable AI since the Battle of Formosa.\n\nI liked the newshawk from the start. They wasn\u2019t much older then sergeant Michaux when they became an interstellar war correspondent for The Alta-Californian. At the independent news agency, they was galactically renowned for their hard nosed, realist journalism, with several prestigious awards before turning thirty. I guess it helped they wasn\u2019t able to return home either, given an ambiguous citizenship matter with the Federal Administration.\n\nBy the time we met on Nowhere, she went by the name Abby Edward; a clever inversion of her family and given name. Abby was Gunny Campbell\u2019s age by then, and her preserved athleticism meant she had no problem keeping up with the team when she embedded on a patrol.\n\nWe took to calling her \u201cRoyal Purple\u201d, or just RP for short, due to the deep highlights woven through her otherwise raven hair. Her olive-drab flight suit and tan leather boots contrasted against the Prussian blue \u201cPRESS\u201d flack they made her ware. Atop her tangled crown was a floppy-brimmed cover with the bolded words \u201cTRUTH BEFORE DISHONOR\u201d scribed in dark ink. It was fair to say we all respected her for that.\n\n\u201cJackie,\u201d Kroger whispered from behind me, \u201cask her!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now Kroger!\u201d I hushed back.\n\n\u201cAsk me what, Owens?\u201d Gunny Campbell interjected from eight meters ahead of me.\n\n\u201cCom\u2019on Jackie, don\u2019t be a pussy,\u201d Lexi added on as she continued to walk forward in parallel, ten meters to my left.\n\n\u201cOK Jackie; what is it you want to know?\u201d Gunny asked with a broad smile after finally learning my call-sign.\n\n\u201cUm, well me, and some of the girls, were wondering\u2026 why is it you carry a knife on your chest-rig; given the distances involved\u00a0 with interstellar warfare and all?\u201d\n\n\u201cHayup\u2026 you never know Owens, there might be cake,\u201d she cryptically mused. \n\nOur laughter crackled from the staggered column stretched amidst the outskirts of the arid villa. This disturbed a perched loiter of several men who guarded an adobe structure which served as their municipal hub. Nobodies were humans descendent from Earth, but with a history briefly departed from our own. Unlike most of known humanity, nearly half their population were born male. Their arbitrary isolation had saved them in that way.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nW/C 996\n\nNote: In modern western militaries, particularly the US army, the infantry is known simply as \u201cQueen of Battle\u201d. \n\n\u00a0[No Man's Land Chapter 1: Letter of Intent ](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/s/UV8D69Bp5k)\n\n[No Man's Land Chapter 2: Stolen Valor ](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/s/wDcGEoVFn9)"}, {"comment_text": "Howdy Mattox!\n\nAbbreviated feedback during WORD OFF \n\nI like the intro paragraph going into detail about the old-fashioned gun followed closely by some sci-fi elements like the shield-generation vests.

As a child of the 1980s, it still takes some getting use to but there are some situations where they/them are singular pronouns. A call back to this is how Abby Edward's name is an inversion of her original given name. This assumes she was born Edward Abby. I was doing my best to convey this transitional aspect about the character without just plainly stating it. Hopefully it makes more sense now.\n\nYes the AI thing is going to be present through much of the combat scenes in this story, but not exactly how you would think.\n\nFuture history is very important to this story but I am taking an omitted/fragmented approach to this exposition. Few people talk about what happened five hundred years ago, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a profound effect on our lives today.

Regardless of whether it refers to honest-to-goodness royalty, prom queens, drag queens, or anything in between, queens are usually associated with femininity, beauty, and the power that comes with both. How does your \u201cqueen\u201d react to this? Are they self-assured, confident in their femininity and strength? Do they flinch away, desperately clinging to a preconceived mask as they secretly crumble under the weight of their own or others\u2019 expectations? What does your queen and how people react to them say about the concept of feminine power in your world? What sort of role model is your \u201cqueen\u201d? Are the traits they embody considered \u201cgood\u201d? Or do they become \u201cevil\u201d when viewed from the conventions of the world?      \n\n\nOr perhaps your characters might simply take a break and play chess, cards, or suddenly start rocking out to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d. Now go have fun with it! *Blurb provided by u/wandering_cirrus.*       \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started.

She just pointed again. \u201cLet\u2019s go down there. We\u2019re here, aren\u2019t we? Might as well take a look around.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to do that,\u201d Elfo said. \u201cIf Lena wants to.\u201d\n\nLena frowned, turning back to look at the empty air of the room. \u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the leader of your party.\u201d There was a pause, then the voice continued. \u201cBack on `Earth`, many years ago, the stars were used by people to guide them and to lead them as they explored new lands, and eventually into the void\u2014providing comfort with stories and tradition as they did so. I see you as a similar star to your group, and to the people of your land. A fire in the darkness.\u201d\n\nVeska nodded along. \u201cTold you,\u201d she said softly.\n\n\u201cThat is why I think you are the leader.\u201d Another pause. \u201cWould you like to go down to the `polar` side?\u201d\n\nLena looked back out over the gleaming landscape. \u201cYes,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough I *do* recommend changing into the long-sleeved clothes this `shuttle` has available.\u201d As Elfo spoke, the cabinet Veska had been looking through earlier opened of its own accord. \u201cFor your safety.\u201d\n\nThough they were puzzled at this request, after some small discussion they did so. Though once done, they laughed at how ridiculous they all looked.\n\nOutside, the swan-colored landscape grew closer as the flying-room soared above it, for a moment swinging over one of the bigger parts of the sea, like a bird swooping on its prey.\n\n\u201cAs well, each of you please put on one of these\u2026ear-talking things.\u201d A small cabinet opened, revealing four objects\u2014each a tiny rounded cone attached to a loop. \u201cThey will allow me to communicate with you while you are off the `ship`.\u201d\n\nWith further explanation, but they figured out that the cone went into an ear, and the loop held it in. \u201cLike this?\u201d Lena asked.\n\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d This time, Elfo\u2019s voice was there in her ear, rather than echoing in the ship. \u201cLanding in three\u2026two\u2026one\u2026\u201d\n\nA soft thump as the flying-room hit the ground, and then a scrape as the door opened, and a breeze blew inside.\n\nLena shivered.\n\nBut still walked out into the landscape, her shoes crunching on the salt-like substance beneath. And her whole body felt like\u2026\n\nThere was a time, when she was young, she got really sick\u2014even the doctor had been worried she was going to die. And she had kept shivering and shivering, and no matter how many blankets she\u2019d had or how close she\u2019d gotten to the fire, she just could *not* stop shivering.\n\nThis reminded her of that.\n\n\u201cThis is\u2026`kod`?\u201d Bakla\u2019s teeth chattered.\n\nLena knelt down to pick up the powdery stuff beneath their feet. It made her hands sting, like ointment had just been rubbed on them. The powder was kind of like salt, but\u2026not. And as she ran it between her fingers, it turned to water.\n\n\u201cThe ambient temperature is currently two `degrees Celsius` below zero. I believe you would find that `cold`, yes. What do you think of the `snow`, Lena?\u201d\n\nDespite her discomfort, she knelt back down to scoop more up. \u201c*Weird*.\u201d It was the only way she could describe it.\n\nVeska made a ball with some of the stuff and tossed it at Maltis with a laugh; soon all four of them were giggling like children as they pelted each other.\n\nThen an animal sound. \u201c*Gakigakigaki!*\u201d\n\nThey looked up to see a flock of birds walking towards them. Night-and-swan-colored birds, very similar to the one that Lena and Veska had\u2014\n\n\u201c_Gategli_!\u201d Veska exclaimed. \u201cThe one we encountered must\u2019ve gotten to our side somehow!\u201d\n\n\u201cTo *your* side?\u201d Elfo sounded puzzled. \u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have happened, unless\u2026\u201d A pause, and then a resigned voice. \u201cThe `breakdown` is happening faster than expected. My `logs` are indicating over a dozen `anomalies` in the `maintenance shafts` over the past year. This is not good, Lena.\u201d\n\nThe birds were almost upon them now, seemingly unconcerned with their presence.\n\nMaltis ran forward and grabbed a small one. \u201cElfo, what *is* this?\u201d\n\n\u201c*That* is an `emperor penguin`, one of several kinds of `penguin` that were completely killed in the `Magnacide`.\u201d\n\n\u201c_Penigwini_,\u201d Bakla recited. \u201cI like *gateg* better.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Gak*!\u201d one of the *gategli* honked as they continued marching past.\n\nVeska frowned. \u201cThey are different from the one we saw, though. Ours had a cloud-colored arc between its eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was probably a `gentoo penguin`,\u201d Elfo explained. \u201cThere are different kinds of `penguin`, as there are different kinds of hawks, skinks, or parrots.\u201d\n\nThe bird in Maltis\u2019 hands wriggled its way out and continue to walk, unconcerned.\n\n\u201cThough\u2026\u201d Veska said thoughtfully. \u201cIt\u2019s after dark on our side. And we haven\u2019t eaten in a while. I\u2019m starting to get hungry.\u201d She looked back at the flying-room. \u201cElfo, can we eat a *gateg* or two?\u201d\n\nAfter several seconds, the voice responded, \u201cIf you have the tools to do so, I see no problem with it. Or as our twenty-first `century` ancestors put it: `chow down`!\u201d\n\n---\n\nWC: 841 (849 in Scrivener), and I continue the 850 convention\n\nA reminder that things in `monospace font text` are \"twenty-first century English, General American\u201d.\n\nThe four first go up to Zhik Lenali in [Chapter 104](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1bbimpw/sersun_serial_sunday_monster/ku9tzre/).

This feature has requirements for participation!     \n\n- **Submit a story inspired by the weekly theme, written by you and set in your *self-established* universe that is 500 - 1000 words. No fanfics and no content created or altered by AI.** (Use wordcounter.net to check your wordcount.) Stories should be posted as a top-level comment below. If you\u2019re continuing an in-progress serial (not on Serial Sunday), please include links to your previous installments. \n\n- **Your chapter must be submitted by Saturday at 9:00am EST.** Late entries will be disqualified. All submissions should be given (at least) a *basic editing pass* before being posted!\n\n- **Begin your post with the name of your serial between triangle brackets** (e.g. <My Awesome Serial>). When our bot is back up and running, this will allow it to recognize your serial and add each chapter to the SerSun catalog. Do not include anything in the brackets you don\u2019t want in your title. (Please note: You must use this same title every week.)\n\n- **Do not pre-write your serial.** You\u2019re welcome to do outlining and planning for your serial, but chapters should not be pre-written. All submissions should be written for this post, specifically.\n\n- **Only one active serial per author at a time.** This does not apply to serials written outside of Serial Sunday. \n\n- **All Serial Sunday authors must leave feedback on at least one story on the thread each week.** The feedback should be **actionable** and also include something the author has done well. When you include something the author should improve on, provide an example! You have until **Saturday at 11:59pm EST** to post your feedback. (Submitting late is not an exception to this rule.)     \n\n- **Missing your feedback requirement two or more consecutive weeks will disqualify you from rankings and Campfire readings the following week.** If it becomes a habit, you may be asked to move your serial to the sub instead.\n\n- **Serials must abide by subreddit content rules.** You can view a [full list of rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/index/rules). If you\u2019re ever unsure if your story would cross the line, please modmail and ask!\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Weekly Campfires & Voting:\n\n- **On Saturdays at 1pm EST, I host a Serial Sunday Campfire in our [Discord\u2019s Voice Lounge](https://discord.gg/writingprompts).** Join us to read your story aloud, hear others, and exchange feedback.

Though with your permission, I would not only tell of the events that forced me to seek justice here today \u2013 I would also show them to all assembled here.\u201d\n\nA murmur of confusion and interest swept through the watching crowds. Platina watched as the two nobles behind Godfrey exchanged a questioning glance, while the man himself stared blankly at her like a dazed hog.\n\nSteelheart pursed her lips, her brow furrowed. \u201cIf you believe doing so shall lend clarity to your statement, by all means. Although I profess ignorance as to how such a display is possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shall see.\u201d\n\nShe exhaled, her pulse slowing and the rush of her breath calming as she concentrated. Then she inhaled, feeling her chest expand and the ever-present embers of the Flame beneath her heart quicken into blazing life, eager to be unleashed. She held her breath, bending the rising heat to her will, shaping the roiling inferno like clay beneath her claws.\n\nThen she let go, breathing out a cloud of swirling white smoke and sparks that crept over the turf, flowing like morning mist from a cold mountain peak. Platina focused, her thoughts herding the cloud to the end of the field and into the air, until it hovered just above the stands and spread out like a tapestry of ash and embers.\n\nPlatina spread her wings and drew herself up, her gaze locked on her billowing canvas. \u201cAfter the attack that left my granddaughter, Princess Aurelia, missing \u2013 and thought dead \u2013 I invited Princess Shireen to my court.\u201d She looked down at the pavilion. \u201cKing Jessail, Queen Lyrella, and I believed it to be safer than to remain in Argentum Keep, as there were no leads to the ones responsible for the foul attack.\u201d\n\nShe gestured with a claw, and the cloud reshaped itself. A small figure, outlined with sparks and trailing glowing embers like flowing locks of hair rode a dragon of smoke, its wings dragging swirls behind it as it circled towards an ash-capped mountain top that rose from the deeper mists. A chorus of excited gasps and whispered delight erupted around her as the little figures landed and disappeared inside the mountain.\n\n\u201cNot long after,\u201d she continued, drawing a new scene with a wave of her talons, \u201cAurelia returned from the dead. Delivered to us by friends I can never repay, and am eternally grateful to.\u201d \n\nThe new image showed the long-haired figure on her knees, hugging a slightly taller shape with the sharp features of a dragon, both figures blazing with warm golden light.\n\n\u201cWhile we informed King Jessail and Queen Lyrella that their lost daughter was home and hale, the decision was made that she stay with her sister in my care \u2013 in utmost secrecy. For were it to be widely known she was safe, the ones responsible for the attack upon the keep might try again.\u201d\n\nShe glanced at Godfrey, letting just a hint of smoke drift from the corner of her mouth as he met her gaze. He blanched, and quickly looked away.\n\nPlatina snorted and returned her attention to her tapestry. Her own great hall took form, the profiles of four great dragons facing four human figures. The two parties bowed to each other, before the dragons stepped aside, wings spread wide.\n\n\u201cThus, when King Jessail and Queen Lyrella came to visit \u2013 to see their daughters in the flesh, to hold their once-lost youngest in their arms \u2013 Lord Godfrey\u2019s daughter, Lady Agatha Godfrey, and his servant, Beorin, accompanied them. I extended our hospitality to them all, and swore to safeguard them as guests beneath my wing.\u201d\n\nPlatina paused, her heart thundering in her chest as she thought of the terrible night she was to tell of next. A soft wing closed around her, and she leaned into Snowdrift\u2019s side, drawing strength from his wordless warmth and love.\n\nShe drew a deep, steadying breath, then slammed her claw into the grass. The tapestry of smoke grew querulous and dark, embers flashing through it like lightning in a storm. A pale white ghost of a man stepped out of the darkness, clutching a young hatchling, its eyes and mouth wide with terror as a cruelly curved dagger was pressed against its neck.\n\nHer voice was thick with rage as she spoke. \u201cHe wanted *my child.* My firstborn, little Scintilla. Tried to steal her from her home, bind her with chains and enslave her for the rest of her days \u2013 all to claim the power over Flame my sire freely gave to the Vale hundreds of years ago!\u201d She turned to stare at Godfrey, her teeth bared. \u201cHis master and his ilk would feed on her like *leeches.* Like the Mad King before them.\u201d\n\nThe nobleman stared at the floor, his face pale. His peers were huddled closely together, both their faces hidden behind the dark fan Lady Tramil held before them, while his son sneered at the slumped form of his father with open contempt.\n\n\u201cOnly Princess Aurelia \u2013 hidden in the shadows, unseen and unheard by Beorin as he planned his escape, kept my daughter from her cruel fate.\u201d\n\nOnce again the scene within the smoke changed. Aurelia leapt from the depths of the darkened clouds and raked Beorin across his ghoulish face, her jaws closing around his knife-hand. She snatched the little dragon away and ran, disappearing into the shadowy smoke and leaving the broken man behind.\n\nPlatina raised her claw from the turf and waved it through the air. The embers within the smoke grew brighter, erupting like sparks upon sun-dried plains to consume the shape of the twisted man. Then she let go, the smoke and embers dissolving to disappear into the gentle wind.\n\n\u201cThe leech is dead,\u201d she said, her voice a cold hiss. \u201cBut its master is not.\u201d She turned to stare at Godfrey. \u201cNow I will see justice done.\u201d\n\n***\n\nBonus words used: Quicken, Querulous\n\n998 words for you this week! And a special treat with an early chapter!\n\nPlatina's display was last seen all the way back in [Chapter 41](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/uayvrn/comment/i6l45bw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), when she used it for a far more wholesome history lesson.

Great story, dude.\" Develyn clapped with a face of disinterest.\n\nBasil had all but tuned them out, instead staring at the \"Cracktus Desert\" whizzing by them on Waffelo's motorcycle, releasing streams of whipped cream from the exhaust pipes.\n\nThe \"sand,\" upon further inspection, didn't look like sand at all - it looked firm, not powdery, with various circular depressions in the ground all over, which Waffelo was keen on driving through.\n\n\"Can you-\" Basil gagged as they drove through another one. \"Can you try and dodge those?\"\n\nWaffelo chuckled as the bike quickened. \"Oh, *Monsieur Chose Rose*, the desert's devious dimples are not to be *dodged*\u2026mostly because I cannot see them until-WOAH!\" They dipped down into another one.\n\nThey noticed a few omlorks carrying eggs high in the air, going in the same direction as them\u2014towards an archway separating the strange not-sand from green grass.\n\nThe bike turned as it skidded to a stop near the entrance. Waffelo pulled Basil out of the sidecar, with Develyn and Sophocles following.\n\nThe Oasis certainly had a fitting name. Palm trees grew around buildings with flat brown walls flecked with holes and shiny white crystals. A similarly colored fort with tall spires cast a shadow over the area.\n\nMore strange eggfolk walked the streets. One's shell was thinner and burnt on the edge, while another's covered their whole face. One didn't even have a shell, just a big scrambled yolk for a head. They were walking past a pond of...\n\n\"...water?\" It took Basil a second to process that. Water\u2014that thing he had already run out of last night.\n\nHe tugged on Waffelo's chain, reaching the pond and chugging the water within. Many looked at him like\u2026well, he was a creature from another world, but he didn't care. If he wasn't cuffed, he would've probably stripped naked right there to take a bath himself.\n\n\"Wait, you *drink* that stuff?\" Develyn tilted her head.\n\n\"What kind of foolish fantasy are you living, boy?\" Waffelo tugged on the chain. \"Syrup is the only delectable drinkable that we Pekfest ingest! Whatever that clear stuff is, it tastes revolting!\"\n\nBasil shuddered, imagining the pounds he'd put on if he had their diets.\n\nThey continued their trek down the street-equivalent, apparently approaching something called \"The Incubator,\" according to a sign.\n\n\"So, you live here?\" Basil asked Develyn, his thirst finally quenched.\n\n\"Eeeyup.\" She put her hands on her head. \"Shitty, isn't it?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Look at it, dude. Everyone's just relaxing. We do nothing, and we're rewarded for it. There's, like, two people here who actually do shit, and one of them's Waffelo.\"\n\n\"...for our gift from Bon, the beautiful Amaya, has finally awoken!\" A deep, feminine voice came into earshot.\n\n\"...Aaaand there's the other one,\" Develyn said, looking up at her.\n\nShe spoke on an elevated platform holding dozens of Amaya's eggs. Her shell was a golden yellow. She wore a brown dress with a burnt, black trim, reminding Basil of buttered toast.\n\n\"If you keep her in your prayers, I'm sure she will provide eggs forevermore! Thank you.\"\n\nThe regal woman bowed, leaving the stage to light applause. Her eyes widened when she saw a particular deviled face.\n\n\"Oh, Develyn!\" The woman leaned in, hugging her, though Develyn didn't look pleased. \"Where on Scrump have you been?!\"\n\n\"Doing your job.\" Develyn crossed her arms.\n\n\"What? What do you-\"\n\n\"I believe I can explain, Your Majesty.\" Waffelo stepped forward, pushing Basil in front of her.\n\n\"This, Yolkal, is the kidnapper of your precious princess!\"\n\n\"What?!\" Basil and the eggs shouted at the same time.\n\n\"Th-That is *not* true, Miss.\" Basil tried to speak up.\n\n\"Yeah. *I* ran away.\" Develyn jumped in.\n\nYolkal sighed upon hearing her daughter's words. \"Devvy, I told you, the Syrup Swamp is no place for you. You could have gotten yourself killed.\"\n\nDevelyn snorted. \"Please. Freaking *Zubber* were out there, and I was fine-\"\n\n\"The Zubber?! In the Syrup Swamp?!\" Yolkal yelped.\n\nThe passerby stopped, staring at their queen. Whispered chatter arose among them.\n\n\"Everything's fine, my friends!\" Yolkal raised her arms. \"The princess is just\u2026making excuses.\" She said the last few words through gritted teeth, staring at her daughter.\n\nThe eggfolk sighed in relief, resuming their walking as Yolkal approached Develyn, swiping the staff right from her back.\n\n\"Hey! What are you-\"\n\n\"Doing my job.\" She shot back. \"If you won't listen to me, I'll just have to treat you like a child.\" She opened her hand. \"Give me the belt.\"\n\nDevelyn groaned, unhooking the belt holding the spice containers from her waist and placing it in her hands.\n\n\"I don't even know why he gave these to you. All they've done is put ideas in your head.\"\n\nBasil raised an eyebrow. *\"He\"?*\n\n\"Thank you for bringing her,\" she said in a calmer tone to Waffelo. \"Leave the boy with me. He's innocent.\"\n\n\"Aw, fish sticks!\" Waffelo sighed, unlocking the cuffs. \"I was sure he was at least a *little* nefarious! \n\n\"You're free to go, Sheriff. Sorry for interrupting your mission in Penge.\"\n\nWaffelo tipped his hat, and he was off. They could hear his cycle start up again in the distance.\n\n\"Come.\" Yolkal motioned Basil to follow her and Develyn. \"Tell me your name.\"\n\n\"I'm-\"\n\n\"He's Basil. The furry thing is Sophie-Cleats.\" Develyn butted in.\n\n\"Maybe let *him* speak, Develyn?\" Yolkal turned to her daughter. \"And I believe it's pronounced 'Bah-sel,' anyway.\"\n\nBasil groaned. Even in another world, he couldn't escape it.\n\n\"Pardon me for asking, sir, but\u2026\" Yokal tilted her head, analyzing Basil's body. \"What kingdom do you hail from? Not Zubber, I hope.\"\n\n\"He said he's not from here.\" Develyn butted in again. \"He and So-foul-kite are from another world.\"\n\nYolkal's eyes widened, dumbfounded, as they approached the gate to the fortress.\n\n\"That's certainly...strange.\" She eventually said as the gate opened.\n\nWC: 992/1000\n\nNotes:\n\n* Bonus words used: N/A\n* Theme - Queen: Or as the Pekfest call her, \"The Golden Egg\", Miss Yolkal Eguine, the leader of The Oasis."}, {"comment_text": "Heya Nate!\n\nAbbreviated crit during WORD OFF\n\nThe first line leading in with a \"...\" told me Waffelo  was talking for a long time already and you didn't disappoint with Develyn's reaction xD\n\nIf you wanted to take back some words to put in another funny joke you had in mind, you could probably remove Basil questioning if Waffelo knows where he's going and the omlork explanation.\n\nNice touch distinguishing water and syrup.  If Syrup is what the Pekfasts drink I wonder what the other kingdoms imbibe.\n\nThe most scathing remark on any culture I've ever seen:\n\n>There's, like, two people here who actually do shit, and one of them's Waffelo.\n\nQueen lady in charge talking to people about the recently solved problem, but did nothing about it...*sus.*\n\n*Yolkal*, nice!  Making me think of \"yokel\"\n\nI love all of Waffelo's dialogue:\n\n>I was sure he was at least a little nefarious! I mean, look at that mug of his!\n\nNot sure I'm sold on the \"bah-sel\"/\"bay-sil\" moment, since the name's being spoken and she's not seeing the word written down.  It's more likely she'd imagine it's spelled completely different.  This is another cuttable block to fit in another joke.\n\nI'm getting less sus of Yolkal the more Basil interacts with her; she's very shocked, surprised, and dumbfounded by things to be a master manipulator.  But just because she's surprised by him doesn't mean she didn't orchestrate the eggscrutiating situation from earlier.\n\nGood words!", "reply_text": "How you being, Zach the King?\n\nThanks so much, and yeah, I'll definitely remove some stuff to make room for that sweet Waffelo wordplay, heh."}, {"comment_text": "#Welcome to Serial Sunday!\n\nTo those brand new to the feature and those returning from last week, welcome!

Regardless of whether it refers to honest-to-goodness royalty, prom queens, drag queens, or anything in between, queens are usually associated with femininity, beauty, and the power that comes with both. How does your \u201cqueen\u201d react to this? Are they self-assured, confident in their femininity and strength? Do they flinch away, desperately clinging to a preconceived mask as they secretly crumble under the weight of their own or others\u2019 expectations? What does your queen and how people react to them say about the concept of feminine power in your world? What sort of role model is your \u201cqueen\u201d? Are the traits they embody considered \u201cgood\u201d? Or do they become \u201cevil\u201d when viewed from the conventions of the world?      \n\n\nOr perhaps your characters might simply take a break and play chess, cards, or suddenly start rocking out to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d. Now go have fun with it! *Blurb provided by u/wandering_cirrus.*       \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started.

Everyone knows the teams. We of course have visiting champions, the University of Nevada Las Vegas Runnin\u2019 Rebels defending their title against the home team, the University of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors,\u201d said the KHON2 sports anchor from his booth as HD cameras scanned excited fans in the stands, eager for the players to make their entrance.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Frank,\u201d said Jimmy. \u201cTwo teams with an unmatched rivalry throughout the NCAA. For UNLV, we\u2019ve got a future NFLer in Marbury Stokes who went thirteen and oh last season. By the same token, you\u2019ve got Jesse Pratt for the Warriors who has just as bright prospects, going for twelve and one last season. It\u2019ll be a thrilling matchup, to say the least.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe winner takes the revered Island Showdown Trophy,\u201d said Jimmy.\n\nCameras caught a high-def, 40K closeup of a sparkling golden pineapple mounted on a wooden base displaying a Las Vegas-themed plaque, twirling in a protective glass case.\n\n\u201cYou know, the Brits and the Australians have a similar rivalry with cricket called the Ashes,\u201d said Frank.\n\n\u201cBut who watches cricket?\u201d laughed Jimmy.\n\n\u201cAnd who wants an urn of smelly ashes?\u201d agreed Frank.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that could come between these two teams is a freak of nature. No, I\u2019m not talking about six-foot-seven, three-hundred pound UNLV linebacker Kiki Stewart. I\u2019m talking about lava, Frank,\u201d said Jimmy.\n\n\u201cThe lava flow is getting awfully close,\u201d said Frank. \u201cLet\u2019s send it to Virginia Collins who\u2019s following the flow. Virginia?\u201d\n\nThe camera cut to a big-haired blonde woman standing in the middle of a deserted roadway. In the background, quaint municipal support vehicles with orange strobing lights blocked off the entrance and exit to the areas. Official-looking people in uniforms milled about as if they had been there for hours already.\n\n\u201cThanks Frank,\u201d Virginia said. \u201cFootball fans probably aren\u2019t paying too much attention to this, but a few hundred feet from Aloha Stadium is snaking a slow but steady stream of red-hot lava. There is no reason to be worried, according to the Governor who had this to say before she went into the stadium herself only moments ago,\u201d said Virginia.\n\nThe broadcast cut to a shot of Governor Holcomb and Kimo entering Gate 2. A microphone and camera were thrust into their faces, but Evelyn continued walking. \u201cWe\u2019re here to join the game, that\u2019s all,\u201d she said.\n\nCutting back to Virginia: \u201cNot many words from the Governor there, Frank. And we\u2019ve just been told that the Governor has fired Oahu\u2019s Director of Emergency Management, so we are trusting the Governor has everything handled. Back to you boys at Aloha.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks Virginia,\u201d Jimmy said. \u201cCan\u2019t they just reroute the stream of lava so that it goes into the ocean, Frank?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho cares, Jimmy? All I\u2019m wondering is if Coach Hall and Jesse Pratt can pick the right routes to defeat the Rebels today.\u201d\n\nWith that, an announcer said, \u201cIntroducing your University of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors!\u201d\n\nThe crowd went wild and a smoke machine belched out white clouds and confetti in front of an entrance tunnel. The announcer listed off the players in order of least important to most important. The last player out of the tunnel was the back-up quarterback. The smoke machine stopped, and the rival team arrived onto the field. A small din erupted amongst fans and commentators alike.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re seeing this, Jimmy,\u201d said Frank, \u201cBut I think they missed Jesse Pratt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, Frank,\u201d Jimmy said. \u201cI think you\u2019re right. Where the heck *is* Pratt?\u201d"}, {"comment_text": "Howdy Max!\n\nAbbreviated feedback during WORD OFF\n\nAbsolutely adore the announcer-talk starting this chapter off.  Really sets up the feeling that everything's about to go down.\n\nMinor suggestion; consider italicizing the team names to help differentiate them from the university names.  Not sure if there's a standard or not, just a thought from my own reading.\n\nThis got a good chuckle out of me:\n\n>\u201cBut who watches cricket?\u201d laughed Jimmy.\r  \n>  \n>\u201cAnd who wants an urn of smelly ashes?\u201d agreed Frank.\n\nI like how many times Virginia says \"the Governor\"; really going to hammer home all of the mistake's Evelyn's made this week when it all goes to hell.\n\nAnd finally Jesse's absence is noted by someone.  I was expecting a chapter going over the coach and team freaking out tbh. \n\nThe lava flow feels like a ticking clock over everything else going on.  I can't wait to see exactly how many different blazes of glory are going to go off soon.\n\nGood words!", "reply_text": "Thanks!\n\nJust after I posted I was thinking that I could zoom in on the coach and have him freaking out... there definitely is a lot of off-screen drama. I guess I don't see a role for the coach in the whole scheme of the plot, it would just be flavour.\n\nHe is not as degenerate as all the other characters, so I guess not worth following.\n\n  \nEdit: Also, I could probably google it, but I am totally in the dark about Word Off...I am guessing some sort of writing competition like NaNoWriMo but on Reddit?"}, {"comment_text": "#Welcome to Serial Sunday!\n\nTo those brand new to the feature and those returning from last week, welcome!

Regardless of whether it refers to honest-to-goodness royalty, prom queens, drag queens, or anything in between, queens are usually associated with femininity, beauty, and the power that comes with both. How does your \u201cqueen\u201d react to this? Are they self-assured, confident in their femininity and strength? Do they flinch away, desperately clinging to a preconceived mask as they secretly crumble under the weight of their own or others\u2019 expectations? What does your queen and how people react to them say about the concept of feminine power in your world? What sort of role model is your \u201cqueen\u201d? Are the traits they embody considered \u201cgood\u201d? Or do they become \u201cevil\u201d when viewed from the conventions of the world?      \n\n\nOr perhaps your characters might simply take a break and play chess, cards, or suddenly start rocking out to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d. Now go have fun with it! *Blurb provided by u/wandering_cirrus.*       \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n- April 7 - Queen (this week)         \n- April 14 - Recovery    \n- April 21 - Struggle    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Perception](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/sersun_serial_sunday_perception/)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxnkgi4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel             \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/ky3fbhu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/OldBayJ         \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxoz94k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing            \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxt32uq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/AGuyLikeThat                \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/ky3o035/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/Zetakh                          \n         \n\n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below.

A second head, chest, and pair of arms emerge beside Fye. It crawls forward on its pale hands, its legs pulling themselves out of Fye\u2019s body, black goop trailing behind it. It has the same figure as Fye, and even the same two blades. It\u2019s easy to mistake the two as twins. \r  \n\r  \n*A clone?*\r  \n\r  \nWithin a blink, the clone throws one of the blades at Linda. She quickly blocks it with her own, blasting a beam of golden light toward the imposter. The newcomer moves to the side before charging towards the queen. \r  \n\r  \nAlex steps forward, about to help, when he feels something slice his side.\r  \n\r  \n*Fuck!* He cusses at his own absentmindedness. \r  \n\r  \nHe quickly turns, seeing the real king in front of him, blade at his neck, when his body suddenly freezes. Taking the opportunity, Alex moves away, holding onto his bleeding side. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo, fight me!\u201d Evan shouts, taking a step towards Fye. Evan's eyes change color, just like the time the hypnotist made those guards freeze. Only this time, he isn\u2019t using words. \r  \n\r  \nThe king's eyes turn to Alex. Just seeing that emotionless gaze sends shivers down the demon\u2019s spine. Fye\u2019s arms slowly begin moving, trying to break free from the spell. \r  \n\r  \nThe clanging sound of swords draws Alex's attention towards the Queen. \r  \n\r  \n*Should I leave Evan here with Fye? But he might get himself killed. And what about Linda? Can she handle this clone?* \r  \n\r  \nFye\u2019s fingers twitch. Alex's chances are running slim. He turns back to Fye, running towards him. Hoping that luck is on his side, he swings his sword towards Fye\u2019s neck. \r  \n\r  \n*THUMP! CLINK!* \r  \n\r  \nLike the speed of lightning, Evan drops to the ground. Fye\u2019s dual blades are now touching Alex\u2019s. The little chance Alex had been granted is now washed away, and Fye has the advantage. The king knees him in the chin before kicking him in the chest, knocking the wind out of him. \r  \n\r  \nAlex stumbles back, his ears ringing, his breath coming in short pants. He glances around, seeing a weak Evan trying to get up and Linda and the clone still battling it out. Alex coughs violently, blood dripping onto the ground. \r  \n\r  \n*I can\u2019t\u2026not now\u2026*\r  \n\r  \nHeavy footsteps approach. He turns, seeing Fye walking towards him with a mocking grin. He turns his blade tip so Alex can see it. At this moment, he\u2019s the target. Alex glances at Evan, who is slowly getting up, but the hypnotist\u2019s legs are shaking. He also looks paler than usual. It is clear that even he is at his limit. \r  \n\r  \nAlex's legs finally give in. He kneels down, sweat, blood, and tears all sucked into the clouds. \r  \n\r  \n*It is like the first fight, nothing has improved.*\r  \n\r  \nIt won\u2019t be long until Alex can\u2019t avoid death anymore. \r  \n\r  \n*No, I don\u2019t want to die\u2026*\r  \n\r  \nAs if to grant his wish, a sword flies in Fye's direction, hitting him in the shoulder. A howl escapes the king's lips as he takes a couple steps back.\r  \n\r  \nHe notices Linda, who\u2019s breathing heavily, lower her arms. She runs towards Alex, helping him up. She then grabs him by the wrist before running to Evan. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cBoth of you, get it together!\u201d she shouts. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cBut Linda, he\u2019s too strong. He even managed to break away from my hypnotism twice now.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAlex takes this time to catch his breath and fight through the pain. He grits his teeth, hoping that this fight will end. \r  \n\r  \nLinda turns to him. \u201cAlex. I know you have that power still. I want you to use it.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nAlex's eyes widen. Just thinking about using it again makes his stomach twist. The last time he used it on someone, he got them killed. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou have to trust me.\u201d The queen holds his hand. She stares at him deeply, her eyes softening like a mother\u2019s. \u201cIf we want to knock some sense into Fye, we need to do this. This is our only chance to help him.\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cIs this really the way? Using fear? Does it really help people open up?\u201d Alex\u2019s fist tightens, remembering Edom's frightened expression. \u201cOr does it make them shut down their feelings more?\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\u201cLook, it\u2019s either him or us. If you want Fye to redeem himself, make him realize that he isn\u2019t a god. Make him fear you.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nAlex can tell by Linda's eyes. She is not going to take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer. He turns to Evan, who gives him a nod. \r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou have me also to back you up. You\u2019re not alone.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nAlex turns back to Linda, taking a deep breath before closing his eyes. He lets his emotions bubble up together. Hatred, disgust, fear. \r  \n\r  \n*\u201cI knew you needed me.\u201d*\r  \n\r  \nA smirk appears on his face.

Please be sure to read the entire post for a full list of rules.\n***\n#This Week\u2019s Theme is Queen!       \n\n[**Image**](https://www.deviantart.com/cvanilda/art/A-bow-for-Scarlet-872508655)  | [**Song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqBKrJnA8ZY)            \n    \n**Bonus Word List** (each included word is worth 5 pts) - **Please list which words you included at the end of your story.**                  \n- querulous                                \n- quaint                                                                                                   \n- quintessence                                                                                                                      \n- quickened         \n                                          \n         \nOriginally just meaning a woman monarch (often due to their marriage with a king), \u201cqueen\u201d has grown over the years to accumulate many different shades of meaning. Regardless of whether it refers to honest-to-goodness royalty, prom queens, drag queens, or anything in between, queens are usually associated with femininity, beauty, and the power that comes with both. How does your \u201cqueen\u201d react to this? Are they self-assured, confident in their femininity and strength? Do they flinch away, desperately clinging to a preconceived mask as they secretly crumble under the weight of their own or others\u2019 expectations? What does your queen and how people react to them say about the concept of feminine power in your world? What sort of role model is your \u201cqueen\u201d? Are the traits they embody considered \u201cgood\u201d? Or do they become \u201cevil\u201d when viewed from the conventions of the world?      \n\n\nOr perhaps your characters might simply take a break and play chess, cards, or suddenly start rocking out to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d. Now go have fun with it! *Blurb provided by u/wandering_cirrus.*       \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n- April 7 - Queen (this week)         \n- April 14 - Recovery    \n- April 21 - Struggle    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Perception](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/sersun_serial_sunday_perception/)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxnkgi4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel             \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/ky3fbhu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/OldBayJ         \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxoz94k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing            \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxt32uq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/AGuyLikeThat                \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/ky3o035/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/Zetakh                          \n         \n\n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below. This feature has requirements for participation!     \n\n- **Submit a story inspired by the weekly theme, written by you and set in your *self-established* universe that is 500 - 1000 words. No fanfics and no content created or altered by AI.** (Use wordcounter.net to check your wordcount.) Stories should be posted as a top-level comment below. If you\u2019re continuing an in-progress serial (not on Serial Sunday), please include links to your previous installments. \n\n- **Your chapter must be submitted by Saturday at 9:00am EST.** Late entries will be disqualified. All submissions should be given (at least) a *basic editing pass* before being posted!\n\n- **Begin your post with the name of your serial between triangle brackets** (e.g. <My Awesome Serial>). When our bot is back up and running, this will allow it to recognize your serial and add each chapter to the SerSun catalog. Do not include anything in the brackets you don\u2019t want in your title. (Please note: You must use this same title every week.)\n\n- **Do not pre-write your serial.** You\u2019re welcome to do outlining and planning for your serial, but chapters should not be pre-written. All submissions should be written for this post, specifically.\n\n- **Only one active serial per author at a time.** This does not apply to serials written outside of Serial Sunday. \n\n- **All Serial Sunday authors must leave feedback on at least one story on the thread each week.** The feedback should be **actionable** and also include something the author has done well. When you include something the author should improve on, provide an example! You have until **Saturday at 11:59pm EST** to post your feedback. (Submitting late is not an exception to this rule.)     \n\n- **Missing your feedback requirement two or more consecutive weeks will disqualify you from rankings and Campfire readings the following week.** If it becomes a habit, you may be asked to move your serial to the sub instead.\n\n- **Serials must abide by subreddit content rules.** You can view a [full list of rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/index/rules). If you\u2019re ever unsure if your story would cross the line, please modmail and ask!\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Weekly Campfires & Voting:\n\n- **On Saturdays at 1pm EST, I host a Serial Sunday Campfire in our [Discord\u2019s Voice Lounge](https://discord.gg/writingprompts).** Join us to read your story aloud, hear others, and exchange feedback.

A visitor\u2014an unauthorized one, at that. One who had slipped through Lillias's wards\u2014not entirely unnoticed\u2014and was now in the process of fiddling with the door to my room.\n\nInstructions from a time long past raced through my mind.\n\n*Hide.*\n\nMy closet, deep and dark, would suffice. I would watch. And I would wait.\n\n*Identify.*\n\nWho was this intruder? They were short and slender, their movements lithe. Her quaint little broomstick, as well as her large, brash, and garish witch's hat, designated her as the quintessence of Western witchcraft \u2014 a mortal one at that, unlike the archmage.\n\n*And if necessary...*\n\nThe color of her soul was still shadowed to me. I'd have to do this the hard way.\n\n*Eliminate.*\n\nI burst forth from the closet, my right hand clutching around the witch's throat before slamming her into the wall.\n\n\"Ghhhk\u2026!\" She clawed at my hands, and I released my grip ever so slightly.\n\n\"Who are you, and why have you come?\" My voice was a hiss. \"Do not lie.\"\n\n\"T-treasure!\" the witch yelped. \"Lili's biggest, most complex ward! Had to be a big deal, yeah?!\" Her fragmented speech came in between quickened, panicked breaths.\n\nA fool, then. A single glance into her passionately pure eyes, devoid of any meaningful substance, confirmed it.\n\n\"What to do with you...\" I murmured, flexing my fingers around her throat.\n\n\"Please don't kill me!\" she squeaked, her eyes wide and brimming with tears. \"I-I wasn't gonna take nothing, yeah? Just a peek, yeah?!\"\n\n\"You're a fool, girl.\" A smile crept onto my face. A new face meant a new color, a new soul, a new puzzle to analyze. \"You should have thought things through, *yeah*?\"\n\nA slight blush crept onto the querulous witch's face even as her eyes bulged. \"H-hey! That's my thing, yeah?!\"\n\nThe audacity. I snorted in laughter. \"Heh. Well, I'm the 'treasure' you were looking for. Satisfied?\"\n\n\"Y-yeah! Yeah, very much satisfied, yeah!\" Her eyes, still burning with that foolish passion, roved over me. \"You *are* kinda pretty, I guess, yeah. Not sure why you're her treasure, though. You her wife, yeah?\"\n\nI couldn't help but laugh. A full, rich laugh, my head thrown back and my body shaking. She knew *nothing*. Nothing about me, about Cyprus, about Lillias. And it was so *refreshing*.\n\nI released the witch, stepping back, still chuckling. \"What is your name, hm? Or shall I simply call you witch?\"\n\n\"Me?\" She blinked, before assuming a well-practiced pose, her hand on her chest. \"I am the Mistress of Light, the Scion of the Sun, the Lustrous Queen, the Ultimate Mage! I am... Merry Laveau, Witch Extraordinaire, yeah!\"\n\n\"Charmed,\" I replied dryly. All that pomp for a mortal mage, huh?\n\n\"H-hey! Don't look down on me! I'll have you know, I'm the most powerful witch alive, yeah!\" Another pose, her hand raised in a finger gun. \"I'm even stronger than Lili, yeah!\"\n\nI squinted. That wasn't a lie, per se. She believed it. The truth, however, was another matter entirely.\n\n\"Oh?\" I said, my voice dripping with disdain. \"Is that so?\"\n\n\"Yeah!\" she declared, puffing her chest out. Didn't you see me break through those wards like nothing? Swift, silent, and deadly, yeah! Lili's got nothing on me! No one does, yeah!\"\n\nHer eyes, so earnest and confident, met mine. Of course, what she didn't realize was that the silent alarm, which I had felt her trigger, had brought the archmage rushing down the halls, her boots ringing out a frantic staccato.\n\nOnce more, the poor door was blasted off its hinges. The archmage stood, her face red and her body trembling, the flames burning in her palms once more.\n\n\"Haema\u2014MERRY?!\" Lillias's expression shifted from determination to shock to white-hot anger. Her fireball grew larger and brighter as her fury intensified.\n\n\"O-oh, hey, Lili,\" Merry laughed nervously, her eyes darting to and fro. \"Fancy seeing you here, yeah?\"\n\n\"Don't give me that, you little brat,\" the archmage growled, stepping forward. \"I have a job! Responsibilities! None of which involve tracking down *petty thieves*!\"\n\n\"I-I'm not a thief! Just a, uh... a friend. Yeah, a friend!\" Merry smiled sheepishly, rubbing the back of her neck. \"Just borrowing, y-yeah!\"\n\n\"Silence.\" With a wave of her hand, a magical sphere of deafening silence enveloped the witch. Her mouth continued to move, oblivious to her words being utterly lost.\n\n\"Haema,\" Lillias spoke, an utterly drained expression on her face. \"Don't make trouble while I deal with her. Please.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have no need to worry, dear Lillias.\" I sat back down on one of my chairs, smiling sweetly. \"I fully intend on enjoying the sight of you wrangling our unexpected visitor.\"\n\n\"Ugh.\" \n\nI watched as the archmage struggled to haul the thrashing witch out the door. I was certain that Lillias could have been far less tolerant, as she had done far worse to others in the past. But Merry had, despite her bluster, gotten through the archmage's wards.\n\nPerhaps Lillias recognized some sort of potential in her. Or perhaps the witch had simply reminded her of her own youthful foolishness so long ago.\n\nThere was no way for me to know, even as I poured myself a cup of tea. But, as I sat, pondering the colors and contours of the witch's soul, a smile graced my lips.\n\nIt was a beautiful color, that bright blossom of passion.\n\n\n***\n\nWC: 892/1000  \nBonus Words: querulous, quaint, quintessence, quickened\nr/EnigmaofMaishulLothli\n\n[<= Previous Chapter](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxmk4ps/) / [Next Chapter =>]()\n\n[Chapter Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/EnigmaOfMaishulLothli/comments/1biad6c/out_of_kindness/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"}, {"comment_text": "Heya Lothli-esque Maishul!\n\nAbbreviated crit during WORD OFF\n\nI wonder who would dare intrude in this house.  Who could get past Lillias's wards and if \"not entirely unnoticed\" referred to Lillias or Haema noticing the magic work.\n\nLove the quintessential western witch description.  Fascinating that this is the first person we encounter who can hide their soul, despite Haema being surrounded by people with powerful magic who ostensibly know her abilities, and her existence being otherwise kept secret.\n\n\"Lili\", this witch knows Lilias, a wonderfully simple way to introduce the fact.\n\nI hope the witch can survive this *burn*:\n\n>A fool, then. A single glance into her passionately pure eyes, devoid of any meaningful substance, confirmed it.\n\nNice touch having Haema mimic the verbal tic.  Love all of Merry's titles.  Can't blame her, she's clearly strong enough to get through Lili's wards which seems to be something notable.\n\nHonestly wasn't expecting Lilias to appear, I'm so glad she did though.  The interaction was very tense at first, I wasn't sure what was going to happen or break.  I really hope we see more of her!  Seems like the perfect wrench in the gears to tip the balance in the house.\n\nGood words!", "reply_text": "Hallo, 2ach!\n\nI'm glad the little veils Haema pulled throughout this chapter caught your eye.

I recommend a different word.\n\n>designated her as the quintessence of Western witchcraft \u2014 a mortal one at that, unlike the archmage.\n\nInteresting! So we've got a more familiar-looking witch as opposed to the unique mages that lead. Though, how does she know this woman is mortal? So far, every magical creature we've seen has shown at least implications of immortality.\n\n>my right hand clutching around the witch's throat\n\n>\"Who are you, and why have you come?\"\n\nYou don't clutch someone's throat if you want them to talk - that actually makes them unable to talk. I understand this is just a quick motion from Haema without much thought but it always bugs me when people do this - wanting to get information out of somebody while simultaneously making them unable to give it audibly.\n\n>\"You should have thought things through, *yeah*?\"\n\n>A slight blush crept onto the querulous witch's face even as her eyes bulged. \"H-hey!

Very minor, though.\n\n>\"I am the Mistress of Light, the Scion of the Sun, the Lustrous Queen, the Ultimate Mage! I am... Merry Laveau, Witch Extraordinaire, yeah!\"\n\nMinor, why is she hesitating before saying her name, unless it's just a dramatic build up, which, fair, she seems like the type to do some like that. \n\n>\"Haema\u2014MERRY?!\" Her expression shifted\n\nI cannot tell who is talking here. Had to go back and reread the paragraph after I was sure it was Lili.\n\nLoved this chapter! Merry seems like such a fun character, she might actually be my favorite! (sorry, Kalli) Maybe it's not what you're going for, but I get a \"little girl with a big imagination\" vibe from her. She's got such an innocent attitude that bounces off murder-and-manipulation-machine Haema in such a fun way. \n\nShe actually reminds me a lot of Waffelo from my serial, especially with the line \"the Scion of the Sun\", a very nice alliteration, though, instead of a mortal witch, Waffelo is...well, Waffelo.\n\nGood words!", "reply_text": "Hallo, Nate-o!\n\n> her large, brash, and loud witch's hat\n\nThe word has been replaced.

A strong imagination could always overcome the absence of a real companion, and Betsy made wonderful company, or at least she tried to make believe so; she had no choice. Mother Nature had decided there was something much more for her\u2014to be a golden child\u2014but all she felt was the isolation of the apartment and the stress it was causing her parents. Was it all her fault? Had she done something wrong? She was way too young to comprehend any of it. &nbsp;\n\nShe gazed out her bedroom window at the grey sky overlooking city rooftops and snowy streets below. It was a wild and mysterious world for her. Countless people were briskly walking the streets, all seemingly with somewhere important to be. An endless stream of cars and trucks were passing by and disappearing forever. An unfamiliar world in motion. She noticed an outdoor ice skating rink open in the park where children were circling freely in a joyful and perpetual motion. &nbsp;\n\n\"See that, Betsy? See those people down there?\" She pointed towards the ice skating rink. &nbsp;\n\n\"Maybe if we ask nicely, mum will let us go ice skating... Maybe...\" She still had some optimism left in reserve. &nbsp;\n\nShe and Betsy wandered down the hall together to find her mother. They found her sitting quietly in an armchair using her phone, however, something didn't seem right about Lucia. She was just... impassive and disconnected. She hadn't been her usual self lately, not the lively, vibrant character Claire had grown up with. &nbsp;\n\nClaire's obedience fell to her natural instincts, and she began moving her tiny hands around her mother in a gentle and fluent motion where she couldn't be seen. Her hands shimmered with a blue energy field as she began to absorb her mother's aura. *Gasp* She stumbled backward. Her mountain of anxiety struck Claire with force; it was more than any five year old child should have to fathom. She trembled and tried her best to hold back tears. &nbsp;\n\nLucia noticed Claire standing behind her. \"Uncle Charlie is coming to pick us up soon, quick, go put your coat on.\" Without being querulous, she went and put on her pink coat, endeavoring to lift her mother's spirits with good behavior. &nbsp;\n\nThe animated world, almost within reach but only from the backseat of a car, passed by like a motion film, filled with such awe and wonder. But she could only sit back and watch it all pass by, a bound spirit, a soul contained. &nbsp;\n\n\"We had a close call at the park, professor, she... started doing her hand movements while we had company.\" Lucia told Charlie. &nbsp;\n\n\"Her energy sensing hand movements?\" Charlie asked. &nbsp;\n\n\"Yes, thankfully they were distracted enough not to notice, but we've kept her isolated since. I don't know how else to manage her powers.\" &nbsp;\n\n\"We need to be super vigilant, Lucia, she's a special child and needs extra love and support.\" &nbsp;\n\nClaire observed the conversation from the backseat. She thought how strange it was when adults spoke openly like she wasn't there or couldn't comprehend anything they were discussing. &nbsp;\n\nUpon reaching Charlie's apartment building,  their pace quickened as she was ushered up the lift and into his apartment. The clutter and endless array of books had become a familiar sight. Wood paneling and bookcases gave the environment a quaint and cosy feel, the quintessence of a perfect study. She noticed something she hadn't seen before, a framed black and white photo of an unfamiliar woman. At that moment Charlie got her attention. &nbsp;\n \n\"Okay Claire, I have something to tell you!\" &nbsp;\n\n\"What is it, Uncle Charlie?\" &nbsp;\n\nCharlie crouched down. \"Do you know how mummy and daddy won't let you do your special magic? Well, guess what... Here I make the rules and you can do all the magic you want.\" &nbsp;\n\nClaire looked at her mother for her confirmation. She simply gave a nod of approval. &nbsp;\n\n\"How does that sound, Claire? Do you want to show more of your special powers?\" &nbsp;\n\nWith a slight hesitation, Claire simply nodded in response. &nbsp;\n\n\"Right, how about I sit down on the rug so we can practice?\" He sat cross-legged on the floor in front of her. &nbsp;\n\nClaire closed her eyes tightly, reached out her right hand, and concentrated as hard as she could. Within seconds her hand began to spark and pulsate a blue electrical energy field, causing tremors and wind to blow through the apartment. Charlie sat still, determined to follow through despite feelings of unease. The energy field began to split and fracture, then surround Charlie. Books were flying around the apartment and items were smashing to the floor. &nbsp;\n\nThe last thing Claire heard was her mother yelling, \"Are you okay?\" before everything fell silent. Surrounding her was a beautiful garden, full of vibrant flowers and golden rays of sunshine passing through the trees. Birds could be heard singing in the treetops. The environment felt alive, speaking peace and harmony to her; it was the escape she had yearned for. &nbsp;\n\nA woman appeared from behind the trees and wandered down to meet her. Claire quickly recognised her as the woman in the photo in Charlie's apartment. &nbsp;\n\n\"Hi there little one, I'm Ruby, how did you get here? Who are you?\" &nbsp;\n\n\"My name's Claire, I came from Uncle Charlie.\" &nbsp;\n\n\"Charlie? Charlie Eikenberry?\" &nbsp;\n\n\"Yes.\" &nbsp;\n\nRuby fell to her knees, overcome with emotion, she struggled to find the words. \"If you go back... tell him I love him with all my heart... Please...\" &nbsp;\n\n\"Okay, I will.\" &nbsp; \n\nIn the flash of an instant, Claire was back in Charlie's apartment again. He was still sitting on the floor, looking overwhelmed and catching his breath. &nbsp;\n\n\"Ruby is with you, her spirit lives inside you. She loves you with all her heart.\" &nbsp;\n\nCharlie stared at the floor, then covered his face and slowly began weeping. \"My dear queen Ruby, I miss you so much. I love you so much.\"\n***\nWC:998 Bonus Words: Querulous, Quaint, Quintessence, Quickened [[Previous Chapter]] (https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/sersun_serial_sunday_perception/ky8kloy/)"}, {"comment_text": "#Welcome to Serial Sunday!\n\nTo those brand new to the feature and those returning from last week, welcome!

Regardless of whether it refers to honest-to-goodness royalty, prom queens, drag queens, or anything in between, queens are usually associated with femininity, beauty, and the power that comes with both. How does your \u201cqueen\u201d react to this? Are they self-assured, confident in their femininity and strength? Do they flinch away, desperately clinging to a preconceived mask as they secretly crumble under the weight of their own or others\u2019 expectations? What does your queen and how people react to them say about the concept of feminine power in your world? What sort of role model is your \u201cqueen\u201d? Are the traits they embody considered \u201cgood\u201d? Or do they become \u201cevil\u201d when viewed from the conventions of the world?      \n\n\nOr perhaps your characters might simply take a break and play chess, cards, or suddenly start rocking out to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d.

His toes scuff the wooden floorboards. Cerulean radiance spills from his eyes as his head tips back, illuminating the hall\u2019s cobwebbed ceiling.\n\nPetal and Moskoto move together. The older warrior takes the right arm of their prisoner while Akari Pe\u2019etelan grabs his left. They hold him steady as the Warden relinquishes his grip. The villager goes limp in their hands, his head lolls to the side, and his lambent eyes grow dim. \n\nThe Warden takes a step back, then brings his palms to either side of the villager\u2019s head. The man stares at the ground and voices a long moan.\n\nDark swirls of energy ripple from the Warden\u2019s hands, expanding and shifting as they wind around his prisoner\u2019s shoulders and encompass his torso. \n\n\u201cReveal yourself!\n\nHis mouth hangs open beneath hollow cheeks as his groaning rises to a shout, then ceases altogether. The light in his eyes burns low and steady as Beranen lifts his head.\n\nPetal feels a change in his stance and braces herself, in case he tries to pull away or wrestle. But instead, he transfers his weight back onto his feet and brings his gaze level with the Warden\u2019s.\n\n\u201cFoolish warden!\u201d The voice is deep and sonorous, resonating in the ether. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to leave this place.\u201d Petal recognises the voice from the half-moon ceremony. \n\n*The Chamberlain.*\n\nBeranen\u2019s eyes are pools of glimmering blue, shining with the Chamberlain\u2019s sorcerous quintessence.  He looks left and right at his captors. \u201cWhy do you follow this man? He leads you only toward death! Do you think this is the first time he has-\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence.\u201d The coils of thick shadow pulse and tighten around the villager\u2019s chest, cutting off his impertinence. A thick tendril winds around the man\u2019s throat and flattens across his mouth.\n\nThe Warden releases his grip and Petal catches Beranen\u2019s weight as he stumbles back.\n\n\u201cTake him to the cells.\u201d Moskoto nods, and Petal helps drag the shadow-bound prisoner to the exit of the hall.\n\nA small crowd of villagers have gathered outside. Drawn by the scent of baking bread, but warned by Beranen\u2019s screams, they mill about uncertainly. Families with sunken cheeks and desperate hunger in their eyes.\n\nThe sun breaks through the clouds as they push their captive across the threshold. Akari Pe\u2019etelan blinks in the sudden brightness.\n\n\u201cOver there,\u201d Moskoto nods to a tall building with a quaint red door and barred windows across the street.\n\nA hush descends as the villagers stare up at the massive Buchakali warrior, her white-haired companion, and their prisoner.\n\n\u201cWhat are they doing to Beranen?\u201d somebody whispers, breaking the silence.\n\nThe Warden pushes past, glaring at the ill-timed gathering.\n\nA vertiginous tide draws every eye in the crowd to the tall, dark man. He stares back, defiant and commanding.  \n\n\u201cMy friends,\u201d he points at Beranen. \u201cThe Chamberlain has turned this man into a hollow puppet. I intend to free him.\u201d\n\nMurmurs and whispers answer him. \n\n\u201cWe will release all of you from the Chamberlain\u2019s tyranny!\u201d The Warden clenches his hand into a fist.\n\nSamal steps from the doorway. \u201cI told them there was food\u2026\u201d His voice is quiet.\n\n\u201cThere is bread and more waiting within. Can you not smell it?\u201d The Warden pauses. From the back of the crowd, some begin to jostle forward. \u201cI promise you, there is enough for all.\u201d A soft murmur runs through the gathering. \u201cLet us pass, and you may eat your fill.\u201d\n\nA searing jolt of pain bursts through Petal\u2019s arms. With sudden strength, Beranen twists from her grip. The shadowy bindings fall away as he writhes free and pushes forward.\n\n\u201cYou cannot trust this man!\u201d He shouts to the crowd. \u201cThese hardships are but a fleeting distraction before the glory to come.\u201d\n\nThey recoil, one and all, before this madness. Parents shield their children - some few step forward as though ready to fight. Whatever sorcery held these people in thrall last night, enraptured by the words of a phantom has been dispelled. Now, Pe\u2019etelan sees only fear and horror on their faces.\n\n\u201cFools! Without me, this world is doomed!\u201d He spins to face the Warden, who is bearing towards him with his arms shrouded by darkness. \u201cYour interference is unfortunate, but altogether too late. Soon, my queen will arise! Then, you *will* see the truth of your folly!\u201d\n\nBeranen\u2019s eyes glow like burning sapphires. The glow intensifies until it radiates through his flesh and fills his gaping mouth. Cobalt flames lick the sallow skin of his neck and shoulders. He lifts hands wreathed in swirling azure mist that coalesces into a shining sphere that he thrusts forward.\n\nThe Warden leaps to one side, as a torrent of blue fire crackles against the stone door-frame.\n\nAkari Pe\u2019etelan moves quickly, slipping behind the possessed man, touching Moskoto as she passes - letting him know to follow her lead. \n\nHer body is weak from her quickened healing, but she will have strength enough.\n\nPetal dives low, depending on her larger mass, and strikes the back of the sorcerous puppet\u2019s knees. She drives him forward, disrupting his foul sorcery. \n\nMoskoto leaps over her as she rolls away. He wraps his arms around the struggling man\u2019s neck. Ignoring the foxfire flames, he pulls hard until his opponent\u2019s back arches. \n\nThe possessed villager gives a strangled gasp and claws at the rebel\u2019s forearm. Slowly, the light inside his skull grows dim.\n\nBeranen struggles weakly as the Warden grabs hold and his dark power wraps around him. The black coils are thicker this time.\n\nWhispers and murmurs ripple through the crowd as they move hastily aside. \n\nPetal and Moskoto drag their prisoner forward, his feet trailing in the dust. The Warden stalks behind, a storm on his brow. \n\nAkari Pe'etelan looks around as they walk through the crowd, and it is hard to say who the villagers fear more. \n____\n\n^^**WC-997**\n\n*Author's Notes:*\n\n- *This week's theme is Queen! - Akari Pe'etelan is a queen in her own mind, but the Chamberlain respects the majesty of another...*\n- *Petal is focusing on healing the grievous wound she received in [Ch36](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1aiz6sl/sersun_serial_sunday_hidden/kpqp28x/). I had hoped to include an epigraph about Buchakali powers, but not enough room this week!*\n- *I'm not sure if the Warden has openly used his Talent much during the narrative, but there are plenty of hints about his shadow powers. I'll edit this note if I can find a good reference.*\n- *Bonus words used; querulous, quaint, quintessence, quickened.*\n\n\n[Bonus Image!](https://imgur.com/99n9woz)\n\n____\n\nThanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed this chapter.

Do you have a self-established universe you\u2019ve been writing or planning to write in? Do you have an idea for a world that\u2019s been itching to get out? This is the perfect place to explore that. Each week, I post a theme to inspire you, along with a related image and song. You have 500 - 1000 words to write your installment. You can jump in at any time; writing for previous weeks\u2019 is not necessary in order to join. After you\u2019ve posted, come back and provide feedback for at least 1 other writer on the thread. Please be sure to read the entire post for a full list of rules.\n***\n#This Week\u2019s Theme is Queen!       \n\n[**Image**](https://www.deviantart.com/cvanilda/art/A-bow-for-Scarlet-872508655)  | [**Song**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqBKrJnA8ZY)            \n    \n**Bonus Word List** (each included word is worth 5 pts) - **Please list which words you included at the end of your story.**                  \n- querulous                                \n- quaint                                                                                                   \n- quintessence                                                                                                                      \n- quickened         \n                                          \n         \nOriginally just meaning a woman monarch (often due to their marriage with a king), \u201cqueen\u201d has grown over the years to accumulate many different shades of meaning. Regardless of whether it refers to honest-to-goodness royalty, prom queens, drag queens, or anything in between, queens are usually associated with femininity, beauty, and the power that comes with both. How does your \u201cqueen\u201d react to this? Are they self-assured, confident in their femininity and strength? Do they flinch away, desperately clinging to a preconceived mask as they secretly crumble under the weight of their own or others\u2019 expectations? What does your queen and how people react to them say about the concept of feminine power in your world? What sort of role model is your \u201cqueen\u201d? Are the traits they embody considered \u201cgood\u201d? Or do they become \u201cevil\u201d when viewed from the conventions of the world?      \n\n\nOr perhaps your characters might simply take a break and play chess, cards, or suddenly start rocking out to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d. Now go have fun with it! *Blurb provided by u/wandering_cirrus.*       \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n- April 7 - Queen (this week)         \n- April 14 - Recovery    \n- April 21 - Struggle    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Perception](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/sersun_serial_sunday_perception/)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxnkgi4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel             \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/ky3fbhu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/OldBayJ         \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxoz94k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing            \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxt32uq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/AGuyLikeThat                \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/ky3o035/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/Zetakh                          \n         \n\n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below.

He assumes it is the King, and his eyes widen. *What\u2019s his Highness doing with the servants?* But then he spots the flowing chestnut hair so unlike Othomorus\u2019s patchy grey sprigs, the thin body that deeply contrasts the King\u2019s rotund form. A woman in royal colours strides in his direction.\n\nA hand pats his back; Thosius turns to Orethia, who glares at him from where she bows. He copies her just in time, as the regal woman passes by.\n\nAs they rise, Thosius asks Orethia, \u201cWho was that?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d She raises an eyebrow. \u201cThat was the Queen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe--eh?\u201d\n\nShe laughs, her voice cracking. \u201cWhat do you mean \u2018eh\u2019? You\u2019ve not heard of the position of Queen?\u201d\n\nScrewing his face in embarrassment, he soon grins. *Slowly getting used to her jibes.* \u201cI know what a queen is. But I thought since Queen Shathia, his Highness has been a widow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to use the polite terms around me. Shathia was the last to sit beside Othomorus in the Great Hall. If anything, I think dealing with her husband\u2019s problems quickened her demise. So Udret prefers to stay behind the scenes, you know; do things her own way.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh\u2026 like visit the servants?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe takes a hands-on approach to things here.\u201d She smirks. \u201cEruthan doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose he wouldn\u2019t. Hmm, Udret? Not a Thirasian name.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the daughter of the Lord of Merukta.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen she\u2019s far from her homeland.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine it\u2019s a lot warmer here than the northern tundra. Anyway, it\u2019s some kind of political thing, not at all my concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor mine. What were we doing again?\u201d\n\nShe narrows her eyes for a moment, mouthing something, before snickering. \u201cI\u2019d forgotten too. The laundry baskets are full.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nWater laps against the edges of the washing trough as it flows between the pipe and the drain. Thosius lets the stocking wave in the current, sweat drifting from it in a cloud. By this point, he has seen so many forms of human muck, it no longer causes him nausea.\n\n\u201cTold you you\u2019d catch on quick,\u201d Orethia says, brushing dried mud from some shoes. \u201cI\u2019m a good teacher.\u201d\n\nHe smiles. \u201cThat you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you thought any more, about what I said?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat more is there to think on? I watch your back, you watch mine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but, will you be *taking your earnings*?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter decide, Thistrus; king could die any day.\u201d\n\nSomeone opens the door behind them. Thosius turns to see the Queen standing over them, watching them work. Orethia winces.\n\n\u201cWhat were you saying about my husband?\u201d Udret asks in a sing-song voice, emphasising the vowels.\n\n\u201cYour Highness,\u201d he says, standing to attention, \u201cwe were talking about his clothes.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Your Grace*,\u201d she corrects him. \u201cHow quaint, servants talking about clothes.\u201d There is a querulous, mocking undertone to her words.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your Grace,\u201d Orethia says, taking over. \u201cThere is little else to discuss for simple folk like us.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Tut tut*. You must hide your spite better, Orethia.\u201d\n\nStanding up straight, Orethia flashes Thosius a grin. She then turns to the Queen, and the two hug. Then Orethia turns back to him. \u201cOh, your poor face, Thistrus.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe looks so confused,\u201d the Queen chuckles.\n\nThosius widens his eyes, looking between them. \u201cWhat\u2026 is going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s how things are,\u201d Orethia begins to explain. \u201cEveryone in power has spies. The King has them, as does Eruthan no doubt; probably every member of the nobility who isn\u2019t a child has them. I am Udret\u2019s spy, here in the palace..\u201d\n\nHe feels his jaw hanging low, so he pulls it back up. \u201cSpying on who, exactly?\u201d\n\n\u201cEruthan, the other servants\u2026 anyone of interest. Like you.\u201d\n\nThe Queen steps closer. \u201cWe know you are one of Eruthan\u2019s spies. Orethia here plied you with questions, and noticed while your mouth said one thing, your eyes told otherwise. Honestly, that man astonishes me, such a quintessence of stupidity as he is. He could not even find himself a decent agent?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026 uh\u2026\u201d Thoughts tumble through his mind, but eventually he settles on one. *Shit. I\u2019ve already failed.* \u201cWhat will happen to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d Udret folds her arms. \u201c*If* you work for me instead of that *pompous* old fool. Feed him lies about my activities, waylay him; all while telling me of his movements, plans, anything you can get your grubby little hands on.\u201d\n\n*Huh. She thinks I\u2019m spying on her. Well\u2026* \u201cAlright, seems I have no choice.

His expression is placid, unreadable, his strangely large lips so slack they remind Thosius of a frog\u2019s. \u201cSo she caught on, did she?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d Thosius says. \u201cI don\u2019t think she has anything to do with Baltathaius.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. But I was asking you to relay anything suspicious to me.\u201d\n\nThosius rubs his face. \u201cYou knew I\u2019d end up telling you about the Queen and her actions, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nGrinning, Eruthan places the quill in the inkpot. \u201cTwo birds, one stone. But it seems I underestimated her once again. Clever as her father, that one.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are to look for signs of the Inquisition, as always. But tell her lies relating to my movements, so that she will be as uninformed as she believes me to be.\u201d\n\nThosius sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re putting a lot on my shoulders.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all for the betterment of Thiras, I assure you.\u201d\n\nTurning to go, Thosius opens the door a crack, only for the advisor to cough behind him.\n\n\u201cOh, and this time Thosius, make it more convincing. I know you are not by any means an actor, but just\u2026 try, will you?\u201d\n\nGripping the door a little tighter on his way out, Thosius ensures he slams it shut, just a little.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWC: 1000\n\nBonus words: querulous, quaint, quintessence, quickened.\n\nCrit and feedback are welcome.\n\n[Chapter Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/StickiesStories/comments/16ilkx0/thosius_chapter_index/)"}, {"comment_text": "Heya Max!\n\nAbbreviated feedback during WORD OFF\n\nI laughed when Thosius didn't recognize the Queen.

You don't just say things like \"king could die any day.\" xD  I really like her though!  Very fun character.\n\nOne of these days I'll understand the differences between Your Highness/Majesty/Grace.  But not this day.\n\nOpenly admitting to spycraft?  They *must* know who Thosius is to loop him in so soon.  And they're obviously plotting to kill the king.  I need a bigger bucket of popcorn to watch this unfold.\n\nAlthough it's not impossible this is all an elaborate test by Eruthan.\n\nI feel bad for Thosius in this last section.

Do you have a self-established universe you\u2019ve been writing or planning to write in? Do you have an idea for a world that\u2019s been itching to get out? This is the perfect place to explore that. Each week, I post a theme to inspire you, along with a related image and song. You have 500 - 1000 words to write your installment. You can jump in at any time; writing for previous weeks\u2019 is not necessary in order to join. After you\u2019ve posted, come back and provide feedback for at least 1 other writer on the thread.

Regardless of whether it refers to honest-to-goodness royalty, prom queens, drag queens, or anything in between, queens are usually associated with femininity, beauty, and the power that comes with both. How does your \u201cqueen\u201d react to this? Are they self-assured, confident in their femininity and strength? Do they flinch away, desperately clinging to a preconceived mask as they secretly crumble under the weight of their own or others\u2019 expectations? What does your queen and how people react to them say about the concept of feminine power in your world? What sort of role model is your \u201cqueen\u201d? Are the traits they embody considered \u201cgood\u201d? Or do they become \u201cevil\u201d when viewed from the conventions of the world?      \n\n\nOr perhaps your characters might simply take a break and play chess, cards, or suddenly start rocking out to \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d. Now go have fun with it! *Blurb provided by u/wandering_cirrus.*       \n\nThese are just a few things to get you started. Remember, the theme should be present within the story in some way, but its interpretation is completely up to you. For the bonus words (not required), you may change the *tense*, but the base word should remain the same. **Please remember to follow all sub and post rules.**     \n\n[**Don\u2019t forget to sign up for Saturday Campfire here!**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQPPx4WCaDmjiCzboXfBJLixTV3picjXU1NsJmH05_OfEbgw/viewform?usp=sf_link) We start at 1pm EST and provide live feedback!\n \n***\n###Theme Schedule:\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n- April 7 - Queen (this week)         \n- April 14 - Recovery    \n- April 21 - Struggle    \n\n      \n***        \n&nbsp; \n[**Previous Themes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/sersun/)  |  [**Serial Index**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/serial_sunday_serials/)      \n&nbsp;\n***\n\n#Rankings for [Perception](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/sersun_serial_sunday_perception/)       \n   \n- [**First**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxnkgi4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/MeganBessel             \n- [**Second**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/ky3fbhu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/OldBayJ         \n- [**Third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxoz94k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/ZachTheLitchKing            \n- [**Fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/kxt32uq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/AGuyLikeThat                \n- [**Fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1btg3aj/comment/ky3o035/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - u/Zetakh                          \n         \n\n\n***        \n#Rules & How to Participate\nPlease read and follow all the rules listed below.

All submissions should be given (at least) a *basic editing pass* before being posted!\n\n- **Begin your post with the name of your serial between triangle brackets** (e.g. <My Awesome Serial>). When our bot is back up and running, this will allow it to recognize your serial and add each chapter to the SerSun catalog. Do not include anything in the brackets you don\u2019t want in your title. (Please note: You must use this same title every week.)\n\n- **Do not pre-write your serial.** You\u2019re welcome to do outlining and planning for your serial, but chapters should not be pre-written.

(Submitting late is not an exception to this rule.)     \n\n- **Missing your feedback requirement two or more consecutive weeks will disqualify you from rankings and Campfire readings the following week.** If it becomes a habit, you may be asked to move your serial to the sub instead.\n\n- **Serials must abide by subreddit content rules.** You can view a [full list of rules here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/wiki/index/rules).

Leaving her army behind with the capital city of the now-fallen Empire made her feel free, but exposed.  She was glad to have Glaukos around for company...for the most part.\n\n\"So!\" her old friend gave her a gentle nudge to the ribs with his elbow, \"how's everything going with Helen?\"\n\n\"I don't want to talk about it.\"  Cass would have pulled her camel away to get some distance from the ever-prying man.  They were both hitched to the wagon though.\n\n\"That bad, huh?\" He whistled a low note.  \"Anything you can do about it?  I hate to see you leave her in a bad way.  You two were always a quaint pair.\"  The wagon wheels clacked rhythmically on the sandstone road that carried her away from familiarity and friends.  Part of her was looking forward to the freedom it entailed.\n\n\"Tell me about everyone we're traveling with,\" Cass said, changing the subject.  \"I already know Kebb and Anatu well enough.  And the twins...introduced themselves.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" he groaned querulously.  The beanpole leaned forward and gestured at the person just ahead of them; the big, broad, round man from Shen with colorful ribbons braided into his beard.  \"Big guy is is Kher.  Nicest guy you'll ever meet.  Just don't be an ass to him; he's the quintessence of cooking on the road.\"\n\n\"Right, I want to be his friend then.\" Cass agreed with a nod.  She liked people who could cook.\n\n\"Let's see...the short one next to him is Mica.  Cholish, like your friend Cit.  A bit serious but she's good with a sword.\"\n\n\"Isn't she a bit young to be on a mission like this?\"\n\n\"Young?\" Glaukos laughed.  \"She's just tiny.  Also, don't call her tiny.  Or small.  Or bite-sized.  Or mini-Mica.  Or-\"\n\n\"How many times has she kicked your ass?\"\n\n\"Once for each nickname.  So quite a few.\"\n\nCass joined his laugh this time.  She knew Glaukos wouldn't - *couldn't* - stop with pestering someone.  Even if it resulted in bodily harm.  Perhaps especially so.\n\n\"What about the other kid?\"\n\n\"That would be Iuven.  He actually *is* rather young, but his father's some big shot in Harenae and wanted him to come along to represent their interests.\" Glaukos shrugged. \"Whatever that means.  Kind of full of himself but not a bad guy.\"\n\n\"And the Shen woman?\" \n\n\"Maar.  Not much to say about her other than she fought in the war and keeps to herself.  Really quiet type.  I don't think I've heard her say more than five words.\"\n\n\"Huh, really?\"\n\n\"Nah.\" Glaukos laughed.  \"Literally just met her today.\"\n\nThe small caravan crossed over some low bridges spanning gaps that channeled water in from the Great River to the nearby farms.  There was a faint fishy scent from the water that Cass found unpleasant, so she urged the camels forward.  Their pace quickened.\n\n\"So what's Helen like these days?\" Glaukos asked.  \"I've seen some of her sermons during the Festival of Flame but haven't had the chance to sit down and-\"\n\n\"She's fine.  Why don't you tell me about that one,\" she gestured to the back of the other Sammosan in the group, with the long curly hair and strong shoulders.\n\n\"Oh, that's Charis.  They've been wanting to meet you too; they were a slave in Sammos until the rebellion.  One of the eastern provinces I think?  Totally your type.\"\n\n\"My type?\" Cass asked, looking at her friend incredulously.  \"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\n\"I mean look at them,\" he swept his hand toward Charis, \"Those arms, that back, that *hair*.\"  Glaukos ran his fingers through his own curls and flicked them flamboyantly.  \"I *know* you're a sucker for great hair.\"\n\n\"Uh-huh, sure.\" She reached over and patted his shoulder.  \"Whatever you say, Glaukos.\"\n\n\"Don't believe me?\"  He grinned and lifted his fingers to his lips, ready to whistle.  Cass's eyes widened and she grabbed his wrist, pulling it not too gently away from his mouth.\n\n\"How about, 'no'?\"\n\n\"Talk about Helen,\" Glaukos said as he tugged his arm out of Cass's grip when she let him have the hand back.  \"Cass, I can *tell* you're upset.  You've been mopey since you came out of the tent and Cit told me-\"\n\n\"*What* did he tell you?\"  Cass had fallen into his trap, and before she could grab his hand again he let out a loud, piercing whistle that got everyone's attention.\n\n\"Hey! Charis!\" He waved for them to come closer. \"Let me introduce you to your hero!\"\n\nAt least Cass wasn't the only one blushing as Charis slowed their camel to join her and Glaukos at the rear of the caravan, flanking him on the other side.\n\n\"Cass, Charis.  Charis, Cass.\"  Glaukos gestured between them.  \"Cass, you're quite popular among freed Sammosans like us.  Charis has been singing about your exploits and-\"\n\n\"I think that's quite enough, Glaukos.\" Charis reached out and grabbed the much scrawnier man's shoulder; their hand nearly big enough to cover his shoulder.\n\n\"So you like to sing?\" Cass asked, looking past Glaukos and taking in Charis's strong jaw and light brown eyes.\n\nThey cleared their throat before answering.  \"Well, it was one of my duties on the Troilus estate.\"\n\n\"Troilus?\" Cass asked.  \"Glaukos and I worked for Lord Cephalus Phoebus.\"\n\n\"Yes, Glaukos mentioned.\"  Charis's smile relaxed some.  \"He also mentioned you had an affinity for the wine we made.\"\n\n\"Whenever I could swipe an amphora, yeah.\"\n\n\"When I wasn't singing for my master, I was crushing grapes or hauling crates.\"\n\n\"The crate part shows,\" Cass said while lifting her right arm up and giving a flex.  \"I was the one carrying water up and down the mansion stairs, and anything else heavy that needed moving.\"\n\nThe conversation continued on as the group took the road north away from the Great River, heading through the farmlands and out towards the open desert.\n\n\\----------  \nWC: 996/1000  \nAll crit/feedback welcome!  \nr/TomesOfTheLitchKing  \n[\\[Chapter Index: Casting Shadows\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/TomesOfTheLitchKing/comments/17ttzt4/sersun_chapter_index_casting_shadows/)\n\nNotes:  \n- Bonus words: Quaint, querulous(ly), quintessence\n- Recommend any new readers use the linked chapter index above; those chapters receive more edits than the ones in past sersun posts"}]}, {"post_title": "[OT] Micro Monday: Madness!", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1bza4vs/ot_micro_monday_madness/", "post_comments": [{"comment_text": "#Welcome to Micro Monday\n\nHello writers and welcome to Micro Monday!

I raged from the lectern at my tenured Cambridge that they\u2019d studied human history and assessed our women were far weaker then our men.

The mansion was inhabited by a peculiar family: a father, his son from a previous marriage, his new wife with extraordinarily large dimensions, and his first wife, a woman afflicted with a rare combination of medical conditions that left her that it was a medical marvel she could still walk. its name whispered in hushed tones by the locals, a monument to a chilling tale of love, loss, and the uncanny. The house, however, also bore witness to a grim chapter that would forever echo through its halls. as it was marked by an eerie silence that soon gave way to a haunting symphony of disembodied heartbeats, each distinct in its rhythm and tone.\n\nThe son, an introverted teenager named Eli, a curious soul, had always been fascinated by the occult, learning about it and watching videos of the paranormal and the like. sometimes describing himself a goth and going to his father's study room and reading old books. during his free time, he delved into so-called ancient rituals. His biological mother, Marianne, despite being Christian, hated her son doing that stating that it is the devil's work and wonders why she even gave birth to such a child. with her unusual heart conditions and her equally unusual figure, often felt like a living embodiment of the arcane mysteries Eli read about in his medical books.\n\nMarianne used to grow up in a small, conservative town, the kind where everyone knows each other's business. She was always a standout, not just for her intellect but for her striking appearance, but that soon changed when she was marked by her unusual gigantomastia later in her adulthood. Despite facing challenges and health issues related to her condition, Marianne pursued a career in nursing, driven by a desire to help others and make a tangible difference. Her meeting with Eli's father was serendipitous, a blend of curiosity and fate. Marianne's heart condition became a significant part of her life, shaping her existence in profound ways.\n\nwhile she was sick, she was taking many drugs to ease her unbearable pain, and by that she was secretly a drug addict, not wanting to bring ever shame to her son and to the rest of her family. She was later diagnosed with macromastia, then later gigantomastia. His mother unfortunately found she was being diagnosed with cardiomegaly and later having a severe condition of cardiomyopathy, causing her heart to grotesquely enlarge. But that wasn't over; the next year she was found to have a grapefruit-sized thoracic aortic aneurysm with a class II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Then later on that month, there was a pulmonary artery aneurysm that was abnormally big and a pulmonary venous aneurysm. and just a year later, rare fusiform superior and inferior vena cava aneurysms. This was all caused by her stress and a family history of heart conditions. Sadly, by also being a drug addict, injecting herself with liquid cocaine made it far worse than anyone imagined. her doctors and cardiologists even tried to beg her to undergo surgery as it would save her life. nut by being a Christian conservative hated the idea of having blood transfusions and surgery, as she believed that she was in God's hands. How she is still alive is beyond their understanding and to her son's. but nevertheless, she was still my mom. Despite her being a tall, slim woman (6'6\"), she was still trying to attract my dad; she had even been popping breast enhancement pills. until it was becoming a detriment to her health, so she had been baker acted just for her health and safety by her husband as he couldn't see his ex-wife in such a state. But it was Marianne's condition that truly captivated Eli, her heart being a nexus of both his love and his deepest fears.\n\nHe just feels bad for her. However, when his dad divorced his mom and remarried this physically fit, voluptuous woman who was into modeling and used to be such a gym rat, instead she was into plastic surgery and makeup having Body dysmorphic disorder or BDD, which is a mental health condition in which you can't stop thinking about one or more perceived defects or flaws in your appearance \u2014 a flaw that appears minor or can't be seen by everyone. But for her, she might've felt so embarrassed, ashamed and anxious that she may avoid many social situations by having implants. despite having so many followers in Instagram, twitter and Facebook and secretly by having an Only Fans account that even his father hasn't known about. Eli may have felt bad for his father but his taste in women was unusual. She was a shrewd and evil woman. His stepmother, Helena, was a towering presence, both in stature and personality; her physique was sculpted and exaggerated to the point of disbelief, presumably having giant saline implants. only caring for herself and her modeling work. until she was having bad behavior and even abusing me whenever his father wasn't around. and now that he was away on his business trip to Toronto for three weeks for the auction of prized artifacts.\n\nHelene's life was always centered around physical fitness and appearance. From her teenage years, she was deeply involved in sports, transitioning into bodybuilding as she grew older. Her dedication turned her into somewhat of a local celebrity, and eventually, she found success as a fitness model, her unique attribute's setting her apart in the industry in social media. This aspect of her life led to a form of athletic heart syndrome, a condition she thought that she managed carefully, balancing her health with the demands of her career. Meeting Eli's father was a whirlwind of shared interests in physical and mystical disciplines, though she never fully embraced the latter's darker inclinations.\n\nBut it was Marianne's condition that truly captivated Eli, her heart being a nexus of both his love and his deepest fears.\n\nEverything is going to get worse for him. But his stepmom was soon becoming an addict herself, being a plastic surgery junky, as she had these breast implants, and soon, month after month, she increased their size to a staggering triple z cup and 10,040 cc's. but despite this athletic heart syndrome (AHS) and exercise-induced cardiomegaly. even though the condition is generally considered benign, it may occasionally hide a serious medical condition or may even be mistaken for one. But for her, she didn't care; beauty was what she wanted. but it was getting to be embarrassing. I just don't know what my dad sees in this woman.\n\nhe remembered that he had a heart-to-heart conversation with his father. as he opened up to saying that everyone at his school knows about his stepmother and the gossip that surrounds her and his mother. So, in the dimly lit study, surrounded by ancient tomes and artifacts, Eli's father often spoke of the world's hidden wonders. His life's work had taken him from the scholarly halls of academia to the remote corners of the earth, seeking the threads that connect the physical to the mystical. His fascination with extremes of human form, including his appreciation for women with large breasts, was part of his broader quest to understand the limits and potentials of human existence.\n\n\"To me,\" he once explained to Eli, under the glow of a single lamp, \"the human body is a map of countless stories, each mark, each curve holding its mysteries. My interest in ample forms, like those of your mother and Helene, is rooted in this same curiosity and awe. It's about the diversity of human experience, the physical embodiments of abundance and vitality that have been revered, mythologized, and even deified across cultures and epochs.\"\n\nThis reverence was not without its complexities. Marianne and Helene, each in their way, navigated the world burdened and blessed by their physicality. They were acutely aware of the gaze they attracted, often laden with uninvited assumptions and desires. Yet, within the family's private sanctuary, they found a space where their forms were celebrated as part of the vast tapestry of human diversity\u2014a celebration deeply tied to Eli's father's beliefs and studies. For Eli, it was a complete and utter nonsense hearing the words coming from his father's mouth.\n\nWhen he ran down the stairs, he saw it was none other than his mom, sickly, gaunt, and pale. but seeing those two have those large round breasts was embarrassing for him. Until they looked at him and started to argue with him and even curse profanity. Calling him a mistake and saying that my mom wished that she had an abortion, saying that it was the cause of her problems. His stepmom blames me for not having my dad focus on her.\n\nAnd it was going to be the worst Mother's Day ever for him. Eli had stumbled upon an ancient grimoire in the attic one dusty afternoon. Its pages whispered secrets of the unknown, of powers that could bend the very fabric of reality. The book spoke to him, its words intertwining with his own veins, urging him to delve deeper into the shadowy arts. It promised knowledge, power, and perhaps a way to cure his mother's ailments. Seduced by the possibility of wielding such power, Eli began experimenting with rituals and spells under the cloak of night, ignorant of the forces he was about to unleash.\n\nNow Eli's father, Jonathan, is a man of complex history and mysterious talents. He's an academic by training, holding a Ph.D. in Anthropology and History, with a deep interest in occult practices and their historical contexts. Throughout his career, he's traveled extensively, researching ancient rituals, forgotten cults, and supernatural phenomena. Despite his academic credentials, he's always harbored a belief in the darker corners of magic, leading him to collect rare artifacts and grimoires. His marriage to Marianne brought stability, but his secretive pursuits often created distance within the family.\n\nOne stormy evening, with the mansion enveloped by the relentless grip of a tempest, Eli decided to perform a ritual he believed could grant him control over life itself. The mansion's peculiar ambiance intensified, its heartbeat-like sounds growing louder, almost in anticipation. In the ritual's climax, Eli unwittingly summoned a demon, a creature from the abyss, drawn by the promise of two unique hearts dwelling within the mansion's walls.\n\nThe demon, a grotesque manifestation of darkness, materialized with intentions far from benevolent. It sought the hearts of Marianne and Helena, lured by their extraordinary conditions. Marianne's enlarged, labyrinthine heart, burdened by its own mass and the network of aneurysms that clung to it like parasites, and Helena's robust, athletic heart, both became objects of the demon's desire. The entity saw in them trophies\u2014sources of power to be kept.\n\nIn the chaotic crescendo of that fateful night, as shadows danced with the tempest outside, the demon, with unholy precision, reached into the very essences of Marianne and Helena, extracting their hearts with a malevolence and with terrifying precision that was palpable in the air. Marianne's heart, a grotesque marvel of medical anomalies, was a sight to behold. Enlarged to more than thrice the size of a normal heart, it was a tangled mass of flesh, veins, and aneurysms. The superior vena cava and inferior vena cava aneurysms bulged ominously, resembling twisted vines on the verge of bursting. The thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, swollen to the size of a grapefruit, gave the heart an almost alien appearance. Pulmonary artery and venous aneurysms added to this bizarre tableau, creating a heart that was as terrifying as it was fascinating.\u00a0**Boom-BOOM... Boom-BOOM...**\n\nHelena's heart, though vastly different in its pathology, was no less extraordinary. It was robust, enlarged by her athletic endeavors to a degree that spoke of both strength and an unnatural stretching of natural limits. Her heart, though not marred by the aneurysms that plagued Marianne's, pulsed with a vigor that was unnatural; its chambers and vessels thickened, a testament to her body's adaptation to extreme physical demands.\u00a0**Thud-thud-Thud-thud-Thud-thud...**\n\nChaos ensued as the demon, with terrifying precision, extracted their enlarged hearts from both of these women. The mansion, once filled with the peculiar yet familiar rhythms of life, now resonated with the screams of its inhabitants. Eli, in horror, realized the grave mistake his dabbling had caused. His pursuit of power had not only endangered his family but had also desecrated the sanctity of life itself. Their blood splattered all over the marble floor became a pool, and the smell of iron was so strong that Eli became dreary and nauseous, at to a point to vomiting on himself. The demon stared at the boy, chanting in venomous words sucking the energy right out of the room.\n\nThe demon held these hearts in its shadowy appendages, contemplating them and for a moment, the very air seemed to throb with their power. Marianne's heart, despite its grotesque enlargement and the myriad of dilated aneurysms that adorned it, still beat with a rhythm that was eerily human, a testament to the life it once sustained. Helena's, on the other hand, pulsed with a force that was both awe-inspiring and terrifying, reflecting the immense physical power of her enlarged heart that she once wielded.\n\nIn the eerie silence that followed by the demon's actions, the once-vibrant mansion, now shrouded in a veil of despair, bore witness to an unexpected turn. The demon, in a move that seemed to mock the very essence of life and death, appointed the boy, the son caught in the crossfire of ambition and occult practices, as the caretaker of the two hearts that once beat within his mother, Marianne, and his stepmother, Helena until his death. These organs, are now grotesque trophies of a dark ritual gone awry, were imbued with a sinister vitality, continuing to beat even after their extraction.\n\nEli, his soul torn between grief and an unsettling sense of duty, due to his mistake, accepted his role as the guardian of these pulsating relics. The hearts, encased in two large, decorative wooden chests that the demon had carved, were suspended in a realm between life and death, their rhythmic beating a constant reminder of the women they once animated. Placing Marianne's enlarged heart, with its labyrinth of dilated aneurysms and twisted vessels, throbbed with a somber cadence, while Helena's robust and unnaturally enlarged heart pulsed with a vigor that belied its tragic fate within that cursed wooden chests.\n\nWhen Eli's father, Jonathan, returned home from his three-week business trip from Toronto, he was totally unprepared for the eerie transformation that had overtaken his once familiar abode. The air was thick with an inexplicable tension, a silent warning of the altered reality within the walls of his home. The usual vibrancy that greeted him, the warmth that had once been the essence of their family life, was conspicuously absent, replaced by a cold stillness that seemed to resonate from the very foundation of the house.\n\nAs Jonathan stepped inside, he began to have an unusually bad feeling as the change was palpable. The ambient light seemed to flicker unnaturally, casting long, stretching shadows that danced with a life of their own. The house was silent, yet it was a silence filled with whispers, the kind that prickled at the back of his neck, a constant reminder that he was not alone.\n\nThe heartbeats, though Jonathan had yet to understand their origin or significance, were the most disturbing development. They pulsed through the house with a rhythm that was both foreign and intimately familiar, echoing in the empty hallways and seeping into the recesses of his mind. These were not just auditory hallucinations; they were a manifestation of something profoundly unnatural that had rooted itself in the core of their home.\n\nAs he ventured further, Jonathan could feel the weight of unseen eyes upon him, a scrutinous gaze that seemed to bore into his very soul. The air grew colder, the atmosphere denser, as if the house itself was drawing breath, alive with the spirits that now dwelt within.\n\nWhen he finally reached the heart of the home, where the heartbeats seemed to converge, Jonathan was met with an overwhelming sense of loss and desperation. It was here, in the living room, transformed into a shrine of sorrow and longing, that he finally discovered the corpses of Marianne and Helene. He could hear their cries, barely audible whispers carried on the air, told a tale of anguish and entrapment, a perpetual state of in-between that tethered them to the physical world. he collapsed in tears, dropping to his knees, as he watched the horror before him.\n\nThe realization of what had transpired in his absence, the horrific fate that had befallen his ex-wife that he tried to save, and his current wife, hit Jonathan with the force of a tidal wave. Guilt, sorrow, and an indescribable fear mingled within him for not being there, a cocktail of emotions that left him paralyzed. His home, once a sanctuary of love and family, had become a prison of memories and spirits, a haunted mausoleum that held the remnants of his past life. he noticed that his son was nowhere to be seen. he called Eli out, hoping to get an answer, his heart pounded in his chest hoping that his son is safe, looking in and around his house.\n\nWhen Jonathan found Eli, the scene before him was one of surreal horror and inexplicable sorrow. His son was huddled in a dimly lit corner of the attic, the air thick with a palpable sense of dread. In front of Eli, on a makeshift altar, lay two pulsating hearts, their beats syncopated yet hauntingly beautiful in their tragic chorus. The hearts, grotesquely enlarged and veined, beat with a life of their own, ensnared in a ritual of preservation that defied the natural order. Jonathan's gaze shifted from the hearts to his son, witnessing the torment and obsession that had consumed Eli. The realization that these beating hearts belonged to Marianne and Helene, now forever bound to this world through their son's misguided love and the dark arts, filled Jonathan with a profound despair. In this attic, time seemed to stand still, the only sound the unyielding rhythm of two hearts that refused to be silenced, even in death.\n\nIn that moment, Jonathan understood the true cost of the dark arts that Eli had dabbled in, the irreversible path that had led them to this nightmarish reality. His house, with its disembodied heartbeats and ghostly apparitions, was a stark reminder of the barrier they had crossed, a boundary that was never meant to be breached.\n\nAs he stood there, engulfed by the haunting melody of the heartbeats, Jonathan knew that their lives had been irrevocably changed. The house, a character in its own right, had become a living testament to the consequences of their actions, a place where the past and present merged in a perpetual dance of shadows and light, love and loss, life and death.\n\nEli, now the caretaker of these throbbing diabolical relics, understood the gravity of his role. He became a bridge between the living and the spectral, communicating with the imprisoned spirits, offering solace, and seeking redemption for the roles they all played in this tragedy. The mansion, with its dark history and spectral occupants, became a sanctuary of sorts, a place where the veil between worlds was thin and where love, loss, and penance intertwined. there are some nights where unwanted visitors who come to the house, wanting to know if the stories were true, report hearing these heartbeats, accompanied by spectral cries and screams that pierce the silence, manifestations of Marianne and Helene's unrest. Some even claim to see their apparitions, women of ethereal beauty, with glowing orbs in their chests where their hearts once resided, beating in a ghostly rhythm, illuminating their path through the darkness.\n\nThe haunting began subtly, with neighbors reporting faint sounds in the dead of night, akin to the beating of a heart, rhythmic and relentless. These sounds, initially dismissed as figments of an overactive imagination, grew in intensity as they began calling it the Heartbeat House.", "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

I can\u2019t be specific regarding the time for my only reference is a faint beam of sunlight coming through the window grating. People seemed to walk about in a hurry outside, discussing among themselves some matter of critical importance. Prolonged exposure to deafening silence had sharpened my listening skills to the point that I could pick up their whispers. But I didn\u2019t bother enough to piece the matter together. I had no reason to. My mind was perfectly calm and I couldn\u2019t feel much of my body. I was at peace, and it was peacefully that I drifted off to a sleep like state.\n\nIt was when the commotion had turned into an uproar and the distressed whispers had escalated into panicked shouts, that I came back to my senses. I couldn\u2019t tell the time anymore. The sun had been curtained by, presumably gray clouds. \n\u201cThey\u2019re done with the other tower. Once the upper half is done we\u2019ll get started with this corridor. Be on standby till then and be vigilant.\u201d The words echoed down the passage. \n\nIt was usually painful for me to extend energy towards thought and observation. But I was curious for once. I thought I could hear the sound of metal clanking against metal. Those long chains probably. But they bring those out very rarely. Something big was underway. \n\nI started shivering all of a sudden. I hadn\u2019t realized before, but there was a strong gale outside. I could hear the roaring gust now, and I could feel the cold wind coming through the small window. It chilled my body down to the very bones. Waist down, my legs and feet were wet and cold. The floor underneath reeked of a foul stench unfit for living quarters. My blurry vision had somewhat stabilized now, and so I looked around without turning my head, I didn\u2019t want to risk feeling the burning sensation around my neck. It was the same old sight. \n\nA cockroach was helping itself on the crumbs left on the plate from last night in the corner. Or maybe it was from the day before yesterday? I couldn\u2019t remember. \n\u201cAm I hungry?\u201d I thought to myself as I felt my stomach growling perhaps.\u201dI\u2019m probably not.\u201d\n\nI thought I heard a rumbling sound in the distance. I instinctively turned my head at the sudden noise and as my wounded neck glided against the coarse metal,  the burning sensation overwhelmed my senses.\n\u201cI want to scream\u201d I thought. But I didn\u2019t. It felt useless. It wouldn\u2019t do me any good.\n\nWhy was I here again? What was I doing? What did I do that I have to endure this? It\u2019s been so long that I don\u2019t even remember what I did. But I did do something. Something bad perhaps. Or did I? I probably did, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise. \n\n\u201cAlright get on with it. All the other floors have been cleared. This is an emergency but don\u2019t forget that these are not men we\u2019re dealing with, they are animals and the most vicious ones of the bunch\u201d\n\nThe scurry of footsteps filled the corridor. The sharp sound of service boots striking against the stone floor was irritating. The old rusty gates were unlocked and opened wide with a cranking sound. Soon I noticed two silhouettes standing outside my door. The key was put in and the lock came undone with a click. The men in uniform walked inside in unison.\n\nOne of them grabbed me by my right arm and hoisted me up. I exhaled deeply through gritted teeth in an effort to sustain the pain.\n\u201cHurry up will ya.\u201d\n\u201cHold on a second, I can\u2019t find the key here.\u201d The man standing by door went through the key ring in his hands with scrutinous eyes.\n\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t find the key?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t. When was the last time we let him out anyways?\u201d\n\u201cNot in forever.\u201d\n\u201cWell its not here.\u201d\n\u201cSo what are we supposed to do? Just leave him be?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! Please.\u201d I thought.\n\n\u201cLeave him for now.\u201d said the main with the key ring as he walked out of the room. The other guard let go of my hand and I fell down with a thud. He looked at me with a sharp gaze before leaving. The door was left open. \n\nI leaned against the wall and closed my eyes. The long chains clanked again. They use those when multiple prisoners are to be transported at once. In all the time I\u2019ve been here, I can only recall one or two instances when those were used. It seems like all the prisoners are being mobilized. The other tower had been cleared first, then this one, and now finally the underground cells. \n\nThere was a sudden flash of light in the room. I could tell even through closed eyes and before I could even open them, the roaring sound of thunder shrouded every other noise. Everything fell silent for a moment, outside the room. Then the panic exploded.\n\u201cDrag them by their necks if you have to, I don\u2019t care. I want everyone garrisoned outside within the next ten minutes\u201d someone shouted with a tone of authority. \n\nMy back slipped against the wall and my head crashed into the filthy cold floor. I really wanted the noise to stop. I wanted my peace back. Having my head against the floor wasn\u2019t helping but I didn\u2019t feel like moving anymore. I curled up like a baby. I just wanted the noise to stop.\n\nIt did eventually. It seemed that they got everyone out before ten minutes were over and I was finally at peace, or so I thought before realizing that two pair of footsteps were headed towards me. \n\u201cAlright pick him up.\u201d\n\nThrough my now blurry vision I saw the same guard walk up to me. He pulled me up by right arm again. I couldn\u2019t tell if he knew and was doing it intentionally or fate was playing one of its cruel tricks on me again. I looked over to the other guard to see that he was carrying a large saw, one that needed to be held by both hands.\n\n\u201cAlright look, we can\u2019t find the key to your shackles and we don\u2019t really have the time to search for it. So we\u2019re just going to have to cut them open. We\u2019ll start with the one on your neck.\u201d\n\u201cNo, get the ones on his arms first\u201d said the first guard and then he pulled on my arm to stretch out the chain on the shakle.\n\u201cNo\u201d I gasped through gritted teeth in pain.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t do that. Its broken\u201d I could only muster enough strength to whisper the words to him.\n\u201cNever mind that\u201d he said. \u201cGet on with it.\u201d It was easy for him to say so, easy to look at the bigger picture I suppose.\n\nThe second man walked upto me and began sawing away at the chain all the while the first guard held my arm in a twisted position. The monotonous screeching sound soon blended into the surrounding noises. But the pain didn\u2019t. I\u2019m not usually bothered by the broken shoulder since I seldom move my hand. But this man was holding it in such a way that it was unbearable. I was going to break any second. \n\nI took a glance at the determined look on the man\u2019s face with which he was sawing, swallowed any guilt that I wasn\u2019t bothered by and screamed at the top of my voice\n\u201cSTOP.\u201d\nBoth of them looked at me in surprise. I suppose they weren\u2019t expecting me to be capable of such a roar. \n\u201cYou see the clouds outside?The lightning? There\u2019s a cyclone at the horizon. It will reach the shore by midnight and when it does, nothing will remain in this godforsaken island. The ship leaves in another hour. We can still make it on ti-\u201d\n\u201cJust stop\u201d I whispered this time.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understa-\u201d\n\u201dThat\u2019s enough\u201d said the first man and he let go of my arm. I fell on my face this time. It hurt but the cold floor felt good for once. I heard one pair of footsteps walk away. I somehow managed to lift my face to see what the owner of the other pair was upto. He was looking down on me. I knew that look all too well. It conveyed both sympathy and disgrace. \n\nHe dropped the saw on the floor and turned towards the door. I could hear him exhale deeply. He walked with firm steps on the cold stone floor. I lost my consciousness to the fading sound of the footsteps.", "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

Not knowing where he's going, or what he's looking for. Maybe he's just waiting to pass the time. \n\nHe takes the same route. 5 blocks down, then a right at the corner store. Then a right at the post office, and another right at the Metro PCS Store. This is his favorite route since there's only ladies on one street, and mostly empty on the rest. \n\nSometimes he'll look for change on the street, and buy some food when he reaches the store on the lap. If he's a little short the store owner might let him go. One day he gave him a 6-pack of ramen, candy, and some soda. The store owner has a photo of his family on the side of the wall. Sometimes  Mateo wished it was him in the photo with him. Other than that, they barely talk. \n\nMateo leaves home most of the day because his mom gets mad and has different boyfriensa than stay at their apartment. Mateo never liked them. He thinks the guys make his mom mean. \n\nMateo knew his dad before he went to prison. He visited him twice before they moved him to Oregon. He still gets letter every other week from him. He wants to write back but his mom stopped buying him stamps. He tried to take old stamps from older envelopes but they always get sent back. He feels guilty for not writing back, but he thinks his dad knows he still reads them. \n\nOne day, on Dec 22nd, Mateo walked his path, starving after getting kicked out the house early morning. One of the girls who works the blade on where he walks, let's call her Melanie, talks to him every now and then. \n\nMateo thinks she's pretty but she dressed to revealing where he doesn't want to look. She always asks him about school, his family, and if he's eaten. Mateo lies and said he just ate every time. \n\nMelanie looked worried, and told him she had left over pizza if he's hungry. Mateo, surprised at first, agreed and followed her to the motel across the street. Mateo hated this street because he gets teased for his long hair when he walks by.  \n\nShe gets him some water, and starts making a sandwich. She asked him what his favorite chips are and gave him a pack of spicy hot cheetos to go with it.\n\n\"How's everything back home?\" She asked. \n\n\"Good.\" He replied.\n\"Do you have any stamps?\"\n\"Stamps? No!? What do you need stamps for?\"\n\n\"No reason...\" he replied.\nShe gave him a coke and some cookies from the vending machine. \n\nMelanie looked at Mateo and asked him if his parents are okay with him staying out everyday and night. \n\nMateo said, \"Yes, but I just gotta be back by the morming.\"\n\nMelanie looked saddened to hear that. She has a Virgin Mary pendant that she played around with, and twirled. She rubbed the pendant so much you can see a slight curve on the front side. \n\nMelanie had a teddy bear tattoo with the name, \"Gabe\" written in cursive on her right shoulder. She looked at Mateo eat and hoped Gabe was eating too. And Gabe isn't walking alone at night like Mateo. She prayed Gabe was in a warm bed, with a night light, not having any idea who she is or what she does. \n\nMateo finished his food, started wiping his hands on his jeans, and started saying..\" *swallow* I want a stamp to write back to my dad. He's been asking if I have been getting his mail. I want to send a letter to let him know to keep sending them. And I write to every letter but I never have Stamps to send it.\"\n\n\" I want to tell him...\"\n\n * KNOCK KNOCK *\n\nWith haste, Melanie opens the door by a crack, whispers, and shows Mateo out. She hands him a $5 Bill and tells him to go home, as she has a business meeting to attend. The guy behind the door brought flowers and chocolates. She sees Mateo leave. He's leaves smiling knowing tommorow he'll go to the store, get some stamps, some ramen, and a soda with his $5 he just received. Melanie smiles while rubbing her pendant, hoping one day she'll get a second chance to make it right. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

At the very least, ride out the wave and see where things settled; easy enough to lie and say they were being kept hostage or something when the Empire got off of its ass and brought its might down on these invaders.\n\nThe road to Coristopitum was fairly well maintained, winding through a forest that Lacus would have been reluctant to go through in the dark.  But with the morning sun coming through the leaves the jaunt was relatively pleasant.\n\nThey had to cover about ten leagues, which would take them all day at a steady pace.  They weren't going to travel at a steady pace, and instead pushed their horses a little hard to cover more ground, then took a long rest at midday to eat the provisions the guards from Aesica gave them and let their rides rest.  After the horses were relaxed again, they mounted up and made the back half of the journey.\n\nIt may not have taken all day, but the sky was still getting dark when they finally saw the walls of Coristopitum over the crest of a hill.  As they drew closer, though, they saw the burnt remains of carts and tents along the road and even a few corpses from a recent fight.\n\nBut the Royal and Imperial crests still hung from banners on the city walls.\n\nThis time, when they approached, Prince Florus led the way with his hood down.  As much as Lacus didn't like the idea, he couldn't deny that it expedited the whole \"get into the walls and out of the open\" process.  When the city guards saw him they bowed and were quick to usher all three of them past the gate.\n\nFlorus's uncle - Magnus Dux Oleksander Pharez Avto Prasanna Fabricia - had them brought to the palace immediately.  Lacus didn't think of it as *much* of a palace - not compared to the one in Semperia - but it was far nicer thn the jail cell they'd had to sleep in the night before.\n\n\"Florus! My nephew!\" Oleksander ran down from his dias and embraced the prince.  \"I was so very worried!  We recieved a rider in the night that Semperia had fallen to invaders.\"\n\n\"It has,\" Florus answered solemnly.  \"You haven't had any word about my father have you?\"\n\n\"None,\" Oleksander said with a frown.  \"The fighting has become widespread.  The western provinces are engaged.  Why, just earlier today there was a rabble instigated outside the walls.\"\n\n\"Yes, we saw that on our way in,\" Florus said, frowning.  \"Were they Sammosans?\"\n\n\"Nah.\" the Dux waved his hand and shook his head.  \"It was our own citizens.  The ones who run a market out on the road were whipped into a frenzy by some strangers in white cloaks, much like what you are wearing.\"\n\n\"Yes, we used these to escape Semperia,\" Florus explained, tugging at his cloak.  \"They seem to be a part of the invading forces, though not very well armed.  They traveled with soldiers, though.  Sammosans and some strange yellow-haired men.\"\n\n\"You don't say?\" Oleksander's eyes were wide and his frown deepened.  \"I'll have to ask my captain if he knows anything of this.\"\n\n\"We are worried that they might be on the way north as well,\" Florus added, \"Can you send any soldiers to the south to stop them?  Maybe take back my city?\"\n\n\"The garrison here has already been deployed to assist with the fighting in the west.\"\n\n\"You shoulda sent them south,\" Lacus muttered, pinching the bridge of his nose.\n\nThe Dux looked past Florus and right at Lacus.  He had the upturned nose of someone who wasn't used to hearing back from a 'lesser', and Lacus knew he'd gotten rather complacent at informality around the Prince.\n\n\"You two guards are owed a great debt, bringing my nephew to me,\" Oleksander said.  \"Please, follow my man here to the kitchen to eat your fill.  Florus, you shall dine with me and we will consider what is to be done.  We shall send a falcon west immediately and...\"\n\nLacus didn't hear the rest of the conversation as he was ushered away by the palace guards and Secundus.  They were both given a seat in the kitchen and served a fairly standard meal for guards; some bread, cheese, and cooked meat.  Lacus was *starving* so it tasted amazing even if it was prepared in a hurry.\n\n\"So, whaddaya think about the Dux?\" he asked Secundus.\n\n\"Highly enough,\" Secundus answered, biting into a roll.  \"I'm not so pleased that the garrison here has already been deployed, and in the *wrong* direction.\"\n\n\"Think they'll be able to get reinforcements before the invaders get here?\" Lacus asked.\n\n\"Hmm, depends.\"  Secundus put down his food and sat back in his seat, stroking his mustache.  \"Fariba didn't seem to be in a hurry as we left the city, and I imagine they're not going to start marching until they've got it well secured.  Or at least have enough soldiers to maintain their grip while sending more out; you don't want a quarrelsome city at your flank during an invasion.\"\n\n\"Right, right,\" Lacus agreed offhandedly.  He didn't know much about military tactics nor did they interest him.  He just wanted to move Secundus along from what could easily become a long-winded lecture.  \"Let's go with the worst-case scenario.\"\n\n\"Well, in that case, they would be here the day after tomorrow, I'd say.  Assuming they travel in force, though, it would take them notably longer.  At a march, an army would get from Semperia to here in...three or four days?\"\n\nLacus looked up at one of the guards standing nearby.  They'd escorted the pair there to eat and were now just milling about, as though not eavesdropping.\n\n\"Maybe one of you should run off and tell whoever's in charge that?\" Lacus egged them.  The two palace guards shared a look, one shrugged and walked away.\n\n\"Why do they think we're gonna cause trouble?\" Lacus asked Secundus, grabbing an apple from the plate.\n\n\"Well, we did show up unannounced in the late evening.\" Secundus held up some fingers and counted off the marks against them.  \"Out of uniform.  With the prince, though, so that's in our favor.  But your behavior is...undisciplined.  You all but insulted the Dux in his throne room.  Had you not *just* delivered the prince to him safely you would likely be imprisoned.\"\n\n\"Well, that's all great then.\" Lacus leaned back and ate.  \"We can sit behind these nice and safe walls until the mob gets here.\"\n\n\"Speaking of,\" Secundus looked at the remaining guard, \"you may want to go find your superior and tell them that the citizens of Aesica are on their way.  The first ones will probably be arriving by midday tomorrow.\"\n\n\"And why's that?\" the guard asked.\n\n\"Because of the invaders.  Weren't you listening?\"\n\n\"Not really.\"  The man shrugged.\n\nLacus guffawed as Secundus got up and used his intimidating posture and well-practiced 'I'm-in-charge-here' glare to get the guard moving.  Once they were alone in the kitchen he rounded on Lacus, silencing him with a look.\n\n\"Lacus, I know you and the prince are close.  If this city is without *any* garrison and we only have a few days to prepare, then you must be ready to take the heir and flee at the first sign of danger.\"\n\nLacus nodded. \"Works for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you, for once, take this seriously?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am serious,\u201d Lacus said, sitting up straighter and looking back at Secundus with determination.  \u201cI\u2019m not a soldier, Secundus.  You damn well know that.  If I see danger, I\u2019m going to grab Florus and get the hells out of here. And I\u2019m gonna drag your hairy ass along, kicking and screaming all the way if needed.\u201d\n\n\\----------------  \n[\\[<= *Of Hiding & Help*\\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1c09kcw/fn_penumbra_chapter_7_of_hiding_help/) [\\[Chapter Index\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/TomesOfTheLitchKing/comments/1bt9vl7/index_penumbra/) [\\[*Of Defenses & Death* =>\\]]  \nAll crit/feedback welcome!  \nr/TomesOfTheLitchKing", "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

Our protagonist, a 23-year-old Floridian named Alex, had recently graduated with an MBA. Despite his casual attire\u2014ragged cargo shorts and flip-flops\u2014this young man was no ordinary customer. He\u2019d launched two successful businesses, and money flowed through his veins like the warm Gulf Stream current, carrying dreams of conquest and adventure.  \nOne sunny day, with the humidity clinging to his skin like a persistent lover, Alex dialed the dealership. His voice, as smooth as the Intracoastal Waterway at dawn, sought a trade-in value for his old truck\u2014an aging workhorse that had seen more sunrises than most. But curiosity tugged at him, like a child pulling at a kite string. The dealership\u2019s website teased him with gleaming images of brand-new F-150s, their chrome grilles winking like sunspots in the Florida heat.  \nThe salesman on the other end\u2014let\u2019s call him Larry, a man with a comb-over that defied both gravity and reason\u2014hadn\u2019t read Alex\u2019s resume. Larry\u2019s mental image of a truck-buying customer resembled a middle-aged man in a plaid shirt, not a beach-bound prodigy with an MBA. So, when Alex mentioned test drives, Larry\u2019s neurons misfired like a faulty spark plug. He led Alex to a 2018 Ford F-150, its odometer whispering tales of cross-country adventures, like an old bard recounting epic sagas.  \n\u201cBut sir,\u201d Alex protested, his patience fraying like a worn-out seatbelt, \u201cthis isn\u2019t what I asked about. I\u2019m not here to admire the leather seats or the finely tuned engine. I\u2019m here to buy.\u201d  \nLarry adjusted his tie, oblivious to the storm brewing. \u201cSon,\u201d he drawled, \u201cthose other trucks might be a tad out of your price range. You\u2019re just window-shopping, right? Admiring the shiny paint and the intoxicating scent of new car dreams?\u201d  \nAlex\u2019s flip-flops whispered defiance on the showroom floor. He left, the scent of missed commission trailing behind him like exhaust fumes from a revving engine. But dawn brought redemption. A new day, a new salesman. Meet Greg\u2014a man with a salt-and-pepper beard and eyes that held the secrets of a thousand road trips. Greg answered Alex\u2019s call, and the universe shifted, gears clicking into place.  \nThe customer made a cash offer for a gleaming, untouched F-150\u2014the kind that gleamed like a polished treasure chest, its leather seats awaiting the imprint of adventure. Greg, sensing destiny in the air, nodded solemnly. \u201cAlex,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ve come to the right place. This truck isn\u2019t just metal and rubber. It\u2019s possibility. It\u2019s the open road calling your name, the wind tousling your hair as you chase sunsets.\u201d  \nAnd so, under the Florida sun, Alex drove off in his new F-150, the engine purring like a contented cat. Larry watched from the sidelines, his comb-over wilting in defeat. As the palm trees swayed in approval, Alex knew that this wasn\u2019t just a purchase\u2014it was a chapter in the story of a man who dared to dream big, even in the land of endless summers.", "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

That really sucked.\r  \n\r  \nI was 29 and things were just starting to work out. I finally had a job I could tolerate. And I was thinking about dating again.\r  \n\r  \nI suppose none of that matters now.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m in processing. It\u2019s a bureaucratic mess. Apparently, my life history got mixed up with my cousin who died a couple weeks after me and he was returned, but now I have to wait for them to correct the timeline.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s the cosmic version of the DMV.\r  \n\r  \nI was supposed to be able to attend my funeral. I know this because there are a series of elevators where people come out crying. Their memories are voluntarily wiped clean after they\u2019re allowed to process it.\r  \n\r  \nThose memories are available later if they ever want to access them. There are several men and women dressed in their Sunday best who provide all these details as the bereaved sign off on their memories.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s not all bad. They have a nice hotel with a Casino if you\u2019re into gambling. I\u2019m not quite sure if there is a religious motif \u2013 I\u2019m a little nervous to ask for any details.\r  \n\r  \nI know this isn\u2019t heaven. There are no casinos in heaven, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be hell either.\r  \n\r  \nI met a guy named Jake who was in the hotel room across from me. He cannot remember anything about his life, which I guess is customary but due to the mix up I can still remember who I was and even the moment I died.\r  \n\r  \nI can\u2019t believe I was hit by a bus. At least I wasn\u2019t crossing the street. I was in my car driving through an intersection.\r  \n\r  \nThat\u2019s a very clich\u00e9 way to die.\r  \n\r  \nI decided to have dinner with Jake at the \u201call you can eat\u201d buffet. And when they say \u201call you can eat\u201d they\u2019re not lying. You can always be hungry here and nobody is overweight. We were there for what felt like hours eating and chatting. Mostly about my life since Jake could not remember anything about his life.\r  \n\r  \nI asked him how he knew his name was Jake and he couldn\u2019t explain it. I told him there was a famous song about a dog named Jake.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDo you think you can help me remember who I am?\u201d Jake asked, stuffing his face with his sixteenth serving of chocolate pie.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI doubt it\u201d I answered. \u201cI think your memories are stored in a central server or whatever they call it in this place.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nJake stopped eating for a moment, the wheels in his mind were spinning. \u201cMaybe we can break in and find my memories?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThis seemed like a pretty bad idea. No doubt we weren\u2019t the first after life guests to hatch a plan to retrieve old memories. But since I had nothing better to do, I decided to patronize him.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSure. I guess the first step is to ask around and find out where they\u2019re located?\u201d I said, lifting a glass of chocolate milk to toast to the idea.\r  \n\r  \nThe first place we visited was the Casino. You can lose all of your chips and just get more chips. We played roulette and tried to have as much small talk as we could but just like Jake nobody knew anything besides their first name and their room number.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then I had another idea. \u201cWe should talk to the men and women in the suits who comfort the bereaved as they exit the elevators.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWe went back to the main office and waited and waited. There isn\u2019t a sense of time here so I would like to say we waited for days, but there is no day or night. We just waited for a very, very long time. We waited so long the thought of eating became interesting again.\r  \n\r  \nAnd so, we found ourselves back at the all you can eat buffet.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe never sleep.\u201d I said to Jake while carefully cutting my fifth T-Bone steak. \u201cDo you miss sleep?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nJake thought about, \u201cI don\u2019t remember sleeping.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s when you close your eyes and have dreams.\u201d I put my fork and knife down and closed my eyes and pretended to start snoring.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLike that!\u201d I said, opening my eyes.\r  \n\r  \nJake didn\u2019t appear to understand and went back to his strawberry shortcake.\r  \n\r  \nI started to wonder what else doesn\u2019t happen here. \u201cJake\u2026 do you think we can die here?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nJake laughed, \u201cWe\u2019re already dead.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHe had a good point, but perhaps there were layers to this. \u201cWe need to test it out.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nA few moments later Jake and I were standing on the fifth level of the hotel looking down on the grand ballroom. \u201cWell, Jake, let\u2019s hope I am wrong.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI jumped off and landed on the piano which in a normal world would have broken into a thousand pieces. The middle-aged man playing the piano smiled and said, \u201cI guess you didn\u2019t want to take the stairs?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI felt embarrassed but nobody seemed to notice. A second later Jake landed flat on his back beside me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWow. That was fun.\u201d Jake said laughing.\r  \n\r  \nJake and I sat at the Roulette wheel discussing our failure to die, again.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMaybe if we jump from the 50th floor it will work better?\u201d Jake asked.\r  \n\r  \nThe man behind Roulette wheel broke from character for a brief moment listening to our conversation. \u201cWait. Wait. Do you know something?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\r  \nHe looked around as if he might be watched. \u201cYou can\u2019t die here. You\u2019re already dead.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThank you Captain Obvious.\u201d I responded.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIf you want out, you have to talk to Memphis. She's the only one wh-\u201c\r  \n\r  \nA red light went off and sirens.\r  \n\r  \nJake, oblivious, thought the flashing lights meant we had won something, \u201cThat\u2019s good right?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSeveral men in suits showed up at our table. \u201cThe roulette wheel is closed.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThey escorted the roulette player off.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWow.\u201d Jake said. \u201cI wonder how much he won?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI realized in that moment everything we said was being recorded. From the very moment I arrived my every move was being tracked. I wondered if they could also track my thoughts.\r  \n\r  \nWe decided to go back to our hotel rooms to retire for the\u2026 well, there was no night. I just sat in my bed and remembered how much I enjoyed sleeping. I lay there with my eyes wide open.\r  \n\r  \nI then laughed at how wrong Shakespeare was, \u201cTo die to sleep? Yeah right!\u201d I yelled.\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m not sure how long I lay awake in bed, but eventually there was a knock at the door. I knew it was Jake. I pretended to be surprised when I opened the door.\r  \n\r  \nI asked what he had been doing and then he told me they have free room service and he\u2019s been eating the entire time.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJake, I think we have to find the person whose name we cannot mention without setting off flashing red lights.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou mean Mem-\u201c I clasped my hands over his mouth. \u201cYes, that\u2019s the name.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOh right. I get it. We can\u2019t say the full name, so what are we going to call it?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI wasn\u2019t sure. I knew it had to be a really good name. Something we could both remember.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHow about donut?\u201d Jake said smiling.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDonut? Isn\u2019t that-\u201c\r  \n\r  \n\u201cPerfect? I love donuts.\u201d Jake interrupted.\r  \n\r  \nSo, donut became our code word.\r  \n\r  \nWe found ourselves back at the all you can eat buffet but neither one of us wanted to eat. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of strange. I know I can eat much as I want for as long as I want and now I don\u2019t want to eat anything.\u201d Jake said, depressed.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah. It\u2019s odd. Maybe if we could get fat we\u2019d still want to eat?\u201d I speculated.\r  \n\r  \nJake didn\u2019t remember obesity, so I had to explain to him what happens during real life when people eat as much as we'd been eating.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMaybe when we retrieve my memories everything will start to make sense. I\u2019ll remember what I did wrong to wind up here.\u201d Jake said.\r  \n\r  \nThis comment struck a chord. Did Jake view this place as a punishment?\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWait, what do you mean wind up here?\u201d I asked. \u201cThis place is awesome isn\u2019t it?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nJake thought about, \u201cIf you want to eat and gamble it\u2019s great, but what if you want to do something else?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI asked Jake what he wanted to do, and he couldn\u2019t remember wanting to do anything, so I had to provide some examples.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI miss fishing and walking along the beach.\u201d I said, which didn\u2019t help because I then I had to explain what a fish was and what the ocean was and why I would want to do either.\r  \n\r  \nA few moments later one of the suits arrived, \u201cJake, I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you, but your next life is ready.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nJake looked surprised and happy, but then he turned, \u201cBut, what about him and his next life? Can he come with me?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe suit shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m sorry we don\u2019t allow anyone to share their lives.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nJake appeared confused, \u201cBut what if I\u2019m not ready for the next life?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe suit appeared surprised, \u201cYou can take as long as you want.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nJake perked up, \u201cReally? You mean I can just let you know when I\u2019m ready?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe suit nodded, \u201cThere is no such thing as time here.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nJake smiled, \u201cWell then I\u2019m going to wait.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe suit looked at me and then back at Jake with another concerned look, \u201cJake, it\u2019s highly unusual for someone to pause their next life. If you\u2019d like I can-\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNope. I\u2019ve decided. No thank you.\u201d Jake said standing up.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cLet\u2019s go lose so money at the casino.\u201d Jake said and walked off.\r  \n\r  \nSo that\u2019s what we did. We lost stacks and stacks of chips until gambling felt like eating. Exhausted, we returned to our hotel rooms.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJake. You should probably go to the next life. You don\u2019t need to waste any more time here trying to find a donut that might not even exist.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nJake leaned against the wall, \u201cThe donut exists. We just have to have faith.\u201d Jake said.\r  \n\r  \nI was surprised by Jake's commitment. I think I would have gone onto the next life, but I couldn\u2019t be sure how I would behave without access to my memories.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI could never live with myself in the next life if I knew you found the donut without me.\u201d Jake said smiling and then brought me in for a hug.\r  \n\r  \nI wondered in that moment if Jake and I had ever shared other lives together. Or if this was just a quirk of fate that brought us together.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI\u2019m glad we met.\u201d I said to Jake and patted him on the back.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re a brother from another mother.\u201d Jake said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHow did you remember that saying?\u201d I asked. Jake thought about it. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 maybe there is a glitch in the\u2026.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAnd we both said it together, \u201cMatrix.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nWe parted ways to lay on our beds wide awake. I thought back to my previous life and all the things I wanted to do. I wanted to be rich and famous.\r  \n\r  \nAnd yet, here I had as much money as a anyone could ever want and I didn\u2019t care about any of that anymore. And fame, well, fame only mattered if it meant someone would love me. I knew that strangers could never love me.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then I thought about Emily. The only woman I had ever loved. I wondered if she was happy back on Earth. If she married the tennis coach she was dating. I took up tennis at the age of ten just to be around her.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cShe probably doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m dead\u201d. I said out loud.\r  \n\r  \nNobody answered of course, but I knew they were listening. Maybe getting a good laugh at my expense.\r  \n\r  \nI decided to visit the office as soon as I was tired of laying awake and find out why my life hadn\u2019t been sorted out.\r  \n\r  \nWhat would have been the next morning if there was such a thing as time, I sat in the waiting with Jake. I told him there were more interesting things to do than waiting for me, but he told me that sitting in a waiting room was more entertaining to him that losing money or eating.\r  \n\r  \nSo, we sat and stared at everyone else who was waiting.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDoes anybody here remember their past?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\r  \nEveryone seemed surprised that I was talking. \u201cUm, are we supposed to?\u201d A young man with red hair and goatee asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNo. You\u2019re not supposed to remember, but something tells me you probably had an interesting life.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHe didn\u2019t say anything. What could he say? He couldn\u2019t remember.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cHe remembers everything.\u201d Jake said, pointing at me.\r  \n\r  \nAnd suddenly everyone was fascinated. For the rest of the wait I answered question after question about my past.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, my number came up, \u201c1,244,344,434,343,332,434,334,333,333\u201d. I had to double check it a few times.\r  \n\r  \nJake stayed in the waiting room while I sat down with a suit in a nearby office.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMr., um, sorry you name isn\u2019t in the file since we cannot locate it.\u201d The suit said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMy friends call me Randy.\u201d I said, realizing that it was the first time I\u2019d said my name the entire time I\u2019d been here.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cRight, Randy. How can I help you?\u201d The suit asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve been here for what seems like a long time. I realize there is no time, but if we base it on the pounds of food I\u2019ve eaten or maybe the stacks of chips I\u2019ve lost. It\u2019s been a very, very long time.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe suit didn\u2019t say anything.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIs there a manager I can speak with?\u201d I asked politely.\r  \n\r  \nThe suit appeared confused, \u201cWhat\u2019s a manager?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI then explained how the bureaucracy on Earth worked. This seemed like a foreign concept to him. He had no manager and no underlings. It was a miracle anything got done at all.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo how did you get this job?\u201d I inquired.\r  \n\r  \nThere was a long pause and I knew what was coming, \u201cI don\u2019t exactly remember. I mean, I think I must have been picked or maybe I volunteered?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI decided to refocus the conversation.\r  \n\r  \n\"I'm looking to resolve a mix-up,\" I continued, trying to steer the conversation back to something productive. \"My cousin and I... our files got tangled up, and I'm still here waiting for it to be sorted out. I was hoping to, you know, move on to whatever's next, or at least understand what my options are.\"\r  \n\r  \nThe suit nodded slowly, tapping on a device that didn't resemble anything I had ever seen. \"I see. Well, the issue with the mix-up is a bit above my... I suppose, 'pay grade' would be the term? Though, we don't really use currency here. Let me see if I can find someone\u2014or something\u2014that might help clarify your situation.\"\r  \n\r  \nMy mention of wanting to speak with a manager had seemingly triggered a protocol, as the suit stood up and motioned and I followed him. We walked through a series of corridors that seemed to loop in impossible ways, eventually arriving at a room filled with what appeared to be floating orbs of light.\r  \n\r  \nAnd beneath the orbs of light was a small Shetland pony.\r  \n\r  \n\"This is the closest thing we have to a 'managerial' entity,\" the suit explained. \"You can present your case to Memphis.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe suit left me with Memphis and we stared at each other.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou\u2019re a horse?\u201d I said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cA pony, to be precise, but I get that a lot.\u201d Memphis answered, swishing her tail.\r  \n\r  \nThere was an uncomfortable silence as I attempted to make sense of this moment.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI guess you were expecting a donut?\u201d Memphis said, and then snorted.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo you\u2019ve been listening to me this while time?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s my job to listen.\u201d Memphis said and began pacing around the room.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little ridiculous that you\u2019re a \u2026 pony?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMemphis nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s a long story, but trust me\u2026 I\u2019m much nicer as a pony.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI wondered how I was going to explain any of this to Jake.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cListen, we\u2019re working on fixing everything for you. These kind of errors are extremely rare.\u201d Memphis said, laying down on what looked like white throw pillows for ponies.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cSo you have all the answers?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDepends on your question. If it\u2019s about this place I have most of the answers.\u201d She said, using her snout to adjust the pillows.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cOkay, what is this place and what am I doing here?\u201d I asked, wondering if I should scratch her behind the ears.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThink of it as a supernatural hotel meets airport.\u201d She answered whimsically.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAnd the casino?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nMemphis smiled a wide Shetland pony smile, \u201cWe tried a lot of things before we settled on the casino.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nNow I was the one pacing the room. I wanted answers to so many things, but I wasn\u2019t sure where to start.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019ll make it up to you.\u201d Memphis said, a moment later a hologram of my life appeared.\r  \n\r  \nIt was me and Emily playing tennis, \u201cShe\u2019s cute I can see why you like her.\u201d Memphis said, \u201cEven if she is a bit of a princess.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIf you have access to my life, why can\u2019t you just send me back?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\r  \nMemphis laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to explain, but some things are computationally irreducible.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI had no idea what she was talking about, but before I could go on a tirade she had another moment of my life playing.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as just sending you back to a particular moment. Each series of events is unique and builds on endless other moments leading up to it.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI watched as my father sang me to sleep in a rocking chair singing a lullaby.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAm I really dead?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYes and no.\u201d Memphis said. \u201cDeath as you would define it, definitely no. But death was we define it, yes.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWho is we? The bureaucrats who run this place?\u201d I asked.\r  \n\r  \nMemphis was back up pacing.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe are a collective of beings who manage the transitions, the overlaps, the in-betweens of existences.\u201d Memphis said matter-of-factly.\r  \n\r  \nThe next hologram filled the room showing countless Earths and galaxies.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt's not a bureaucracy in the way you're thinking. More like a network, a system that balances and reallocates energies and consciousness.\u201d Memphis continued. \u201cYour concept of 'bureaucrats' isn't far off, but it's more complex and less... frustrating, usually.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe hologram disappeared and it was just the two of us again.\r  \n\r  \nMemphis stopped pacing and looked directly at me, her eyes surprisingly deep for a pony's. \"Your stay here, the mix-up with your cousin, it's an anomaly, not the norm. This place, it's a waystation, a pause. For most, it's seamless, a blip. For you, it's been a bit more... extended.\"\r  \n\r  \nI had to admit, talking to a pony about existential transitions wasn't how I'd imagined my afterlife. Yet, here I was, and oddly enough, it felt right in a way I couldn't explain.\r  \n\r  \n\"So, what now? I stay here forever? Wait for some cosmic clerical error to sort itself out?\" I asked, trying to keep the frustration from my voice.\r  \n\r  \nMemphis chuckled, a sound that was strangely comforting. \"Hurry up and wait sound familiar?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI wasn\u2019t in the mood for jokes. She told me they would come and get me when they had worked out the issues and until then I should try and enjoy my stay.\r  \n\r  \nI walked out of the office and completely forgot that Jake had been waiting for me the entire time. \u201cMy God! I thought you would never come out of there.\u201d Jake said, and ran up and hugged me.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI thought maybe they\u2019d sent you back.\u201d Jake said. \u201cCome on, you took so long I\u2019m actually in the mood to eat!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAnd once again we were sitting at the buffet with empty plates stacked in front of us, but it wasn\u2019t the same. I knew this would be my last meal with Jake.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThere is something I have to tell you.\u201d I said somberly.\r  \n\r  \nJake slurped down a fork full of spaghetti with marinara sauce, \u201cWhat is it buddy?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI found the donut.\u201d I said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThat\u2019s awesome! We can find my memories and maybe we don\u2019t need to go back at all? I mean, if we can both remember what\u2019s even the point of living?\u201d Jake said.\r  \n\r  \n\"Only a person who can't remember would say something like that.\" I responded.\r  \n\r  \nI knew that if Jake had his memories he would want to go back to a life with meaning and purpose.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to replay your past life because you\u2019ve learned whatever it was you were supposed to learn. It would be like going back to kindergarten.\u201d I said, and then had to explain what kindergarten was for the next few minutes.\r  \n\r  \nIt slowly dawned on Jake that this was goodbye. I had barely finished the thought when the suits arrived.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJake, we\u2019re ready to take you back.\u201d A suit said politely.\r  \n\r  \nJake sat in silence in front of stacks of empty plates. \u201cBut I\u2019m not ready to go back.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI lifted up my hand and pointed around me, \u201cWhat else is there for you to see here?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBut the donut.\u201d Jake said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI found it.\u201d I said.\r  \n\r  \nA tear fell down Jakes cheek, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to leave you here alone.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThere was a selfish part of me that wanted Jake to stay, but I knew a true friend would never ask someone to stay in a place like this for no reason.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYou have to leave Jake, not for my sake, but for all those people you cannot remember. All the people who need you.\u201d I said, my own eyes starting to tear up.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJake, it\u2019s time to go.\u201d The other suit said.\r  \n\r  \nWe both stood and looked at each other one last time. And then Jake smiled and hugged me, \u201cI\u2019ll see you on the other side.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI waited for Jake and the two suits to disappear before breaking down into tears. I knew I would probably never see Jake again.\r  \n\r  \nI found myself back at my hotel room staring at the ceiling, wide awake. I wondered where Jake had gone and what he was doing. I thought perhaps he was a newborn child, but then there was no such thing as time. He might already be a grandfather by now.\r  \n\r  \nI thought back to the day we met, jumping from the 5th floor, and having to explain almost everything to him. I hoped wherever he was that he would find a friend that was, well, a lot like him.\r  \n\r  \nI sat in silence for what seemed like eons and then there was a knock at the door.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCome on in, it\u2019s unlocked.\u201d I said, and a suit entered.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cRandy we\u2019re ready to send you back.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI should have been overjoyed, but instead I felt numb. All I wanted was to go back and now all I wanted was closure. But closure to what?\r  \n\r  \nI stood up and followed the suit to the office. He led me through the labyrinth of office hallways until we were finally back at the office of Memphis, the orbs were still floating.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cGood news Randy, we\u2019ve fixed the timeline and everything should be as good as new.\u201d Memphis said, a hologram appearing of me in a car driving through an intersection.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cWe\u2019re sending you back to the moment you last remember.\u201d Memphis said.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBut I\u2019m going to die.\u201d I said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of that?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNone of us want a time loop, you won\u2019t be dying again.\u201d Memphis said, \u201cWell, not for a while anyway.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nThe orbs above Memphis melded until they became a portal of white light just like in the movies.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Memphis asked.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cNice touch I said as I walked toward it.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nShe smiled her big pony smile again and said, \u201cWe aim to please\u2026 have a safe a trip!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAnd a moment later I was in my car. And in the next second I could hear the crunch of metal on metal as the bus careened into my vehicle.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then I must have blacked out. When I woke up the bus driver was sitting over me. Everything was blurry and then his face came into face.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJake!\u201d I exclaimed.\r  \n\r  \nThe bus driver appeared confused; his name badge read: Jake. \u201cIs it really you?\u201d I mumbled.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m Jake. Just sit still, the ambulance is on its way.\u201d Jake said, looking around to see if the ambulance had arrived.\r  \n\r  \nI tried to sit up and give Jake a hug, but then I felt the pain in my back and laid back down.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cJake, I thought I\u2019d never see you again!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nOne of the passengers standing beside Jake looked at him, \u201cDoes he know you?\u201d\r  \n\r  \nJake shook his head, \u201cHe\u2019s delirious.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAnd then the world went black again and I woke up in a hospital bed.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMom, he\u2019s opened his eyes!\u201d I gazed down at a young boy that looked a lot like me. Beside me was a big bouquet of flowers with note from Jake that read, \u201cSorry I hit you. Get well soon!\u201d\r  \n\r  \nA moment later a blonde-haired woman leaned in and kissed me on the forehead, \u201cThank God. We thought we were going to lose you.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cEmily?\u201d I said confused. And then she leaned in and kissed me deeply.\r  \n\r  \nIn that moment I realized what Memphis meant what she said they would make it up to me.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n  \n\n\nFor more content please visit my subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cervantes\\_AI/", "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

The soft *thuds* of the wooden docks quickly gave way to a crisper *clack* of cobblestone and brick, which grew smoother the the further into the city they went.  Eventually it became a steady grind of dirt and grit.\n\nLacus wasn't sure exactly how Fariba got them out of the city.  Hiding beneath several pillows and layers of fabric did not make it easy to hear anything.  The merchant stopped the cart frequently and talked to people often, but nothing beyond muffled sounds made it to the Royal Guard.\n\nThe warm weight of the prince on his chest kept Lacus from acting brashly and following his curiosity.  If he shifted the blankets too much so he could hear, he risked alerting someone that there was more to the merchant's wares than they let on.\n\nAfter what felt like hours there was a knock on the compartment Lacus was hiding in that woke him up.  He hadn't realized he'd dozed off.  \n\nFariba lifted the pillows away and smiled down at him and the prince.\n\n\"Welcome to *not* Semperia!\" they said, reaching down and helping the prince up and out of the compartment.  Lacus stood up himself and stepped out, quickly squeezing past Secundus to get out of the cart and stretch his back.\n\n\"Right then, where the hell are we?\" he asked as he looked around.  Some trees, some grass, some hills, and the sun was rising.  *No wonder I fell asleep, we've been riding all night.*\n\n\"You are in the middle of nowhere,\" Fariba answered with a flourish of hs hand sweeping across the vista.  \"No need to thank Fariba.\"\n\n\"I wasn't gonna.\" \n\n\"Then I shall,\" the prince said, grabbing one of Fariba's hands in both of his.  He bent over and kissed the merchant's knuckles.  \"If there is anything the Royal Crown of Harenae can do for you in return for this noble service, you have only to ask it.\"\n\n\"Fariba will take great care not to waste such a favor!\"\n\n\"Maybe you should've saved that for when we made it to a town or something.\"  Lacus was scanning the horizon for any sign of a settlement.  Unfortunately the warm season was there and, though the morning was brisk, it was unlikely that anyone would have a fire lit.  No smoke to track.\n\n\"Fariba cannot do this, the situation seems to be...eh,\" the wobbled their hand side to side.\n\n\"You mean you will not stand by us from here?\" Secundus asked.  \"Abandon us in the wilderness?\"\n\n\"Fariba brought you far away from the invaders!\" Fariba threw their hands up in exasperation.  \"And you are now less than a league from a town.  Look,\" They put an arm around Secundus's shoulder and brought him around to the back of the cart.  They were just off of a barely worn trail and he pointed back the direction they seemed to come from.\n\n\"Follow this road back to a junction and turn to the northmost option.  Follow that and you will be at a small place called Aesica.  Fishing village on a lake.  They do trade with elsewhere and you can be renting or,\" he stood in front of Lacus and patted his shoulder, \"commandeering some horses.\"\n\n\"Aesica...I believe I know where we're at,\" Florus said, shielding his eyes from the rising sun.  \"We're just in the North Province.  If we can get to Coristopitum we should be safe.\"\n\n\"Yeah, your uncle should be there with a whole garrison of Imperial soldiers.\"  Lacus looked northward.  He hadn't left Semperia in several years and it wasn't like he took a holiday up north often to get the lay of the land.\n\n\"See?  All goes as Fariba plans.\"  Fariba crossed their arms and smiled with satisfaction.  \"But now Fariba must be off!  There is war and where there is war there is profit.  Should you come across Fariba's cart again, you are all welcome to reap the rewards of such profits.\"\n\n\"Gee, thanks.\"  Lacus rolled his eyes and tugged the robe.  Still wearing the white outfits that Fariba had outfitted them with, Lacus was not going to be comfortable until he could get a spear in one hand and a shield in the other.  Some armor would be nice too, but a weapon was what he wanted most.\n\n\"You are most welcome, my friend!\" Fariba said, already back on their horse.  The three of them watched the merchant roll away before turning the other direction and starting back down the road.\n\nThey spent all day walking.  No food, no water.  And no one on the road to get help from.  Though that might have been a good thing; Harenae had just been invaded.  Anyone on the road was just as likely to be an enemy soldier, and Lacus wasn't confidant of their chances unarmed.\n\nJust as the sky was getting dark they saw the town on the horizon.\n\n\"We're here!\" Florus said with relief.\n\n\"Yes, sire,\" Secundus agreed, \"but we best be careful.  We don't know if the town has been occupied or remains loyal.\"\n\n\"That's why we have these disguises,\" the prince said, pulling the white hood up over his curly hair.  Secundus and Lacus followed suit.\n\nOut at the edge of the town a pair of guards holding torches stepped into the road.\n\n\"Hold,\" one of them said in clear Haranese, \"travelers, what is your business?\"\n\n\"We've come fleeing danger,\" Florus said, stepping around Secundus and shrugging off Lacus's hand from his shoulder.  \"Has news of Semperia reached you?\"\n\nThe guards exchanged a look.  One shook his head, the other shrugged.  The first said, \"We haven't had word of or from Semperia.  Come with us and you can explain what happened.\"\n\nLacus kept close to Florus as they followed the guards to a shack that qualified as the guardhouse.  One other guardsman was in there, leaning back in a chair next to an empty prison cell.  He stood up and saluted the two that entered and gave the rest of them a quizzical look.\n\n\"Go out and keep an eye on the South Road,\" the now obviously leader of the guards told the confused one.  He nodded and went out the door, leaving the three travelers with the two, more senior guards.\n\n\"Your clothing is foreign to these parts,\" the mustachioed leader said, \"Where have you-\"\n\nPrince Florus pulled his hood down, shaking his hair out, and silenced the guards with a look.  Both took to a knee immediately.\n\n\"Whelp, looks like they're loyal,\" Lacus said as he pulled his hood down also.\n\n\"Your Majesty,\" the bare-lipped guard said, \"you grace us with your presence.\"\n\n\"Please, stand,\" Florus said.  He had a regal tone but Lacus knew he struggled with it; the prince didn't have any appetite for ruling.  He genuinely wanted to be a gardener.  Of course, the pampered man had no idea what gardening actually entailed since most didn't have a small army of servants to help with it, but the Royal Guard kept that opinion to himself.  His tone was enough for the guards to obey, at least.\n\n\"Semperia was attacked,\" Secundus said, \"the enemy may be headed this way.  We need to get the prince to Corstopitum; can you lend us some horses?\"  Though it was a question, nobody in the room confused it with a request.\n\n\"Yes, sires,\" the mustachioed guard said, \"but riding at night in these parts is dangerous.  There are wolves in the wood and bandits on the road.  If you can wait until morning we would be honored to send you off at first light.\"\n\n\"That would be most welcome,\" Florus said.  \"Have you an Inn or-\"\n\n\"I think it best we keep your presence here under wraps, my Lord Prince,\" Secundus cut in.  \n\n\"What? Sleep here in the jail cell?\" Lacus asked.\n\n\"We don't know the extent of the enemy's eyes and ears.  If someone sneaks off in the night and tells them that the heir to the throne is here, what do you think would happen?\"\n\n\"Your guard is right, Your Majesty,\" the guard captain said.  \"Stay here for the night.

But they wouldn\u2019t listen. They wouldn\u2019t listen to a little girl whose mother had just been eaten.\n\nI tried and tried to get them to see the evidence I had collected along with my eye-witness testimony. But they didn\u2019t. They waved me off as a traumatized teenager.\nSo I made them listen.\n\nChapter 4:\n\n\u201cDish out the food. Now!\u201d My boss told me the day before.\n\n\u201cCustomers are waiting. Hurry!\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t listening.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that thing they say about revenge?\u201d I mumbled to myself.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201d\n\nI snapped back to reality.\n\n\u201cSorry sorry. I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\nThe food I was meant to serve was cold. The customers complained.

I had to be patient. I had to bide my time.\n\nThere was an expression for this I had been trying to recall, to no avail.\n\nThe police let me stay in my late mother\u2019s house temporarily until they found a better place for me to live in. They also told me that I was the intended target but that my mother  had saved me by making a deal with the cannibal and sacrificing herself. So I was alone in my cavernous house and guilty for my mother\u2019s death, waiting to be moved to somewhere else.\n\nLuckily, the police wouldn\u2019t need to look far to find me a place to live if I failed.\n\nThere was a psychiatric hospital right across town.\n\nChapter 6:\n\u201c\u2014served with French fries.\u201d I was describing a meal to a horrified customer when my boss called me back.\n\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d My question did not please him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, why?\u201d but I was smiling. It was just as I had planned.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been telling customers the hamburger was made with human meat!\u201d\n\nSo I left, happy. \n\nChapter 7:\n\nCold water ran over my head: a refreshing shower. I was smiling maniacally under the freezing cold.\n\nA cold I would soon be in for a long time.\nI had the bottle and I was ready. The poison was meant to kill ravens, saturating their body so when vultures came to gobble them up, they would die as well.\n\nTwo birds. One stone.\n\nI was in front of his house, a crazed look in my eye.\n\nThe bottle became empty as his last meal became full of poison.\n\nWhy am I doing this?\n\nBut I had already gone too far. The bottle had already been used.\n\nI rang the front door.\n\nHis footsteps were approaching when it came to me.\n\nI cackled:\n\n\u201cREVENGE IS A DISH BEST SERVED COLD!\u201d\n\nThe door swung open, but it was too late; his meal had already gone cold.\n\nI hope you guys got the plot twist. When I showed it to some people they thought that the twist was that the girl was the cannibal but I intended for it to be that she went to the cannibal\u2019s house and killed herself with the poison so he would eat her and die as well.\n\nAlso, I included a secret message in the story.

Jimmy went downstairs and made himself some lemonade and saw that his little sister Harley was watching the Channel 89 news. \n\n\"Well Glidia.\" The obese news man chuckled \" Another Psychopath escaped from *Saint Bill Bills home for people who think that they are foreign royalty* what are your thoughts\"  The Girl looked at the screen looked really uncomfortable for several seconds before passing out. \n\nWhen Jimmy went back up to his room he was still thinking about what he had seen on the news.

Suddenly Jimmy's grandpa coughed up several pinto beans.\n\n\"Who is that!?!\" Grandpa Bean was pointing at king paul who was now putting up *Vote PAUL II* signs in the living room.\n\n\"No one.\" Jimmy lied. \n\n\"Whaa wha... wh-\" \n\n\"Bye Grandpa. Gotta save the mayor.\" Jimmy and King Paul II slipped out the back door and started toward the forest as they were taking a short cut so they could show up at the princess costume store before the mayor. \n\nIn the woods Jimmy ran into his imaginary girl friend Crystal who was the Princess of Ontario. \n\n\"Jimmy what are you doing in the woods?\" \n\n\"I'm off to save the mayor what are you doing?\" \n\n\"Couldn't find my castle.\"\n\n\"Did you check Ontario?\"\n\n\"Oh no I guess not. Can I walk with you two.\" \n\n\"Sure\" Jimmy smiled, and the three walked deeper into the forest.  Eventually the trees began to thin and there it was the princess costume store. There was a crowd and just up the road the mayor's car was coming into view. \n\nJimmy and his friends began searching the crowd when King Paul spotted and grabbed young Cherry Wood. The crowd was screaming at the King and he had taken out a sword and was stabbing anyone who got near him. Suddenly the mayor's car pulled up and several body guards clambered out. \n\n\"En Guarde.\" Chuckled the King before quickly cutting down all five large men with his bent sword. The King then knocked out the mayor's  driver and placed the girl in the back of the mayors car. Jimmy sat in shotgun and the two princesses and the mayor were sitting in the back two of them crying overcome by senses of fear. \n\n\"To the police department.\" Jimmy instructed the king who didn't seem to be listening. Jimmy glanced at his mirror and saw police cars trailing them. Suddenly a massive pit formed in his stumache as he turned to look at the deranged driver of the car.\n\nWithout thinking for a moment Jimmy grabbed the sword from the king and the king tried to grab it back but in his absense from the steering wheel the car had veered far of course and suddenly and powerfully hit a light post.

The fibers of this rope started to fuse with my skin long ago. Blisters that burst are forming again on top of the ever expanding infection. My hands are smouldering, swollen, and disfigured. It fucking hurts but I don't let go, not yet. \n\nI've been on the edge for as long as I can remember. Fragile and swaying in the wind, leaning towards what I know is right but then disintegrating. Drifting in the wrong direction with ease, footsteps fading to nothing behind me as I go. This life materialised so fast, leaving twenty one years of characteristics, perceptions and abilities in its wake. \n\nI hate this 'home' that we built, this den of iniquity. Chemicals cling to human shaped hallows in walls once filled with so much promise. Walls that have seen it all; blood soaked clothes discarded with haste, handcuffs secured through stifled screams and possibly for a transient moment, love. \nNow, everywhere my tired eyes land, a dimly lit movie plays in my mind. A personal premiere behind the glass of my eyes, showing reruns of passcode protected videos that I was never meant to see. My tailbone grows numb from prolonged contact with the floorboards. I refuse to sit on the sofa knowing what has happened there, so I seek comfort in the corner, curious what luminol and a UV light would reveal. \n\nDid it begin this way? It couldn't have. I would never knowingly intertwine my fingers with or admire a thing that mutilated me and eventually became the noose that snapped my neck.\n\nAll I had was slowly stripped away as week by week, finger by finger I lost the ability to grip anything but the rope. Surprisingly sensitive at first, soft to the touch. A charming and charismatic caricature of everything I thought love was. Maladaptive daydreams seemed to have manifested into a captivating presence that drew me in like a moth to a flame. I never saw naivety in my reflection, but I suppose a naive person wouldn't. \n\nVulnerability leaked out from behind a thin veil of deception. Words were strategically structured, organised carefully into fabricated floods of fiction that soaked into various hotel carpets as quickly as they did my psyche. Drinking every drop, I let the lies mix with my blood. Altering my DNA, changing what it meant to be me. \n\nAn intuitive understanding that something extraordinary loomed thick in the air. Drawing me in, with an intensity both exhilarating and overwhelming. Heavy like a boot on my lungs but not enough to warrant coming up for air. Blinded by belief, I simply endured shallow breaths with a fleeting smile. \n\nTranscending the boundaries of individuality and merging lives, the ropes grip tightened. Living became only holding on and being held on to, as I transformed into a tangible ghost unable to cast gaze without consequence. \n\nPainfully aware of subconscious intentions but irrationally confident I'd be the only exception to the rule, I held on. I would discover tiny specs of light in the darkest crevices and convince myself they were enough. \n\nComprehending time proved impossible. Not at all helped by sweet, sickly smoke filling my lungs and corrosive liquid simultaneously relaxing my nervous system and inhibitions as each day I forced myself uncomfortably into the shell of who I once was. \n\nThe newly formed burns spread from my hands and consumed my body, soon complemented with bruises; like a banana dropped and discarded on the school playground, leaving tender reminders of the darkness that could touch me at will. \n\nDissociated eyes would reject the reflection before them; seeing, studying, but not understanding. Frankenstein's addict stared back. Protruding collarbones fixed below a vacant expression that was framed by murky, watercolour bruises. Stitches that should have been removed still remained, the flesh beneath them bulging in a mangled heap as it healed. \n\nI crawled all that way, through deafening screams, vivid hallucinations and shattered relationships to give the only parts of me that remained, but eyes were focused elsewhere. Inquisitive brown eyes that I once imagined would grace my children's faces, drained of life and colour until a sunken and penetrating obsidian stared back at me. Eyes that often revealed more truth than the lips they share a face with, prone to untruths and incoherent rambling. Void of any acknowledgement, guilt or remorse, hurtful combinations of words that formed into false accusations came from those same lips that once called me their angel.\n\nThe cycle repeated as my grip tightened. What was once effortless discussion came to be digressive, circular conversations, formulated to confuse and oppress. The realisation that it would never be what it was washed over me, filling my lungs, drowning me. Fragmentary flashbacks plagued my mind as if the walls were projecting. Unable to avoid reliving my lifeless body convulsing on the floor as another nameless throwaway was violated in my home; or gasping for air, choking on showers of gold following being drugged unconscious. \n\nThe privilege of carefree ignorance morphed to hypervigilance. Vacant, bloodshot eyes struggled to keep focus but were never permitted relief. Self designated lookout for genuine threats, all the while plagued with paranoid preaching. Hallucinated ideologies presented as certainties, distracting the hands on the wheel. Burning rubber to escape rotting flesh, reminders of the past and a guilty conscience. Discombobulated thoughts escaped into the night as consciousness waned and the steering wheel veered. The second I closed my eyes it was inevitable.\n\nFragments of glass pirouetted before surrendering to the road beneath, singing a deafening tune as they fell. Metal from two vehicles mangling into one accompanied the shattering song. A raspy symphony performing to an otherwise uninhabited street. \n\nDigital footprint rapidly disintegrating along with my sense of self, those who were once close started to notice. Approaching with hesitant familiarity, they were met with detachment, silence or lies. Maintaining my hold on the rope required distance. I soon realised insistence on hiding both what I had done and what had been done to me required complete isolation. We know misery loves company, so shame and worthlessness followed. \n\nVeracious and desperately devoted was not sufficient, leading the heavy door of home to be closed in the face that once resembled my own. I attempted to claw my way back in, severing nails from their beds as they gouged through wood and I yearned for normality. \n\nStripped of clothes and all remaining dignity I was back on the wrong side of the door. The cost of a key was no higher than expected. Exploitation, confusion and the patronising offer of food in my own home, from a stranger who had been in my bed, were just another Wednesday. \n\nWith one more blatant betrayal dismissed, monotony endured. Parts of me were dying, decomposing and falling from bone. The more I made an effort to grasp the ungraspable concept that I had got it wrong, the more I rotted. \n\nThreats to abandon me on the emergency stop lane became real as the indicator clicked. A place where ear splitting engines and lack of light ensured nobody could possibly sense I existed. Ankles locked around a headrest, the only obstruction between me and the peril of being deserted in the dark. The rope intricately intertwined with my body dragged over my skin. Resistant to the force tearing us apart, adrenaline took charge. Arms flailing, lungs expanding inhumanly as I screamed; I got it my way. \n\nThe cost? A closed fist tearing tissue against my teeth like butter. Skin and muscle separated as an almost imperceptible liquid slipped through my mared fingers, and I slipped into shock. White shoes submerged with surrealistically red liquid, transforming before my emotionless eyes like a fucked up Cinderella. Platelets decorated the leather interior and dripped from the crack where my skull made impact with the windscreen. Unable to form a sentence though immediately imagining an excuse, I waited.\n\nShock diminished as I was hurtling back down the motorway with a lifelong disfiguration and a perfectly painted picture of what my life had become. Deception and quick thinking, despite a concussion, saw me discharged with 4 sutures inserted to oppose the edges of my lacerated lip. Promises were made, a half-hearted apology issued; and 48 hours passed before the cold, familiar glass of the passenger side door split those stitches right open. \n\nOrnamentation of the bathroom tiles matching the indents on my knees, I prayed to a God I was deceived into believing existed. Imploring an imperceptible force to end it all and place me in the icy arms of my mother. \n\nEach time paranoia was presented as fact a small cut was made in my skin. Tiny incision after tiny incision until pieces could be peeled away. My outward appearance reflecting the horror within. Tightly wound muscles tensed involuntarily, causing my anxious body to jerk around like I was the lead actress in a horror movie. True to the script, I pleaded, begged and screamed but mercy wasn't an option. \n\nI paid in blood to be here, so why should I leave? Why should I distort my triangular self to push through a spherical exit? Is it truly a way out if you're not yourself when you make it?\n\nThere was no time to contemplate before I registered the rope I held on to so tightly was now restricting my airway. A personalised noose, hand crafted to perfection and slipped over my head so gradually that I barely noticed. Realising my grip was unsustainable, I finally let go.\n\nWith nothing but my shell and those lustreless obsidian eyes in the room, the crack of my neck ricocheted off the walls as I dropped. An emphatic echo, distinctive and final.\n\n\u2022 @leash.pdf \n\n", "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

He was clad in a dark Leaden armour, holding his mighty sword he was reminiscing over the battles he had won. \"Perhaps this one is the greatest war in my life\" said he to himself.  It was indeed so!, as this was the infamous war over Cartghan valley between the Kronolians and Isenians.  The former being Marcus' land, where there was seldom a person who thought of him as anything less than a hero.  Such was this great general of ours.  \n\nBut his past! Only God knows how damned it was!  Marcus was born in a small village in Cartghan valley.  He was just a boy, unaware of all the sorrows of this world until they came - countless troops of the Isenians.  They made no warnings of any sort, just slaughtered everyone and burned every house that exclaimed their sight.  The ever-peaceful village soon turned into a genocidal hell.  Some villagers tried to counter these hell-hounds, their leaders were the parents of Marcus.  They were ultimately killed by the outnumbering troops.  For Marcus parents, death was a far better alternative than what they had to endure.  They were tortured, humiliated and to make it worst of all the cruelties in human mind, their little girl was thrown into a scorching house just in front of their eyes.  Marcus can never forget those screams haunting his mind.  He was sure to fall in the hands of these murderous devils, if it wasn't for his master's ingenuity and bravery.\nNow, Marcus' life is driven by his will to regain the lost  territories and make the Isenians doomed to a fate even worse than these folks from his boyhood.  He vowed his life to redeem all that is lost .....or so he thought.  One thing still plagued him though, it was his sister, whom he had been so closely associated that he couldn't imagine to lose her.  \n     \nThe great war broke out, the odds were against Isenia as Marcus' army had more soldiers and that too were well-trained.  The sky was shining crimson as if to witness the approaching clash of swords and spears. General Marcus' eyes burst with rage and much awaited vengeance.  He raised his sword and said, \" For the Kronolia, brothers, for those ancestors of ours, who were slained by these cowards\". His troops marched like a gang of Hornets on an intruder. His soldiers easily invaded the first line of defence and then deeper straight towards the heart of the army. Within an hour, few Kronolians and far too many Isenians fell dead upon the ground.  The battle was nearly over, when suddenly, what seemed to be, countless number of carts loaded with the the Isenian infantries enter the battlefield.  So this was an ambush ! , the Kronolian forces still held equal in figures but they too tired from all these commotion.  The battle was gradually turned into a massacre of both troops.  The ground turned all crimson and shiny, never shall this land forget such a clash of blood and iron.\n\nThe war was ended with the death of all, save few, who were crippled for their lives only to die their withering hopes away.  But our brave general survived.  ''How could death take someone whom despair loved so dearly ? ''  One by one, sword by sword, his comrades fell dead and he could do nothing but just witness the slained martyrs.\n  \nI need not say that words can't be deemed worthy to describe his emotions.  Marcus was a strong man, he still is, but what could strength probably do in the matters of utter delicacy.  He closed his sword upon the scabbard, his sword was certainly his sole companion.  Marcus set out and marched instinctively.  He didn't know where he was going nor did he want to.  \n\nIt were probably hours if not days, that he was on his whimsical journey.  He then entered into a familiar sort of village which had but no inhabitants. Then as if out of nowhere, he was knocked back into sanity. He saw a scorching house with a girl inside it, who was seemingly waiting someone. Almost instantly he ran towards the house.\n\nThe king was anxious to greet his loyal general who had brought him nothing except triumph and glory.  He sent out the best of his spies in search of the lost victor.\n\nTheir results were, as it seemed not fruitful, they found Marcus' armours with exception of his sword and nothing about his whereabouts.  All that was achieved was a rather ridiculous story.\n\nOne of the spies reached a strange village, on a scorched house where under a nearby oak tree these armours were found.  On enquiring an elder from a caravan, '' Oh ! That village was not lived sir.  But near that house was a girl.''\n   \n''Anything more you can say ?'', asked the spy.\n\n''Ah ! Yes sir, on my asking she told me her name, it was, Helga Redblack.''", "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

Maybe it was the headache, the kind that creeps up your neck when you haven\u2019t slept well in days. Or maybe it was the pain in his gut - but some scavenged breakfast this morning could fix that.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t spoken since the early morning hours, and it might be better all the same. What had she said? While he racked his memory, he matched her glossy stare for a brief moment. Vacant, but on the edge of a word. They weren\u2019t looking at one another, they were looking at nothing at all. Or maybe everything - how did they get here?\n\nThey were alone, for now. Running was never part of the plan, but neither was being caught. It was a victimless crime. The money didn\u2019t even belong to anyone. Or it was insured. He guessed it didn\u2019t matter - he needed it, she needed it, and the pawn shop would be fine without it. After all, how much had it stolen from them these past two years? Just a drop in the bucket for the shop, but lowball after lowball it had drained them of anything worth buying, worth keeping. Yes, they had taken the money - but what\u2019s the word - \u201cduress.\u201d What else were they going to do? \n\n\u201cIn this economy?\u201d That was the joke. For the average millennial, this meant less, but enough. For him, it meant a layoff. It meant more job for less money. It meant \u201cthank god we didn\u2019t have kids.\u201d Maybe they never would. It meant a deep kind of self-loathing because, after all, it was his fault, right? For her, it meant a veil of optimism. It meant working a whole lot harder than he did. And for what? Enough for the bus fare, enough for the same food every meal. Neither believed they\u2019d get out. They hadn\u2019t fooled the IRS, collections, not that slimy rodent at the pawn shop, and not even themselves. \n\nIt was the eviction that did it. Not the notice, they knew that was coming. But the escort out of the complex that they prayed wouldn\u2019t come. Now, here was a crime. And they weren\u2019t the only victims - how could anyone keep up with double the rent and half the money. It was like a screwed-up social experiment. And they failed. \n\nThey left most of it all, the junk in the apartment. It was the only protest they could think of. \u201cIt\u2019s yours to clean-out,\u201d he had snapped, without even the slightest bit of satisfaction. He had tried not to cry, and being an asshole was his best defense. This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen to him. \n\nShe hadn\u2019t cried, and she wasn\u2019t crying now. He didn\u2019t know if he loved her or hated her for that. Was it because she was strong? Or resilient? Or had a plan? Or (more likely, in his mind) she wasn\u2019t surprised he\u2019d landed them in this position. Maybe she had already done her crying. \n\nThey had nowhere to go. \n\nIt was mostly a silent little journey, the one each took in their head. Can\u2019t afford to go to work, not without a home to come back to. Not going to the shelter, absolutely not. Nothing left to sell, but they needed cash. The shop had cash. The shop had cash that it shouldn\u2019t have. \n\n\u201cI know we can get in there,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cit just has to be fast.\u201d \n\nDark, quiet. 30 minutes of toiling at each door. A crowbar meets glass, and the alarm shatters the silence. No money in the register. Where is the money! Office is locked, and the doorframe won\u2019t give. The glass case for the jewelry won\u2019t break. The alarm goes on. Every impulse in his body tells him they need to leave, but his head disagrees. They can\u2019t leave empty handed. \n\nOutside, it\u2019s not the police who have arrived first. The shop has dealt with break-ins. \n\nThey did leave empty handed. The back door was much easier to clear, from the inside. Shots rang out anyway, lots of them. No one pursued. \n\nDidn\u2019t need a key to enter the old apartment complex, so they just sat in the courtyard, on the ground with their backs on opposing walls. They still sat there, as the sun was coming up. They didn\u2019t find somewhere to sleep, and didn\u2019t need to at this point. \n\nWhat did she think of him, now? Did it matter? Maybe they\u2019d get help. Maybe she didn\u2019t need help anymore. \n\nHe had known the truth for hours, he could see it in the way she breathed. She had been shot too. Except worse. Too many questions to go to the hospital, and get fixed-up for what? \n\nSo they sat there, and waited. It was security that gave them the nudge once the working day had started. \n\nHe struggled to his feet, gave her a kiss on her cold forehead, and left for the bus stop. \n", "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

Of the rare occurrence came wild beasts of many sizes, of which imbued fear on the common man have visited us, though very sparingly, fortunately. Thank Yudliil for his blessings.\n\nMy brother-in-arms Jorji has led us through and has given me hope for a better future. Vast green pastures next to a tall rocky mountain have been the place we decided to call our homes. Chopping wood was a job fit for my brother Erihk, whilst Popa and Cyriv were put in charge of food, Popa hunted as Cyriv foraged.\n\nThe rest built houses while I was busy myself burrowing through the mountain with a pick in hand. My mind wanders waiting for the rest of the clan to forge through the pass.\n\nAlas, it was not always Yudiils plan for us to have steady progress. Winter has come much faster than we would have liked, we woke up buried in snow, our progress halted and the men ill. We took shelter on what little I dug through the mountain, shivering men eager for what little future yet had it taken away.\n\nWe of little strength had lost hope and our clan was on the verge of ruin...\n\nYet I who carried what little hope raised my arms and started to work on the mountain. If we can\u2019t live above, then we must do so below. Digging through the tough rocky Mountain singularly quickly sapped my strength. Yet hope ever so little has never left my being.\n\nWith every hit I shed a drop of blood, every rock mined is a sweat worthwhile.\n\nSoon my brothers saw my plight, some were skeptical, those who have given up on the future lay down on the floor powerless against their minds, others with similar hope, eyes slowly shining and with uncertainty asked me...\n\n\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d\n\nA glint in my eyes made their hopeful hearts waver,\u201d I do not bring ruin, I bring an unknown future. We either live through this hell or die trying, so you either lay down like the rest or... mine this God damned mountain beside me!\u201d\n\nMost if not all of them were shocked at my outburst yet still with a shimmer of hope began picking the walls of this uncertainty.\n\nBut soon food was dwindling, the good-for-nothing men picked not the walls but our morale, and what little food we had was shared in vain. Men were dying, we once again are losing hope.\n\nStill, spring came early as winter came past, and our magnificent dirt fortress has nearly come to fruition. I built what muscle the food I ate gave me, what strength no matter how little it provided.\n\nWith finality I glanced around, my men and brothers smiling back. We have accomplished what others have not, and despite all the hardships, we have reached the end, and with this, I feel complete, what others may find fruitless I find fulfilling.

It knows not whether it goes up or down; it only knows that it goes where it is not now; it is always going somewhere, when it is not at standstill. A pale young man stands before the gates of heaven and a glowing red button is at his fingertip.\n\n\n\nAs the lift wakes from its slumber a man on the fourth floor, the top floor of the building, stumbles drunkenly around, holding a bottle of cognac and a pen - he wears a white net T-shirt and blue pajama trousers with red stripes and incongrously a top hat, like someone coming from a New Years celebration, but it is not a day of any note in the calendar; just a humdrum Tuesday. His name is Kalinder Jones.\n\n\n\nAs soon as the button was pressed, the occupant of the first floor, a guardian angel to most, Cereberus to some, Mrs. Murgatroyd, looked out her spyhole with her beady left eye and looked to the lift; she listened to the movement of the lift, the swinging of the doors as others listened to the news of the stockmarket; was it going up or down? She saw the pale young man in his dark suit polishing his glasses nervously as the lift jumped into life and thought about old times in the country when the young men dressed in their best Sunday suits and came to the hall to dance the polka while the accordion swung in the big, horny hands of the swarthy foreigner.\n\n\n\nThe lift started to descend and on the second floor a young woman heard it between reps; she was lifting heavy weights, her huge biceps sweaty and glistening. She put the weights down and went to the sink and poured herself some milky gray water.\n\n\n\nOn the third floor was the elderly person whom the young man was going to meet. He was in front of the mirror attending to his moustache with fine scissors. He had a large magnifying mirror on one side of him and endeavoured to cut the moustache hair by hair to get the perfect shape, \u201cso it would fly off the face\u201d he always said. In front of him were big colourful jars with various waxes and smells; his moustache could smell like the bees of summer one day and the fir woods of winter another. Lieutenant Commander Wessex took care of his appearance.\n\n\n\nBut he put down his scissors as he heard the lift move and washed his face quickly and put on a puffed shirt and a uniform jacket with medals. Because now his fame beckoned and he wanted to look good.\n\n\n\nAccording to Mrs. Murgatroyd\u2018s logs, later pored over by the police, she was still at the spy hole and saw the young man enter the lift. \u00a0She kept a unofficial visitors log of the building where she wrote down particulars and theories and hypothesis about visitors and the people in the building. The police would find it invaluable but still it did nothing for them in the end.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe walked slowly in, ponderously even, none of the quick stepping youthful exuberance for this youth, the anxious rush into life, just a slow step into the future and then he turned around as we all do, as the doors of the lift started to close and he disappeared completely from my view\u201d, she wrote.\n\n\n\nThe weightlifter on the second floor, whose name was Deirdre Morningglory was taking out the trash to a small chute in the hallway and she heard the lift. Of course she had no idea who was in it, but she wondered briefly who was coming or going. The inhabitants of this building were not on a first name basis and couldn\u2019t help forming theories and fantasies about each other when they briefly met at the postboxes downstairs. Murgatroyd was not alone in that but she was the only one who knew everybody.\n\n\n\nKalinder Jones took a sip of cognac and wrote a line of text on a yellow pad hanging on the wall. \u201cOh, Morningglory, how I would like to leisure between thy thighs in dusk\u2018s delight,\u201d he wrote and then took a step back and tipped his top hat to the line. He then walked to a shelf filled with vinyl records, took out a well preserved copy of the Best of Lee and Nancy and put it on the turntable. Soon the strains of Some Velvet Morning filled the penthouse.\n\n\n\nDeirdre Morningglory was not aware of Kalinder\u2019s depth of feeling for her. She had hardly noticed him even though she had noticed that he seemed very postally inclined; he was very often down in the hall at the postboxes when she went down there. Once she had nearly attacked him as he stood behind her, lurking in a corner. She didn\u2019t notice him until she turned around from her postbox with a sheaf of letters and was so startled she jumped towards him karate-style but realized just in time who it was and stopped herself. He apologized profusely but she noticed a glint in his eye. She was back from the chute and was just now looking through her accounts. She ran a bodyguard service.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Commander Wessex stood at attention inside his flat. His narrow face was lined but looked decisive, his large and thin nose leading the rest of the face into many a battle. Behind him was a large mirror beside the window and beside the mirror was a large collection of pictures of him in uniform on the various battleships he had served on. He listened intently; his hearing was legendary in the service, some said he could hear the humming of submarines and the whisperings of sonars; whether that was true or not, he felt he had an instinct for danger and was prone to retaliating proactively, sometimes beating unsuspecting \u201cenemies\u201d who were just enjoying their drink in a bar.\n\n\n\nThe lift opened and he waited for the knock on the door, the approach of providence, his just desserts, his wonderful ascension which in the end would lead to his appearance at Ascot, invitations to manors and palaces, his inclusion in the landed set.\n\n\n\nBut the knock on the door didn\u2019t come. He had heard the lift close again. He wondered if the photographer cum journalist was waiting outside, composing himself before meeting the great and the good of the country, concentrated in his singular person.\n\n\n\nBut nothing happened so he opened the door himself, ripped it open really and peered into the hall. There was only one flat on each floor but there was a small space outside them for visitors coming from the lift and there the journalist should have been but was not.\n\n\n\nLieutenant Commander Wessex walked impatiently to the lift and pushed the button. The lift opened. It was empty.\n\n\n\nHe looked around even though there was no other way out except through the apartment.\n\n\n\nHe was puzzled. He went back in and called the newspaper. There a lady (\u201ereceptionist? Journalist?\u201c he wondered (she was actually the editor), confirmed that the photographer cum journalist had indeed been sent to his place this morning, a man by the name of Axelrod. Wessex thanked her and slammed the phone down. He walked to the lift again, still puzzled and in the end decided to go downstairs where he knocked on Murgatroyd\u2019s door. Before that he looked suspiciously around the lobby but couldn\u2019t see anything amiss.\n\n\n\nMurgatroyd opened. He looked down on her small but robust body, she looked like the middle Babushka in a set of three, her beautifully round face shone like a happy moon.\n\n\n\n\u201cCommander Wessex!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while. You must come in and have some tea.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe looked beyond her, at the colourful riot of parrots in her apartment, some sitting on the curtains, others on the back of chairs, none in their cages and declined brusquely, politely for him though.\n\n\n\n\u201cA man with a camera was coming to visit me at eleven hundred hours this morning. In fact, just ten minutes ago. Did you see him?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Murgatroyd said, looking slightly unhappy that he didn\u2019t want to come in but enlivened by being asked about a guest. A blue parrot flew over and sat on her shoulder and stared balefully at Wessex, as if accusing him of antagonism towards the whole parrot species, which was not far from the truth.\n\n\n\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d she said and went, carrying the parrot towards a table in the hall, from where she took a notebook. She opened it and turned again towards Commander Wessex.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was young, tall, thin, with dark hair, balding on top, with a large potatolike nose and a receding chin. He had wireframe glasses on, wore a dark suit and he fidgeted while he waited for the lift. He had dandruff as evidenced by a white covering on the shoulders of his suit, there was a slight bulge in his left pocket and his trousers seemed half a number to small. His jacket seemed a number to big too and unfashionable. He had a small faux-leather box hanging by a strap from his shoulder.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThat would have been his camera, yes it would,\u201d said Commander Wessex forcefully and grabbed the top of the door with his large right hand and leaned in. \u201cAnd did he enter the lift?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, he did,\u201d Murgatroyd said and continued reading from the book. \u201cHe entered the lift at precisely ten fifty five and did the turn and stared into the hallway. That\u2019s when I noticed his nose and receding chin. And yes, he had thin dark eyebrows and bluish eyes. He pushed a button, which I estimated being the button to the third floor, that is your floor. Then the elevator door closed.\u201d\n\n\n\nCommander Wessex was getting rather impatient with Murgatroyd\u2019s descriptions and slow pace of reading.\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd when did he come down again?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, that the thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice that.\u201d\n\n\n\nWessex grumbled his thanks and went back to the lift. He stopped at the second floor, went out into the small hallway and knocked on Deirdre\u2019s Morningglory\u2019s door. She opened, holding a ledger. Her icy blue stare hit Wessex where he was weakest.\n\n\n\n\u201cM\u2019am\u201d he stammered.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes, Commander Wessex.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe looked at her thin and angular face, she looked she had been drawn with as few strokes as possible and the spaces not filled in except where the was a prominent purple birthmark on her chin. It looked like a submarine to his eyes, a Russian one. Akula-class. That\u2018s the one.\n\n\n\n\u201cMs. Morningglory, a man was supposed to visit me this morning. Murgatroyd confirms that he entered the lift but he didn\u2019t arrive at my floor. Did he by any chance knock on your door?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d And seeing Wessex look, \u201cdo you think I kidnapped him? Do you want to come in and search?\u201d\n\n\n\nWessex looked beyond her at a very empty space with one table and one chair.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, of course not. Thank you.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd he walked to the lift again and went to the top floor.\n\n\n\nKalinder heard the knock on the door as he was throwing up in his tophat. He lurched like a cat and out came the remains of his eclectic dinner from last nigh; he had cooked himself great heaps of pasta and as he didn\u2019t have anything in his fridge he had added baked beans and Cocoa Puffs cereal which made for brownish vomit. He felt sick just watching it. He put the tophat away and walked to the door and opened.\n\n\n\nCommander Wessex stood there, his nose twitching. Kalinder felt him look down at him. He had always thought Wessex disapproved of him in a general way and a specific way as well. He had once barged in on him as Wessex was in his bath. Kalinder had pressed the wrong button in the lift when he was high and walked into Wessex flat which was unlocked as Wessex had just put out his trash and had forgotten to lock the door. He was very startled when Kalinder barged in, wearing a suit and holding a statue he had won at the annual TV-producer\u2019s ball for outstanding game show. That would be one thing and maybe excusable in the clear light of day but the thing was that Kalinder had seen that Wessex wore his Captain\u2019s hat in the bath and had two toy battleships with him in the water. And he was drunk enough to make fun of Commander Wessex until the latter had risen from his bath like a paunchy Neptune and thrown him out.\n\n\n\nCommander Wessex had avoided Kalinder since that episode and the few times they had met in the lift or in the foyer he became rather redfaced which was something he didn\u2019t like at all. So it was clear that he was quite upset since he deigned to talk to the \u201cburglar\u201d as he called Kalinder. He had even darkly hinted that he would go to the police and charge him but for obvious battleship related reasons he hadn\u2019t done so.\n\n\n\nWessex felt a terrible smell assail him as soon as Kalinder opened the door. He involuntarily took a step back and wondered what that scoundrel was cooking in there. He looked at the pale and ghostly thin man standing in front of him.\n\n\n\n\u201cEr\u2026 are you all right?\u201d he found himself saying even though that definitely wasn\u2019t his intention.\n\n\n\nKalinder was going to say he was all right but felt a stream of vomit entering his mouth and was silent.\n\n\n\nWessex waited for an answer but when none was forthcoming he asked:\n\n\n\n\u201cListen, Kalinder. I know we have had our differences and all that but this is very important. A young journalist was supposed to come and interview me. This is no small matter, it is a matter of the security of our nation going forward.\u201d He looked at Kalinder who was becoming very greeni. Wessex continued nonetheless.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut the thing is that he disappeared! Murgatroyd saw him enter the lift but he never came out at my floor. So my question is\u2026\u201dand now he peered intently at the greenish Kalinder with his gaze of steel, which he had rehearsed in front of a mirror when he became commander\u2026\u201dhave you seen him? A young man?\u201d\n\n\n\nKalinder\u2019s stomach lurched and he ran into the toilet leaving Wessex standing.\n\n\n\nThe centerpiece was a huge mural painted on the wall, showing Ms. Morningglory as a goddess during various times of history. Commander Wessex saw Athena, Freyja, Jean d\u2019Arc, Helen of Troy, even Betsy Ross sewing the flag.\n\n\n\nWessex heard a click. Kalinder had locked himself in the toilet. Good, thought Wessex. That blithering idiot had nothing to tell him anyway. He looked into every room of the apartment. Every surface was covered by pictures of Ms. Morningglory.\n\n\n\nHe saw an old digital camera on a bookshelf in the living room. He took it and photographed the whole goddess gallery. All his shame about the battleships in the bath had dissipated and he basked in the joy of revenge.\n\n\n\nKalinder stayed in the bathroom. Good. Commander Wessex went out and closed the door.\n\n\n\nDeirdre Morningglory was putting on her face on when someone knocked on the door again. She sighed in frustration and went and opened the door.\n\n\n\nIt was commander Wessex again, looking like a cat who had swallowed a whole creamery and kept some back for a rainy day.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d she said, a bit more sharply than she had actually intended. She was well aware that half of her face was less painted than the other.\n\n\n\nHe smiled and his clear eyes seemed to declare that he was honest as the day was long.\n\n\n\n\u201cMs. Morningglory,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know I was a captain in the navy. I commanded ships.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\n\n\u201cI became quite the connoiseur of people. And you strike me as a person of considerable resources.\u201d He looked at her and for a second she could swear he winked briefly.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat is true,\u201d she said like she was giving evidence in court. Neither more, nor less.\n\n\n\n\u201cCould you please help me to find out what happened to that journalist?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe sighed. \u201cIf that will give us some peace, maybe I will. I\u2019ll call some people from my organization. Just wait until then.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat kind of people?\u201d he asked eagerly.\n\n\n\n\u201cInvestigative types,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nHe bowed and clicked his heels. \u201cMuch obliged, Madam\u201d as the door closed.\n\n\n\nShe shook her head, made a phone call and continued painting herself.\n\n\n\nCommander Wessex took the lift downstairs and waited impatiently in the lobby. He had prided himself on his patience during the long watches at the helms of his battleships, standing for hours in the wheelhouse and looking out at the foaming sea, but now he was antsy, paced every now and then around the lobby and opened the front door at random moments. He even went and knocked on Murgatroyd\u2019s door to get some company but there was no answer. His anxiety was rising.\n\n\n\nFinally the doorbell rang. He opened the door quickly. In front of him was a plump woman with blond curly hair, dressed in a wide lapel suit.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d. He tried not to shout but the sentence which started out low gained in volume as it went on and \u201cwant\u201d was kind of a squeaky scream.\n\n\n\n\u201cAre you commander Wessex?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe felt her green eyes looked at him with judgment he wasn\u2019t altogether comfortable with.\n\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cMs. Morningglory called me. My name is Marley. I\u2019m an investigator with her organization. Can I come in?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe stepped away from the door and she walked in.\n\n\n\nMs. Morningglory wasn\u2019t sure about all the details. Can you go over them with me?\u201d\n\n\n\nHe told her about the journalist who was supposed to interview him about his stellar career and dire warnings about the situation of the country and what his investigation had turned up.\n\n\n\nAfter his explanation, she said: \u201cWell, let\u2019s talk to Ms. Murgatroyd first\u201d and he nodded and knocked on Murgatroyd\u2019s door.\n\n\n\nNo answer.\n\n\n\n\u201cHmmm,\u201d said the blonde lady who said her name was Marley. \u201cIs she wont to go out at this time?\u201d\n\n\n\nCommander Wessex couldn\u2019t imagine Murgatroyd ever going out.\n\n\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve never seen her go outside.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d Marley said. \u201cAnother thing then. What paper sent the journalist and what was his name?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHis name was Axelrod, I think and he was from the Armed Forces Annual.\u201d\n\n\n\nShe took her phone and called. She turned away from him as she talked to someone. Then she cut off the phone call and turned to him.\n\n\n\n\u201cShe confirmed that they sent him.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI know all that! I called them myself! But where is he? Why did he disappear in the lift?\u201d\n\n\n\nMarley summoned the lift and looked inside. She entered and touched every surface in the lift, even the floor and the ceiling. Commander Wessex didn\u2019t like seeing so many fingerprints on the surfaces of the lift but he curbed his disquiet.\n\n\n\nShe exited and turned to him.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat about the other people who live here?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI have talked to them. There is Ms. Morningglory, whom you know and a punk called Kalinder Jones. He is not with them. I have searched their apartments.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cOK. Then the only logical explanation is that he either left and Murgatroyd didn\u2019t notice or that he is with her.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cHer?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cMurgatroyd.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d Commander Wessex was puzzled. Why should he be with Murgatroyd?\n\n\n\nMarley went to Murgatroyd\u2019s door and knocked again. No answer. She took out a set of small lockpicking tools and started working on the lock. Wessex paced around the floor while she worked and then she opened the door and he moved to her side.\n\n\n\nThey entered and Marley called \u201cMs. Murgatroyd?\u201d in a loud voice which disturbed the parrots who started squeaking so Commander Wessex covered his ears with his hands.\n\n\n\nThey moved through the small hall where Murgatroyd usually stood. Her notebooks were on a table. Marley moved into the living room and Wessex looked at the notebooks. It was as he suspected, clear descriptions of visitors.\n\n\n\nHe put it down and moved after Marley inside the apartment.\n\n\n\nThe parrots were in a high state, some flying around others on the curtains, still others on cupboards.\n\n\n\nOne yellow and blue one flew down and sat on Wessex\u2019s head. He shook it irritably but it didn\u2019t move. It locked its claws into his scalp. A scream started for form in his throat but he curbed it successfully and just moaned loudly.\n\n\n\nMarley turned around and looked at him with disapproval. Then she flicked her finger at the parrot and it flew off. Wessex stroked his scalp and came off with blood on his hand. He looked around. There was not much in the living room. Just a small chair and a table and a TV.\n\n\n\nThey moved into the bedroom. It was small as well and in great disarray. Marley opened the cupboards. They were empty.\n\n\n\nThey heard a shriek from somewhere. Wessex thought at first it was a parrot but Marley was moving quickly through the living room and into the kitchen. There was a door there, beside the stove and she opened it quickly and moved in.\n\n\n\nThere a young man lay with his face covered in blood. Blood was flowing from a wound on his head. They looked at him, he looked at them and gurgled something.\n\n\n\n\u201cMove away!\u201d Wessex said and took out her phone and called an ambulance.\n\n\n\nCommander Wessex moved outside. Soon the foyer was filled with EMT\u2019s and policemen and everyone was shouting and asking questions and he retreated to a corner.\n\n\n\nMurgatroyd was never found but scores of bodies were found in her large walk-in freezer. The police surmised she knew the game was up when she saw the insistence with which Commander Wessex was investigating the case.\n\n\n\nCommander Wessex never got his interview and had to be content with writing furious letters to the editor of the papers, some of which were published. Later he had his own Youtube-channel. Kalinder wrote a few screenplays about a female security consultant who got into various scrapes with the Russians and the Chinese. None of them was made into a movie. Both still live in the building. Ms. Morningglory sold her flat and some thought she had disappeared on a spy mission to the Urals but in reality she opened an ashram in Florida and retired a few years later.", "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

The town residents were pleased as they were a melancholic bunch, and they enjoyed having the weather match their moods. Also, it gave them an excuse to stay home and not socialize. Goldtail was similar to most residents. \n\nOne of his caretakers had been kidnapped. Goldtail had considered joining the search, but the feline didn\u2019t want to get wet. Besides, one of the two people was competent and would find him eventually. Goldtail hoped they would get home soon and give him some fish. He could hunt for a rat, but he was feeling lazy today.\n\n\u201cHow can anyone read this?\u201d Evelyn picked up a page that Derrick had dropped as part of his literary journey. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. It\u2019s helping us find Derrick,\u201d Becca says.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t paper dissolve in water. Isn\u2019t the trail about to get cold?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt takes a lot of rain, or a long amount of time for that happen. It\u2019s a light drizzle so we need to hurry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me to hurry in bad weather,\u201d Evelyn said. The wind picked up almost ripping the papers out of Becca\u2019s hand. \n\n\u201cNo, we have to move. Paper will blow in the wind, and we may lose Derrick,\u201d Becca said.\n\n---\n\n\u201cIn my new society, there\u2019d be no storms,\u201d Lisa said.\n\n\u201cReally, and how do you propose that?\u201d Derrick asked.\n\n\u201cThrough science, Ura hasn\u2019t mastered weather control. I will make science a central tenet of the new civilization. All government shall follow the laws of the natural world.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t we already follow those rules. You don\u2019t see anyone violate the rules of gravity,\u201d Derrick said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got you there,\u201d Lionel said.\n\n\u201cWell uh.\u201d Lisa scratched her chin as she thought. \u201cThere\u2019ll be no flying. Flying is a violation of gravity.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t birds fly. Will there be no birds,\u201d Derrick said.\n\n\u201cBirds have an exception as they are animals. Humans will not be allowed flight.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you are going to be a luddite society that embraces scientific progress. Also, you want to control the weather,\u201d Derrick said. Lisa bit her lip as she contemplated the clear contradictory tenets of her utopia. After a few moments, she opened her mouth.\n\n\u201cThe laws of science shall be obeyed unless absolutely necessary,\u201d Lisa said.\n\n\u201cAnd you are going to be one who determines when that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, because I\u2019m in charge,\u201d Lisa said. Lionel leaned to Derrick.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always been clear,\u201d he whispered. Logan looked out the window smiling. He loved the \nviolence and rage of the storm. If he could, he would dance and be struck by lightning. He often imagined his claps were thunder. He was a simple violent man. Lisa still hadn\u2019t figured out how to use him in her society.\n---\n\n\u201cThis is the place.\u201d Evelyn stood in front of an old brick building in the center of the street. It was surrounded by similar brick buildings which made it the perfect hiding space. \n\n\u201cAre you sure? There may still be a page around here.\u201d Becca looked around.\n\n\u201cDo you think that matters? It\u2019s getting cold out there, and I want to go inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvelyn, the first hours after a kidnapping are the most important.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we got to a good stop pointing point. Let\u2019s go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not until we find Derrick.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, there.\u201d Evelyn pointed at the building.\n\n\u201cYou just admitted that you wanted to go inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mean that he\u2019s visible through the window,\u201d Evelyn said. Becca looked inside and saw Derrick talking to a woman. She looked back to Evelyn with disappointment in her eyes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you this, but don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell everyone.\u201d\n\n---\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that there needs to be more hot sauce,\u201d Lionel said.\n\n\u201cWhy do you care about the food so much?\u201d Lisa asked.\n\n\u201cCultures are judged by their cuisine. You aren\u2019t thinking about it enough,\u201d Lionel said.\n\n\u201cFine, I\u2019ll put you in charge of nutrition.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd taste.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d Lisa shrugged. The door knob began to rattle. Then, the whole door shook. The four people inside looked at each other. Logan walked over and opened the door. Evelyn was crouched down with a paper clip while Becca stood behind her.\n\n\u201cYou said you could pick locks,\u201d Becca said.\n\n\u201cUh.\u201d Evelyn stood up. \u201cI\u2019m a tornado.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah right. Logan grab them,\u201d Lisa said. Logan smiled and picked the women up by their shirt collars. \u201cYou were supposed to get here after I delivered the ransom note. Now who is going to meet my demands.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could let me out,\u201d Evelyn said.\n\n\u201cNot you, you\u2019d clearly sell throw these two under the bus.\u201d Lisa paced back and forth. \u201cNow, I have to come up with a backup plan. I could hold you all hostage. And take you back to city hall. It\u2019d be one to one which is bad odds.\u201d\n\n\u201cUh, there\u2019s a tornado behind you,\u201d Becca said.\n\n\u201cQuiet.\u201d Lisa stroked her chin. \u201cLogan would beat you all up, but he\u2019s an idiot who might abandon me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, seriously. There\u2019s a tornado.\u201d Derrick shook his chair until he fell. \u201cUntie me so I can cover my neck.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said shut up.\u201d Lisa leaned against a window. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m overthinking this. Only the mayor is needed, and she has the weakest will.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hardly ever agree with them, but you should move,\u201d Evelyn said.\n\n\u201cIn my ideal society, there\u2019d be no storms,\u201d Lisa said. This was not her ideal world. The tornado collided directly with the building. Lisa was crushed under the rubble. Logan cheered at the chaos allowing Evelyn and Becca to crouch down. Logan jumped in the air hoping the tornado would take him. When it didn\u2019t, he ran after it.\n\nThe tornado collision lasted ten seconds, but those ten seconds were chaotic for just that building. The rest of the block was fine. Evelyn and Becca looked around.\n\n\u201cI told you to come up with a plan for natural disasters,\u201d Becca said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still trapped,\u201d Derrick yelled.\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Becca ran to untie him. Under a nearby pile of debris, Lionel crawled out.\n\n\u201cWould you guys happen to have guacamole?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Evelyn said.\n\n\u201cDarn, guess I\u2019ll find someone who does.\u201d Lionel walked away from the cops and the mayor.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t he kidnap you?\u201d Becca asked.\n\n\u201cLet him go. He only follows his stomach.\u201d\n\n---\n\nr/AstroRideWrites", "reply_text": "**Welcome to the Short Stories!** This is an automated message.   \n\nThe rules can be found on the sidebar [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/ShortStories/about/sidebar).\n\n**Writers** - Stories which have been checked for simple mistakes and are properly formatted, tend to get a lot more people reading them.

What do you think I should do to improve it.\n\n\n\nI Love You\n\nAuthor\u2019s note:\n\nI love you.\n\nA famous line. An infamous line. Those three words have been repeated so many times, they\u2019ve been exhausted of their strength, of their vigor, of their power. They are dying. Murdered by the lies of the lovers long since passed. Even Death has grown tired of hearing them. He takes his victims before they can recite that doomed poem to spare the other of a meaningless life in search of a new purpose.\n\nI love you.\n\nWords of such great power, nearly extinguished.\n\nThey must be given back their strength.\n\nThey must be reinvigorated.\n\nThey must be reignited to become a welcoming fireplace on a cold winter's night.\n\nChapter 1:\n\nI was walking down the large street, lengthening my stride with every step. I had passed by a thousand people and didn't bat an eye, but one drew me in. One made me want to stop and enjoy the sunset together. But I was late. Late for the most important event of my life. I couldn\u2019t stop walking, and yet I did. I stopped and watched. To see you.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t mean to but I spoke out loud.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d You heard me.\n\nI turned red and looked away.\n\nI saw the way your eyes reflected the light of the dying sun like huge spotlights boring into my soul and revealing my darkest secrets.\n\nAnd I lost myself in your gaze.\n\nAnd you in mine.\n\nMy question still lingered in the air. A question I would never get the answer to.\n\nChapter 2:\n\nIt had been nearly a year since that fateful day. I see you every day now from when I wake to when I go to sleep. I had confessed my love to you several times but you had avoided reciprocating the feeling.\n\nEvery time you seemed to get close to admitting your love, you'd say the same thing to change the subject:\n\n\u201cThat reminds me\u2026\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019d had enough.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nYou looked me in the eyes and I had the same feeling as the first time we met.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\nThe room fell silent but I felt the need to scream at the top of my lungs.\n\nI walked away from you, holding back the pain and the sorrow I knew I would endure in the evening as I contemplated:\n\nWhy?\n\nChapter 3:\n\nWeeks went by with no change to our lives. As if that conversation never happened. We were both in denial walking to and from work everyday. Even your eyes\u2014the one thing I could rely on\u2014were different. They didn\u2019t have that same gleam they did on that first day. \nAs I walked down the street, I saw a lone flower growing out of a crack in the concrete. It mesmerized me with its beauty. Its odd symmetrical shape seemed to place me in a trance.\n\nI immediately picked it out of the ground, tearing out its petals one by one.\n\n\u201cYou love me. You love me not. You love me. You love me not. You love me\u2026\u201d I frowned as I picked the last petal:\n\nYou love me not.\n\nI felt a horrible sorrow engulf me.\n\nBut something else came along with it.\n\nSomething I dared not to address.\n\nSomething I hated loving to feel.\n\nRelief.\n\nRelief that my crazed mind would be put to sleep.\n\nRelief that my aching heart would finally be soothed.\n\nRelief that I finally had the strength to say goodbye.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what I did.\n\nBut at what cost?\n\nChapter 4:\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean that!\u201d\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to say that until we get married.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t be with you anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying. You\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been more sure of anything in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I love you!\u201d\n\nMaybe I\u2019m wrong.\n\nWe embraced.\n\nWhy?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, you left, slamming the door behind you.\n\nMy tears flooded my apartment; an ocean of sadness.\n\nChapter 5:\n\nNight came quickly, blanketing the earth in darkness. As I lay in bed, I thought and thought about the injustice of the world. When sleep didn\u2019t come an hour later, I stood and made my way to the kitchen where I found the medicine cabinet. I took a painkiller and then took another and another until the bottle clattered on the floor, empty. But the pain didn\u2019t go away, it only worsened, overtaking each individual part of my body one by one.\n\nMy legs failed first as I fell to the floor. The pain began creeping up my torso as I lost control of my body. My arms went numb next, flailing like fish out of water. My neck quickly followed.\n\nMy heart held on for as long as it could, beating faster and faster and faster.
