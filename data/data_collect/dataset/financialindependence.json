After some discussion I started to think about his sons time and income streams so this is what I came up with. \n\nAssume kid gets a job for $10/hr at 20 hrs per week. The $100/mo will be used towards books/materials for each semester. \n\nThe kid will sign up for a cash back credit card for a $100-200 sub to pay for the books each semester and reimburse himself from the 529. He\u2019ll keep the sub as points and when it is time for mid terms or finals, he can tell work he needs time off to study for school. He\u2019ll use the points to supplement the lost income at the time. Assuming the kid actually studies with this new found time you would imagine they could score better on the exams and thus have a higher gpa. They would then leverage this higher gpa for better internships and jobs out of college. \n\nHopefully this would also teach the kid about multiple income streams, the value of time and lower the stress of having to work and study at the same time.

Throughout the survey each section includes instructions at the top of the page as well. \r  \n\r  \nThe survey will take approximately 20 minutes to complete, depending on how prepared you are with your numbers. \r  \n\r  \nEnter all annual information for calendar year 2023 (January 1 \u2013 December 31, 2023).

You determine the number of people who contribute to your finances. Demographic questions include demographics for \"contributor 2\" and \"contributor 3\", if you have more than one person contributing to your household income, you can include their demographic information there. \r  \n\r  \nRemember that personal finance is personal.  Enter your numbers as you interpret them, personally.  If you really get stuck, I will be watching this thread and answering interpretation questions as able.  Because personal finance is personal, some buckets may not be precisely consistent with your personal buckets.  \r  \n\r  \nYou are able to return to the survey and edit your answers later if needed; just skip to the end and submit to get your return link. \r  \nThe survey will be available for the entire month of April.  \r  \n\r  \nEnter dollar amounts as a whole number, appropriately rounded.  E.G. $32,594.56 is entered as 32595.\r  \n\r  \nEnter percentages as a number, not a decimal. For example, 4% is entered as 4 (not .04), 20.5% is entered as 20.5 (not .205), etc.  \r  \n\r  \nDo *not* use symbols for dollars ($) or percentages (%).  \r  \n\r  \nAt the end of the survey, you will be asked for any comments on the survey.  If you had any confusion or issues with a question, please refer to it in your comments by the question number plus a brief description of the question (question numbers change depending on your circumstances). Because the survey does not ask for identifying information, I will not be able to follow up with you, so please be as specific as you can about the issue or difficulty you encountered. \r  \n\r  \nAlmost all questions are skippable; if a question does not apply to you or you haven't yet determined the answer, skip it.   \r\n\nThe survey will ask for an approximation of the cost of living for your area, use this [Co](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_current.jsp)[st of Living Index](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_current.jsp) and get as close as you can.

I started late in life \u2013 really feel like I JUST started taking this seriously and would love some outside opinions on my projections.\n\nI am 35F. I make a high income, but am quite miserable in my field. I am the sole income for my family of 3 (married to 45M with an 8yo son). Our goal is to save aggressively for another 6-8 years, which will hopefully allow me the cushion to leave my field and pursue something totally different, with likely a much lower income. \n\n**Finances**\n\nIncome \u2013 285k/yr\n\n401k \u2013 242k\n\nIRA (80% roth, 20% traditional) \u2013 60k\n\nEmergency fund (HYSA) \u2013 49k\n\nStocks \u2013 9k\n\n529 \u2013 6k\n\n**Debts**\n\n168k on our home worth 650k (482k equity) @ 4.7%\n\n6.5k left on vehicle @ 3%\n\nCurrently the goal is aggressively paying off the mortgage. This isn\u2019t the wisest financial decision but the mortgage is the baddie looming over my head. If that burden is gone, I will feel much less anxiety in the unlikely event I have a meltdown and quit my job. I sacrificed a lot of investment growth in order to pay off my 160k student loan debt years ago, but the weight off my shoulders has been priceless.

I know how much it costs me now, but no idea how much it would cost me in the future scenario. I am sure I am missing some things. \nI do not understand how to account for inflation and differing tax brackets.\nWe are planning to hire a financial advisor once the mortgage is finished but hoped I could get general impressions from people who know what they\u2019re doing here.

Remember, though, flexibility is key with FIRE. Anticipating higher expenses for your son and future healthcare costs is important. Not accounting for inflation and tax changes could impact your projections. A financial advisor post-mortgage is a smart move, but also consider running scenarios with inflation and different tax brackets now. This might give you a clearer picture and better preparation.

Created with\u00a0[sankeymatic.com](https://sankeymatic.com/)\n\n**Context:** We are now 6 years out of college, both with bachelor's degrees.  \nToday, I work in manufacturing, bringing in $115,000 a year, while my spouse is an engineer in training, earning $80,000. With a Master's degree almost complete, she's on track to earn even more by next year.\n\nWe started out our life after college together making a combined \\~$100,000 per year, and had $120,000 in student loans after graduating from an overly expensive liberal arts private school. It felt daunting. We chose to confront it head-on and paid it off in about 2.5 years. We funneled every spare dollar towards paying off our debt. It wasn't easy, but through discipline and sacrifice, we chipped away at our loans and became debt free.\n\nThe habits we'd formed during that time\u2014budgeting meticulously, living below our means, and prioritizing savings\u2014were invaluable. They became ingrained in our lifestyle and laid the foundation for our financial future. Now, debt-free (except for a great 2.5% 15-year mortgage) and disciplined, we're confident in our ability to build wealth and achieve our goals in the long run.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n1. Continue to focus on our careers and advance as much as possible to earn more income. Invest any additional income earned.\n2. Invest/save for a downpayment on a larger house that can accomodate our in-laws to live with us in \\~4/5 years, and have our first child around then.\n3. Have more kids after that.\n4. Take everything a little less seriously.\n\n**Other info:**\n\n* We drive a Toyota Tacoma and a Mazda Miata. In my opinion, this is the best car-duo ever. We can tackle anything with 4 wheel drive and enjoy the sun with the top down. The Miata isnt fast, but you can floor it without getting a speeding ticket.\n* All of our investments go straight to FXAIX, automated once per week.\n* We arent exactly minimalists, but we strive to not be big consumers. We do a really good job of mutually fending off each other's impulse purchase ideas. Owning less \"stuff\" and only having stuff that you love/use frequently around you is awesome. (See: Konmari Method; [https://konmari.com/about-the-konmari-method/](https://konmari.com/about-the-konmari-method/) )\n* Our Vacation budget is growing, but it's been so fun expanding what we do. We went to Japan for 2 weeks last September (and again this May!). [Going.com](http://Going.com) is an awesome resource for finding cheap flights. In September our Round trip flights to Japan were \\~$550 each.\n\nI am happy to answer any questions and hope reading this was fun or interesting.", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "BiiiiiTheWay", "comment_text": "Where do you live that your taxes are so low?

I also moved to a cheaper country that has better QoL for me.\n\n\nI can't work regular jobs, so I knew if that ever went away, I would need to make it with what I have plus hopefully some disability payments I'm applying for. I'm not going to get SS because I went the self employed route (not out of choice, but because I quickly burned out of a regular job and then was unemployed for 2 years. \n\nWhen PE bought my employer 2 years ago, I made it another year with them, then I burned out again (and they were cutting half of the devs anyway to replace them with cheap outsourcing). Even though I was prepared financially, losing the contract after > 10 years sucked, and it made me revisit my diagnosis and limitations. Mostly because I wanted to figure out what I want from life. I always had that hope that I could do so if I ever lost that job. But that introspection so far has mostly led to more depression.\n\n I can generally take care of day-to-day stuff though, so hopefully I won't need too much care until I'm very old. I'm considering to exit life voluntarily if things get too bad, tbh. If I get the disability payments for the next ~20 years, then I won't need to withdraw much until then. If I don't, then I'll be withdrawing less than 3% to compensate for not having other safety nets.\nIt sounds like your family is financially successful and there's little financial risk for you tbh. I'd probably focus on practical questions in your situation."}, {"comment_author": "MathFIRE27", "comment_text": "Yes, I think having family helped a lot (especially one that can help me physically execute investments where I need help on a phone or on a platform).

Here are my numbers", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1by7o6o/how_close_am_i_to_retirement_here_are_my_numbers/", "post_main_text": "I am turning 38 this summer and live in a HCOL area on the West Coast of the U.S. I pretty much worked non-stop at large tech corporations since I got my bachelor's in my early 20's. I'm still at a big corporation, and I honestly can't wait to FIRE.\n\nCredit Karma says my net worth is 2.84M.\n\nMy plan is to FIRE in May 2025 based on some spreadsheet calculations and a talk with a financial adviser. I would like to get a second, third, etc. opinion on how realistic that is. I understand it is a calculation but it is major milestone and wanted to get some additional thoughts on what my financial adviser's recommendations were. My adviser said:\n\n>\"The goal is to have your brokerage sustain you until age 60 when you can start drawing down from your retirement accounts. You have $483k \\[at the time, now $559k\\] in retirement accounts. If we can assume a 7% return until age 60, that would give you $2.3M in retirement and give you $91k/year in income.\n\n>Right now you need to replace $65k/year in income so if we add inflation of 3%, you would need $128k/year in income. So, your retirement balance will get you to $91k/year and your income need will be $128k/year leaving you a gap of $37k/year to cover you income needs in retirement. This is where your rental property comes in to fill the gap.\n\n>Right now your rental provides $3,300/month and in 14 years the mortgage will be paid off. If we factor in inflation for rental prices, the average inflation rate for rentals over the last 100 years has been 2.7%. If we go with an even more conservative number of 2%, this would have your rental property generating $62k/year in income.\"\n\nBasically the adviser said I need to have at least 1.3M in brokerage accounts that will hold me over to when I'm done paying off my mortgage, when I will generate more income.\n\n**Current Total Comp with my Employer:**\n\n* Base Salary + Bonus: 205K\n* Estimated value of stock vesting in next 12 months: 100k\n\n***Assets***\n\nCash:\n\n* 100K in checking/savings accounts, which includes 85K in a HYSA (going to deposit some of that into my brokerage account soon).\n\n**Brokerage/Investments:**\n\n1.06M in Betterment (100% equities/0% bonds)\n\n* US Large Cap (SPLG: 515 shares, ITOT: 2689 shares, VTV: 300 shares, VTI: 193 shares, SPYV: 925 shares)\n* US Small Cap (VBR: 315 shares, IWN: 21 shares)\n* US Mid Cap (VOE: 437 shares, IWS: 70 shares)\n* INTL Emerging (VWO: 1451 shares, IEMG: 1630 shares)\n* INTL Developed (VEA: 4491 shares, SCHF: 913 shares, IEFA: 562 shares)\n\n103K in company stock (Tech, not sharing for anonymity)\n\nHSA: 3K (I know, this is super low, starting to invest into this)\n\nRobinhood: 1.7K (mostly for fun, some FAANG stocks)\n\nCrypto: 800 (again, mostly for fun)\n\n**Retirement Accounts:**\n\n492K in Fidelity\n\n* VANG INST 500 IDX (73.72%), VANG IS EXT MKT IDX (9.25%), CSCRX 14.13%), PEQSX (2.9%)\n\nROTH IRA\n\n* VTI (51.8K), VXUS (5.5K)\n\n**Property:**\n\n* Currently living rent-free with fiance (who owns the property), we just split utilities\n* I own a condo (built in 2013) with an annoying 430/month HOA\n   * 1.068M on Zillow\n   * 281K Principal Balance, Interest Rate: 2.375%, Maturity Date: 5/1/2036\n   * Currently renting it out, which pretty much breaks even when you factor property management costs, property tax of around 9k a year (broken up into two installments)\n   * I plan on not selling this house for as long as possible so I can get \"passive\" income\n\n**Estimated Yearly Expenses is 65K when I FIRE if you include:**\n\n* Insurance: Car, Health, Umbrella, Disability\n* Mortgage (done paying in 2037): 2231.27/month + property tax + HOA\n   * Note: I break even from my rental income (rent - management fees - property tax).\n* Various subscriptions and memberships, utilities, leisure\n\n**Other factors:**\n\n* My fiance and I do not plan on having children.\n* My fiance (2.5 years younger than I am) and I are getting married later this year (yes we have a pre-nup), and they plan on working at their corporate job for at least another 3 years, possibly longer before also FIRE'ing. I figure that I could be on their health insurance plan for at least a year, and then do covered California for health insurance when both of us are unemployed. I'm aware that I could be paying over 1000 for monthly premiums depending on the plan I choose.\n* In terms of health issues, except for anxiety, which I think my work makes worse. I am doing therapy, exercising and meditating more, etc.\n* I don't actually know what I'm going to do when I FIRE, I don't really have any career interests that can be translated into any second careers. All I know is that I don't want to deal with the grind of working in Tech, but perhaps there's a side hustle I can do. I'll need to do more research.\n* I have no debts, no car payments, student loans, credit debt, etc. I paid off my car in full (2022 Electric Vehicle)\n* If it's not obvious already my numbers are in USD.\n* If I could help it I don't want to move to another area at least for another 15-20 years. I'm very happy where I am.\n\nThere are just my numbers (not including my fiance's). My fiance is in a somewhat similar position as me financially, except that due to a recent promotion they make almost twice as much money as I do.\n\nThank you!", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "Ok-Entertainer-1414", "comment_text": "I would assume inheritance to be 0 in your planning.

Regarding the emergency fund, I also have $75,000 in Roth IRA contributions that I could access if absolutely necessary. Does this seem reasonable? Currently each \"bucket\" has its own HYSA, but if I combine the funds into one taxable brokerage account investment, I'm not sure what would be the best approach to know how much of each fund is available. Any thoughts on that? Any thoughts on which total market fund to invest in a taxable account?

Once you have enough money, it all basically feels like the same pool of money and cash isn't special. With sufficient money, it doesn't really matter if you you have to sell 10k stocks at a loss *this one time*. It's better to just maximize the long run.\n\nAs per having multiple buckets at fidelity, you could actually just open multiple brokerages really easily and then change the labels like \"brokerage-car\" or something, but I think it will make tax filings more annoying. Otherwise you can have them all the same brokerage, you can have a spreadsheet that tracks how much was contributed for each bucket, then do some math on gains/losses.

This is not meant in any way to be disrespectful to you or your accomplishment, only to point out that you and most people here are looking at your \\*problem\\* through that lens.\n\nHence why most of the \\*advice\\* that is being given to you, are things like, find a life coach, or get a therapist, or a psychologist, or find your passion, or your \\*purpose\\*, yet, I'm sure you noticed, that none of these people can actually tell you why they think this is the right advice (because none of them have actually achieved any level of happiness), or when it comes to passion or purpose how to actually \\*do it\\*.\n\nThis is because they lack proper perspective. You cannot fix a problem of the soul with material approaches.\n\nI'm not some \\*guru\\* or coach or some other bs. Just a dude, living a very \\*minimal\\* lifestyle.\n\nI'm actually on the opposite side of you, where I used to make a lot of money in tech, but instead of griding away, climbing up the corporate ladder, and maximizing my investments and gains, toward financial independence, I quit, sold and/or gave away all my shit, and I mean everything, except for my computer and some clothes, and even sold my car, and decided to pursue my hobbies and meditate for hours a day.\n\nI probably shouldn't even be in this subreddit, but for some reason your post popped on my feed, so I wanted to give you a bit of a different perspective.\n\nAnyhow, the main issue you have is **a lack of \\*alignment\\*.**\n\nFirst it's a lack of alignment to self, and then a lack of alignment of self, to the rest of the universe. I know that this will sound kind of Woo Woo, and like new age bs, but it's not.\n\nThe guy above who said,\n\n>\"My first bit of advice is to spend some time moving from \"for reasons I don't understand\" to a better understanding of yourself.\"\n\nis actually the only one who is somewhat correct.\n\nIt's the only reply in this thread that is somewhat correct.\n\nHow much do you truly know yourself? Have you ever actually sat somewhere quiet all day, and just asked yourself \"who am I?\", or just sat somewhere all day an not thought about what you got to do, or what you didn't do, or what you need to do, and only focused on the present moment, where there is nothing to do?\n\nThe question you are probably asking yourself is 'How do I get to a better understanding of myself?\"\n\nYou probably won't find the answer reading his blog, as each one of us has their own journey that can only be realized via \\*direct experience\\*, via our own efforts. His journey might inspire you, but you got to figure out the direction and the reason to start in the first place.\n\nWhat I can tell you, is that you need to find something that \\*aligns\\* with that which you most desire, that which you squashed in order to reach your financial independence.\n\nWhatever your \\*inner voice\\* used to whisper to you, when you were a kid, telling you what you should be doing instead, or when you were sitting in some office in corporate, that you kept squashing, in order to keep grinding away, that is what you \\*must\\* do now.\n\nYou got to basically \\*self express\\* your inner most dreams and desires. You also need to \\*create\\* as a form of expression, not for the money but for yourself.\n\nI became a composer and went back to doin art, and writing, because those were the things that I did back in high school. Those where the things that I have the most passion about, that don't feel like work, and that make my \\*soul\\* sing with joy.\n\nYet this is only a portion of what's important. The other part is that I am completely aligned, i.e. my thoughts, are completely aligned with my emotions, and my emotions are completely aligned with my actions. There is no distortion. I express and seek truth.\n\nI was able to reach really deep within myself, and actually hear the true sound of \"me\\* without any distortion, that is buried underneath all the layers of bs, and societal and emotional conditioning, that I've accumulated over a lifetime of existing. That's the voice inside you that talks to you, suggests things, and keeps you out of trouble. It's that gut feeling you get.\n\nThat thing inside you is your true self. Believe it or not, you can reach it.\n\nIt has a \\*vibration\\*, a unique signature, that you can tune yourself into, slowly over time. It's the sound of the true you. It's not bs. Everything in the universe is in motion. Nothing is at rest. Everything has a \\*vibration\\* including you, and you can align yourself to it.\n\nThe more you align yourself with yourself the clearer you will know thyself, and knowing thyself is the beginning of the journey toward understanding.\n\nSpeaking of which, this is why \"Know Thyself\" (Greek: \u0393\u03bd\u1ff6\u03b8\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd) was inscribed upon the temple of Apollo at Delphi in Ancient Greece.\n\nThis is also why you get sayings like \"To thy own self be true\".\n\n**The \\*key\\* is alignment, which in turn leads to awakening, and then \\*enlightenment\\*.**\n\nThink about it, when a car is out of alignment it drives like shit. It doesn't matter how expensive or luxury the car is. Same applies to you my friend. If you are out of alignment, no amount of money or financial independence will help you. You will keep feeling miserable or at least \\*lost\\* and \\*without purpose\\* or direction.\n\nSo what I'm saying is that you have to start to understand yourself better, little by little. You got to peel all the layers of bs away, and get to the core of you.\n\nIf you can do that, if you can reach the core and then hear yourself, as you are without any distortion, you will understand who you really are, and what you need to be doing with the rest of your life.\n\nTherapy or a psychologist can help you get part of the way there, but not all the way, as they don't understand the concept of alignment.\n\nThen once you align to yourself, you can then use yourself, kind of like a \\*tuning fork\\*, that resonance, that inner voice, to align yourself to the rest of the universe as a whole. Keep in mind the Universe is like a giant radio station, that is broadcasting on all frequencies, and you are like a little antenna. If you \\*tune\\* yourself like a little radio, into the right frequency and start receiving the right broadcast that is specifically aligned with your inner self, your life will be full of bliss and joy. That alignment is what true \\*faith\\* is. It's basically surrendering to the universe, and allowing it to steer you in the right direction, knowing that it will be \\*fine\\*, it will be \\*ok\\*.\n\nJust think of it like a planetary alignment. Each element of you needs to align in a straight line, so everything is in sync. So you \\*do\\* what is your highest form of expression. You got to be like a little radar dish that focuses in the correct direction to get the big signal.\n\nOne key thing to start the process is to begin to understand that \\*you\\* and what is happening to you are 2 different things. \\*You\\* are not your title, you are not your success, you are  not your accumulated material possessions, nor the labels others identify you as ,or that you identify as.\n\nThose are all just \\*labels\\*, just things that you are doing \\*right now\\*,  but they aren't \\*you\\*.\n\n**So, to summarize, and to kick off the process, recognize that you are not the labels you've attached to yourself, and then turn your attention \\*inward\\* to learn who you really are.**\n\n**TL;DRL Look inward.

I have pretty similar feelings about life as you and almost have same challenges, regardless of the NW difference. I have so far tried 4 therapists. Couple of things I have learned in this journey :\n\n1. Be open during therapy, I was initially hesitant to share really what was bothering me. Later I realized, that was because the therapist were not exactly accepting of how I felt.\n2. Through the week or whenever, start making notes of stuff that would like to talk during therapy. This helps to atleast bucket your issues and address them one by one.\n3. If you can afford it, why not try more than one therapist. I have two right now, one I mostly talk about work, my lack of motivation, goals, etc. The other I mostly talk about personal feelings towards people I care about, how I want my life to look like.. Etc.\n4. Therapist aren't magicians, this is my own personal take - for me therapists are paid actors in my life with whom I can share anything without shame or repurcussions. They are only present in my life for me to bitch about life, all them for feedback about situations, voice my feelings loud. For me I have learnt that voicing my feelings loud is making me self realize what I need to do. I wrote these down and revisit them when I feel like. Ofcourse there might be great therapist who design sessions to tackle problems, but I haven't come across them yet.\n\nFinally regarding going back to work. I have learnt that work gives me a structure that nothing else can. I do not care what perf I am getting at work or what I am working on. I do the bare minimum to be professional, beyond that I just do evening else I would do if I dint have a job. \nHope this helps!"}, {"comment_author": "Plenty-Lion5112", "comment_text": "Going to therapy is like having your car break down in the middle of the woods and all you've got is a phone and a mechanic on the other end.

I think you might be falling for the 'should statements' (returned to work because someone your age \"should\" be working). Trying to figure out where those statements are coming from and even being more aware can help you overcome them. For me it was a childhood of emotional neglect where the only praise or even attention I'd get is by spending my time doing the 'right' things which according to my parents it is doing things that were work or work-like.

Set about strategic planning for your /life/.  An actual plan - vision, mission, values, goals, objectives.  Consider personal, professional, and relationship goals.  Then set about it.  Revisit every 6-12mo.  Values won\u2019t change, but you will need to recalibrate goals and objectives every so often, or remind yourself of them.  Vision and mission may change over time as well, but less frequently.  They set your North Star.  \n\nThis was the greatest gift I was given, and project I undertook, in grad school.

That said I feel you understand that well. So instead I want to focus on why there's nothing wrong with you, at least nothing inherent.\n\nWe are indoctrinated from young to define a good chunk of ourselves through work. Also our society is built around this mindset to an insane level, we'd have to change how we talk, concepts and expressions and throw away centuries of culture to be able to purge it. It's just not going to happen. \n\nThe thing is people who make it to FIRE tend to be very hard workers, and this means you are vulnerable to the narrative. When you leave you find yourself going back, but still being miserable, why? \n\nSo I'd ask you: what is it that you like about working? What does a job give your life? For example for me I found out that work gives me a routine and things to base my life on. I find that if there's no structure in my life, it seems I'm constantly building meaningless things, with structure I can improve my life little by little. That doesn't require a job though, I could volunteer, or take courses, or take some part time job that I enjoy doing, but really do it to have something, or just a hobby. Of course I can't say what would be the best for me, because I haven't tried everything, I'd have to see how it feels and what is missing and what I get and what I like and don't like about each option to be able to speak confidently. That's hard, and I can see why one of the experiments would be \"maybe going back to work with FU money would change the whole thing for the better\", I think that's reasonable and would be true for some people. It just sounds like it isn't for you. \n\nAnd there's a crisis in that situation. You made it! Now what? Now you focus on living your life, experimenting, exploring options. Finding out how to fill it: it's harder now that you don't *need* to fill those 40 hours with work, because now you get to decide what you *want* to fill it with. There's lots of choices: jobs that are very relaxed and enjoyable but not competitive, part time jobs, consulting based on how bored you are, working for a non profit that feels more meaningful, or just a hobby that you enjoy and work on X hours a day.\n\nPoint is, it is normal to not know what to do, but discovering what that is can be its own fun. It's ok to make mistakes, to try things that you end up regretting, that's part of the process!  And it's normal that once you get to FIRE level it takes a bit to start to really take advantage of it and enjoy yourself.\n\nAnd then, after that, assess, what are the things about work that make you miserable? What are the things about work that keep pulling you back.

And, while you\u2019re at it, why not make your car purchase now too, so you can enjoy your commute more for awhile?"}, {"comment_author": "pf_youdontknowme", "comment_text": "Dude, you are 55 and have a 4-year-old? How old is your wife? You didn't put Social Security benefits into your calculations as future income, but you should include that in any projections because it's not far off. I also don't see anything about healthcare costs unless you are assuming you'd have coverage in a part-time role or through your wife's projected job.\n\nNothing wrong with wanting to leave an inheritance to your child. But it's much more important that you ensure that your (and your wife's) retirement needs are fully met. And not only don't you know how long you will live, you also don't know how long your wife will live. It's likely she'll be around long after you, and will also need financial security.\n\nGo back to using Monarch for at least six months before you make a decision. And during that time, make sure you are using receipts from general spending places like the ones you mentioned - Costco, Target, Amazon. Get a real handle on how much your fixed expenses are, how much your necessary but flexible expenses are and how much your optional expenses are.\n\nThen plug your numbers into calculators like [this](https://www.firecalc.com/) and [this](https://cfiresim.com/). Be sure to include your SS benefit at whatever age you plan to start taking that.\n\nYou can play around with withdrawal numbers to see what your failure rate looks like, based on varying liquid asset levels. And remember that you can always adjust your spending down if trouble looms. For instance, you can pull your child from private school and cut back on unnecessary spending.\n\nSpeaking of which, $40K is absolutely a waste of money unless your child has serious needs that cannot be managed in public school, or unless you live a bad school district. \"COVID\" and lack of socialization is not a good reason to hold back from kindergarten. Surely your wife has been socializing your child over the last few years? Kindergarten is about learning how to function away from parents in a semi-structured environment, working on sharing and communication skills, learning to follow rules, etc. Save your money for private school later when the education part really comes into play, like middle or high school. Even then, it may not be worth the cost."}, {"comment_author": "OrganicFrost", "comment_text": "I would assume private school will be significantly more expensive than just the tuition and not retire until you're more certain of those expenses.  If you're set on your kid being in private school all the way through college, I'd do some serious research into expected cost there, because it doesn't look like you're set up for that at all.\n\nI have a few other concerns as well, but it's possible you've addressed them already:\n\n1. Is your wife good with you retiring and her working for 10 more years?  This is one of those things that really requires both partners to be enthusiastically on board.  I love my partner a lot, but I would not be cool with her retiring 10 years before me, unless our circumstances changed somehow.  That being said, my opinion doesn't matter at all here, only yours and hers do.  I would want your financial situation to be able to withstand her changing her mind here, ideally, though.\n2. A lot of people in higher income brackets don't budget precisely, and I don't even think you need to account for every dollar before FIRE-ing, but I think no one who retires should be surprised at all by their spending.  It sounds like you're a bit surprised by how high your spending is, based on some comments, and that is a red flag to me.  You don't need to know that you spend exactly $42.55/week on lattes, but you should be able to look at monthly and annual spend and say \"yeah, that sounds about right\" and have the skillset to dig in and figure it out if anything looks off or surprising.\n3. Based on what you've posted of your salary and your wife's salary, and the low 401k balance, I suspect you've inherited a good amount of this money.  To be clear, there's no shame in that, but it makes me extra concerned that you don't seem super clear on your own spending.\n4. The 4% rule is a great starting point.  It was originally developed based on a 30 year retirement, and I'm guessing you aim for a longer retirement than that.  Broadly speaking, I like the advice The Money Guy Show gives on reducing that by 0.5% for each 10 years before 65 you're aiming to retire.  So if you're 55, I'd aim for 3.5%.  If you're 45, 3%.  If you're 35, 2.5%.  If you're 25, 2%.  If you have coherent, data driven arguments and detailed simulations for using other SWRs, by all means, these aren't perfect.  But I think they're a good guideline.\n\nIf you retire early, you're essentially taking a job as CFO of your portfolio.  It's totally normal for folks to consult with financial advisors, and I think it's a good idea to run any early retirement plans past advisors before executing.  Some people do FIRE with a financial advisor, and that's okay too, so long as their fees have been worked into the SWR.  But even if you are working with a financial advisor, you should feel like you know almost as much as they do when talking about your portfolio.\n\nIf you haven't already, I would take a look at Ramit Sethi's content, and The Money Guy Show's content, both on youtube.  I would also read \"The Simple Path to Wealth,\" by JL Collins.\n\nGood luck!"}, {"comment_author": "Gloomy-Direction7683", "comment_text": " You're about as FIRE as a water-soaked campfire on a rainy day!"}, {"comment_author": "Fi-Me-Away", "comment_text": "Going to be as honest as I can. \n\nSo here are my concerns and thoughts. \n\n1. With your burn rate, rather than talk about where the money goes, you have the same shock as it's for your accountants. Nothing against using the professionals, but you should understand more about your expenses. \n\n2. If you are using professionals to manage your money, your returns will likely be less. You are also less likely to do bad things with your money. It's a trade off based on your behavior, knowledge and comfort. The 4% rule may not work for you. \n\n3. You are adamant about leaving a legacy. You need to be more conservative. If I die with nothing or in debt, it's ok. I don't plan to leave a legacy. The 4% rule likely is a bad choice.\n\n4. Don't value the cost of the art/antiques with the 4% rule. Use a professional's opinion on this or sell before counting the value.\n\n5. For the life style you are talking about, 4.4 mil sounds low. I wonder if the burn rate is pure spending or does it include taxes. What number did the advisor suggest?\n\n6.  My most important recommendation, switch to r/fatFIRE. Your lifestyle is upper class. This sub is upper middle class. There is a wealth of difference between the two. You will find more people there that will focus on your questions and numbers. And fewer judging you for setting your children up for the same upper class lifestyle. \n\nTldr go to r/fatFIRE as we won't be able to fully evaluate your financial planner or your goals.

If you're ok with that range and risk then retire.Also, your kid could be middle aged by the time you both die (not knowing your age or health), so if they aren't also supporting themselves by then that's a big line item in your budget you're missing.

My guess is your financial planner has seen your tendency to spend most of all of what you have, hence the recommendation...BUT other BIG consideration is the structure of the arrangement you have with the financial planner.

Your normal 1099 has the amount you paid for the stock (which is discounted), and the amount you sold it for. If you use these values, you will be double paying taxes. There should also be a document which contains an adjusted cost basis for each transaction - you will enter these adjusted cost basis numbers into your taxes. The adjusted cost basis is the fair market value for the stock you purchased.\n\nIf you don't enter the adjusted cost basis, then the 15% discount will be taxed both as ordinary income (already done; reported on your W2) and then taxed again as capital gains.\n\nYour RSUs generally shouldn't be too confusing.

We don't get it ratcheted up the longer we've been in the district. It's just a flat 10 per year. I think the reason there's no cap on the accrual is so that if an employee has a critical health event (i.e. having children or a severe illness, they can spend down their days without having a severe, immediate impact on their livelihood). I know there tends to be a \"pink tax\" of sorts in the profession. A lot of my female colleagues have spent down their banks due to childbirth or having to take care of sick children.

Didn\u2019t get a chance to drive either as the dealerships we visited couldn't keep them in stock. Ended up test driving a 2023 Toyota Venza, a 2021 Toyota Rav4 Hybrid, a 2023 Mazda CX-5 and a 2022 Subaru Forester Wilderness edition. Ended up with the Subaru. Wasn't the most fuel efficient car, but we won't have to just rely on my wife's Rav4 to get us up to Tahoe and it's a comfortable ride. Best of all, my insurance actually went down from the Focus I was driving.\n\nThere wasn't a whole lot of wiggle room in the negotiating process, though we did spend about two hours getting the price knocked down from $29.9 to $29.2. Our out the door price was $32k, with taxes and fees, and I threw on an extended warranty since it was previously a lease. Went on something of a buying frenzy and after today will have spent about $3.2 more on the car. So all in all, with all of the goodies and protection, it came out to be about the same price as a new Subaru Forester Wilderness with out all the bells and whistles.\n\nDid I get the best deal?

I\u2019m going to receive a significant severance payment in May, and sell a vacation home at the same time, resulting in around $1 million dollars in cash becoming available to invest in the next few months. \r  \n\r  \nAs additional context, my chosen career path will have significantly fewer job opportunities available going forward, compared to the job market I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to experience over the past decade. I\u2019m considering taking time off from the workforce to spend more time with my family.  I would value some perspective on the best way to approach portfolio allocation, how to invest $1M in cash, and the age-old question \u201cdo I have enough saved to retire\u201d?\r  \n\r  \nPersonal situation:\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019m mid-30\u2019s, male, in very good physical health (knock on wood), and divorced with 5 year old in public school.  I\u2019m currently unpartnered, but would like to have additional children in the future if a future partner also felt strongly about having more children.  My parents live a couple hours away and are in their late 60\u2019s/early 70\u2019s.  I\u2019ll likely need to help care for them over the next couple of decades.  I don\u2019t particularly enjoy eating out, traveling, shopping etc, and have often thought that early retirement would be a good fit for my preferred lifestyle (working out outdoors, DIY, general frugality).  \r  \n\r  \nCurrent Assets:\r  \n\r  \nI will have around $2M in assets available, with my primary residence NOT included in the $2M assets.\r  \n\r  \n\\-$500k cash (including severance in May, not including sale of vacation house).\r  \n\\-$450k 401k VFFVX (Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Fund with a 60/40 US/ROW split)\r  \n\\-$130k Roth IRA, about 70% VTI and 30% VXUS\r  \n\\-$375k Brokerage, about 60% VTI and 40% VXUS\r  \n\\-$20k BTC\r  \n\\-$10k HSA\r  \n\\-Primary residence fully paid off, estimated value of $575k, and a $355k HELOC available if needed for emergency investments (balance currently zero).\r  \n\\-Vacation home fully paid off, estimated value of $515k.  I plan to list this property for sale in late April, and hopefully close a sale by July.\r  \n\\-Car fully paid off, estimated value $15k.  This is largely outside the scope of this conversation, but I\u2019ll likely try to find the most frugal car to purchase as part of a trade-in later this year.\r  \n\\-Credit cards fully paid off every month.\r  \n\r  \nCurrent Expenses:\r  \n\r  \nMy total base living expenses have been around $20k/yr for the past several years.  This includes condo fees, utilities, and real estate taxes on my primary residence, food, car insurance, fuel, clothes, repairs etc.  \r  \n\r  \nThe two primary unknowns with my expenses are health insurance/care and child support. I think a realistic estimate for both of those expenses ($10k and $20k respectively) would bring my total closer to $50k/yr.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nSignificant Upcoming Unknown Expenses:\r  \n\r  \nOne of the biggest long term unknowns relates to my current primary residence.  It\u2019s possible that a future partner would like a better or larger primary residence, since my current primary residence is a garden level condo without a lot of natural light, with 2 bedrooms, 2 living rooms, 1 bathroom.  One of the living rooms could be converted to a third bedroom but it would be a tight squeeze and it doesn\u2019t currently have a wall or a door.  It would be possible to put in a second bathroom, but it would also be a very tight squeeze.  In short, the condo I\u2019m in now is extremely cost effective with me and my son, but any substantial family growth would likely require a new residence.\r  \n\r  \nChild support is a bit unknown.  I anticipate shared custody with my ex around 50/50 for the foreseeable future, but have historically earned more than my ex.  Even after I lose my job, by my calculations I will likely still have to pay around $400/week for a significant amount of time, possibly years depending on the family court.  I\u2019m not looking for legal advice on this thread, as my attorney has said this is a very murky area in my state.  I\u2019m essentially trying to plan for the highest expense scenario with the $50k number above.\r  \n\r  \nFuture costs for my child\u2019s life experiences are unknown.  Even though I may not want to travel or eat out a lot, and hope to find a future partner who matches my lifestyle, my child might end up enjoying life experiences that cost more money, and I\u2019d like to be able to experience those together.\r  \n\r  \nIt\u2019s possible that I would need to purchase my siblings share of my parents house when they pass away.  If this occurred in an emergency situation, I could pull from my HELOC in a pinch without needing to sell stock.\r  \n\r  \nQuestions:\r  \n\r  \nI currently have around 40 times my yearly living expenses in various accounts including retirement.  On the surface I think this is clearly enough to strongly consider early retirement, but wanted to make sure I haven\u2019t forgotten anything above that would make early retirement less viable?\r  \n\r  \nAs an example, a significant amount of my assets are in pre-tax retirement accounts (ie I will have to pay tax on the assets upon withdrawal).  I\u2019m not sure how components like this should be considered as part of the 4% rule?  I\u2019d assume that any pre-tax accounts should be discounted by an assumed future tax rate.\r  \n\r  \nAsset allocation is currently heavily equities, which I think makes sense given my investment horizon.  The approximate 60/40 split between US/ROW also seems to make sense based on what I\u2019ve read about long term diversity.  That said, all suggestions are very welcome on the best way to think about things like VXUS in tax advantaged vs regular brokerage accounts, along with overall asset allocation.  \r  \n\r  \nPlanning for conversions from my 401k to IRAs is another area I\u2019m uncertain about.  I\u2019m assuming it would make sense to convert because I\u2019d gain investment flexibility, but the disadvantage seems to be a longer timeline to begin withdrawals (55 vs 59.5).  I\u2019m also uncertain if I should roll over to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA, as it seems like taking income in the years I am in a lower tax bracket could make sense?\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019d value any perspective on best practices for health care given the facts listed above.  My child is currently on my ex\u2019s health insurance and would likely stay on her health insurance indefinitely.  I live in Massachusetts, and would likely go through the MA health connector.  I think $10k/yr seems reasonable based on what I\u2019ve estimated, but am interested in other thoughts.\r  \n\r  \nAnd finally, if you\u2019ve made it this far, the question in the title of my post!  I will have around $1M in cash after receiving severance and sale of the vacation home.  Given that equities are currently valued aggressively relative to historical trends, I\u2019m planning to dollar cost average around $100k per month into 60/40 VTI/VXUS over the remainder of the year, and potentially tax loss harvest at the end of year.  I\u2019d value any perspective on this plan, such as if it makes sense to dollar cost average over a long time period?\r  \n", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "brisketandbeans", "comment_text": "I think your plan is fine.

You should aim to keep it invested and growing though, at least as aggressively as the rest of your holdings. Other than too much in ex-US (10% tops is what I'd say), no arguments with how you have that invested from me, except maybe bump the lifestyle fund out to 2065 or 2070 (assuming that's in an IRA and no capital gains will be taxed).\n\nThat's enough cash on the taxed side of the fence to consider investments that pay dividends that you can live off of.

We're also expecting our first kid in a couple months.\n\nInitially our plan was for my wife to quit her job when the baby comes and then i'd keep working until we actually hit the FIRE #, at which point i'd quit too. But the closer we get the more guilty I feel. I could work longer and help pay for my kids college, be able to better help my parents with expenses as they age, treat my kids/nephews/nieces to better gifts, etc.  There's a lot I could do to increase my family's well being.\n\nHere's my details and thought process:\n\n* Me and wife both 34. One kid on the way, planning to have a second eventually.\n* I currently make \\~200k and wife makes \\~350k. Both WFH. Wife hates job, I'm indifferent.\n* House paid off\n* Average monthly spend is 6k\n* Current FIRE target is 4MM and 3% withdrawal rate, aka 10k a month. Bit of a buffer because we're pretty young,  I don't know how expensive 2 kids or insurance will be.\n\n\n\nSo this is what i'm wrestling with. The positives of RE now is that obviously get to stop working and spend that time doing things I enjoy. Obvious, but I don't want to understate how nice that is. I also get to be 100% involved with my kids as they grow up. I can also be around to help my aging parents with anything they need in person.\n\nOn the flipside, I WFH, so I can already be pretty involved with my kids even while working, and my wife will be 100% around so they'll be well taken care of. I'd be able to increase our networth/annual spend so I can make sure I can provide whatever my kids need (college expenses, any hobbies/sports they want etc) beyond what we'd be able to do now. It would also keep us safe for any future changes to ACA or taxes. It also lets me help my aging parents on the financial side.\n\nWhen I try to list out the pros/cons it always seems that working more is the right answer, but at the same time that will *always* be the case. I'll never actually FIRE if I keep thinking like that. At some point I have to decide that FIREing is the right choice but I don't know how to figure out when that is.\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry if this is a bit of rambling.

The SAH parent will lose their full damn mind if they don't get a break, and you'll want date nights etc.\n\nMy partner quit her job and stayed at home and she had tremendous difficulty, to the point where I feared she was depressed. So we hired a part-time nanny and that improved her mental state signficantly. Our full childcare cost for preschool at the moment is something like $1200/month for a part time preschool in a VHCOL area. We have to pay extra for all of the times the school is on break/holiday, camps cost something like $400/week. And now my toddler is at the age where she's very involved in arts and activities, wants a lot of toys, has a lot more needs that require purchasing things despite our frugality and willingness to accept free/secondhand items.\n\nSo unless you're depressed at work and hate it, I'd suss it out and see how you're looking financially and mentally in one year's time.

I think a kid growing up seeing some work/life balancing is a healthy environment(even though in 40 years people might not need to work much at all!)."}, {"comment_author": "ShrugBlurp", "comment_text": "We were in a similar situation. I didn't love my job so became a SAHM. Once we hit our FIRE target we reassessed.\n\nThings we found were\n\n1) Initially I surprisingly struggled with no longer working. I think so much of our identity is enmeshed with our job - think about when you meet new people socially, quite often they will ask where you work or what you do. And its a sad fact of life that strangers will react differently on hearing youre an accountant/engineer/pilot/whatever to hearing you're *just* a stay at home parent. So there's the psychological aspect. \n\nAlso, whilst you may have quit the grind, most of your friends won't be free for brunch, daytime gym meetups - they still all work. So it needs time and effort devoted to making new friends (not always easy as an adult) but fortunately kids are a great way of meeting new people, at baby groups, play parks, sports clubs, etc.\n\n2) my husband actually likes his job. Being FI means that over the last 10 years he's been able to not go for promotions that would impact our family life. Instead of climbing the career ladder (meaning longer hours, more stress, more travel) has gone for sideways job moves. And hes now in a role which he pretty much invented for himself - its something he enjoys intellectually, he's got to pick his own team of coworkers, he does a basic 8-5 and doesn't feel pressure to keep on top of his work emails at the weekend or in the evenings so it doesn't encroach on family time (and to be fair the pay is good).\n\nHe always planned to FIRE in his early 50s, however now hes reached that age and we have 2 young teens so what he's now thinking of doing is working till they finish school and go off to university. His work gives him a lot of positives - pretty much to the extent where the money earned is nearly an irrelevant factor. \n\n3) There is a massive mental load that comes with kids. Initially when i became a SAHM I took it all on myself. Doctors appointments, play dates, food shop, buying clothes, housework, hiding vegetables in their dinner, academic targets, keeping a gremlin with a 3 minute attention span entertained all day, a constant drip drip drip of cognitive and emotional tasks. I love that you say you want to be 100% involved with your kids as they grow, so I've mentioned this mental load so you can go into parenting with your eyes open and hopefully won't default to letting your wife carry the whole burden - its so easy for one parent to become the default who is on 24/7 especially when the other parent is working. \n\nYou and your wife have the money to pay for a cleaner, to outsource the bits of boring everyday life, to generally make both your lives easier. Don't be afraid to spend that money (lots of FIRE people get into a mindset of saving as much as possible always).When i had a toddler and a newborn we got an au pair, because i found that whilst i could do everything i was exhausted and not enjoying it, and just having someone to watch the kids whilst i had a shower, or tried to cook dinner, or to entertain the toddler whist i napped with the baby for an hour absolutely saved my sanity and massively reduced the stress of keeping all the plates spinning. \n\nBasically what we've found is that being FI means my husband has the freedom to say no to doing things at work that would negativity impact family life. For us as a family unit my husband still working means we'll have a fatter FIRE and the kids will have more of a financial leg up when they are young adults. When most couples argue it tends to boil down to a few things - chores, money, stress, and having FI means that you're in a position where tyese things don't need to be a negative factor in your relationship."}, {"comment_author": "Funny_Enthusiasm6976", "comment_text": "I think you should definitely fund the kids\u2019 college fund.
