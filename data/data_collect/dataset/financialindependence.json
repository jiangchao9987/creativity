This promotion shouldn\u2019t affect my work life balance too much, but the next tier seems to experience a fair bit of burnout, which has me thinking I need to figure out what I want next.\n\nIf I could give some unsolicited advice to someone in a non-profit looking to make more, it would be to take on the big scary projects, push hard while cutting your teeth, learn the boring stuff no one likes to do, and don\u2019t be afraid to shift fields. There are many ways to non-profit, and non-profit doesn\u2019t necessarily mean low pay. Also, learn a language! Every role I\u2019ve ever had (apart from being an ESOL teacher) is because I speak French and/or Chinese. This country (US) doesn\u2019t seem to value it, so set yourself apart and learn it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**-Spouse (31 y/o) - French Teacher - $59,163**\n\nNot much of an update here. SO still loves their work despite the long commute (30 minutes each way). She had an opportunity to move to a closer district last year that fell through, but ultimately helped her realize how much she values the culture of her building. Though it\u2019s a longer commute, the salary schedule actually is quite rewarding after you have some time in district and she\u2019ll be close to 100k within 10 years assuming no changes (positive or negative) to her education and/or salary schedule. That said, this Spring Break she powered through a course that will move her over on the schedule. So we may just hit that number a year or so sooner.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-**Family**\n\nReading last year\u2019s post and seeing how fast we\u2019ve come\u2026 just wow. I\u2019m very happy to report that our oldest son is fully conversant and on par with his classmates now. SO had a scary doctor\u2019s visit late last year that basically told us we needed to make some lifestyle changes, cutting carbs, sugars, upping protein, and exercising. The annual follow up is coming soon, but I\u2019m proud to say the household has lost at least 75 lbs in fat to date and we\u2019re both feeling better. SO loves working with a trainer and we have an at home gym that I use between meetings. Everyone is happy and seemingly healthy.\n\nFinancially though,I will say that daycare costs began for us in August and it is incredible how much it costs for two kids in an average daycare center in the midwest. Costs increase later this week, bringing us to just shy of $28,500 annualized daycare costs. And let me just say, this has been an adjustment. Our cash reserves have taken a beating as we stubbornly struggle(d?) to adjust our spending to accommodate for the high costs. I just learned of my promotion a few weeks ago, so we\u2019re hopeful the increased income helps us right the ship. We haven\u2019t begun taking advantage of Dependent Care FSAs yet but will likely begin to do so in the upcoming enrollment cycle. Needless to say, it\u2019s going to feel like a huge payraise when our daycare costs suddenly end in a few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Numbers**\n\nNet Worth - $283,574\n\nInvestments - $167,286.58\n\n* This number is inclusive of SO\u2019s pension balance. As mentioned last year, we\u2019re planning to use her retirement accounts to fund purchasing years. I\u2019ve got the paperwork on my desk and the plan is to purchase our first in the coming months.Aiming for a full pension in 16-18 years.\n\nHome Equity - $108,082.19\n\nCash - $12,395.49\n\n\u201cDebt\u201d - ($4,189.87)\n\n* (*In quotations, as this is a snapshot of balances on the day I record. In this particular instance I was just returning from a business trip where I\u2019m waiting for a \\~$2,700 reimbursement to be approved)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts/Reflections**\n\nThis year wasn\u2019t as big of a Net Worth bump as I\u2019d hoped, and most of that can be blamed on lifestyle inflation and childcare costs. As well as perhaps a bit of actual inflation. The reduction in cash was stopped within a few months of daycare starting and we have plans to build that back up, but it\u2019s going to take some time. Daycare is just shy of my SO\u2019s actual takehome pay after required pension contributions.\n\nOther than that\u2026 Honestly, I\u2019m just starting to feel\u2026old? 2023 through early 2024 wasn\u2019t easy with SO\u2019s health news, but I also lost a grandparent, had two parents go through a rough divorce (one losing their mom, my grandma, and the other being laid off shortly after). I also had to watch my dad go through six weeks of radiation for cancer. We\u2019re waiting to see what the long-term prognosis of that is. I\u2019m just starting to notice the cracks in my parents. They\u2019re getting old, not as sharp as they used to be, not as strong, and they\u2019re self sabotaging (we all are). Having all this happen, while my kids grow up and become more independent\u2026 I\u2019m just starting to see how ephemeral life really is. We\u2019re just another chapter before the next, living the same struggles personified in our unique voices. I\u2019ve said it for years about my fields of work, but if society says we have to work, then we may as well do something that helps humanity along the way. This has been ringing a lot more true over the last year.", "\\> the household has lost at least 75 lbs in fat\n\nIf it helps, I found them! Happy to return at any time...", "No need to return it.

You will simply be billed at full price by the insurer until you cancel it yourself or they terminate you for non-payment.\n\nYou could generate enough income this month to get deemed ineligible for Medicaid as long as that fits in with your other financial planning.

The \u201ccombined income\u201d goes up by a dollar which causes $0.50 of the social security benefits to be taxed at the marginal tax bracket.

For an extra $1-200k though, then you get into 'perfect' territory.

Does it make sense to pull out $150-200k for a much more significant downpayment to be able to afford a slightly better home?  I've done some compound interest calculations and if we decreased our monthly contributions by 50% AND cut our retirement accounts from $690k to $500k (taking out $190 for a down payment)....it would only increase the time to $3.75 by about 3 ish years, which seems worth it to me.

I am fortunate enough to be entitled to receive a COLA-adjusted pension upon retirement but will still need to withdraw from our retirement accounts to meet our expected expenses.  .

Is it better to start the Roth conversion ladder upon retirement (can I even do this at age 50), or should I just withdraw from my 457 because it is penalty free (although I have to pay taxes)?  \n2.  Should I withdraw from the taxable account first to meet withdrawal needs or just tap into the 457 and let the taxable account grow?  \n3.  After step 4, since my plan is to withdraw from my wife's Roth IRA, should I also start doing a Roth conversion ladder from my 457, or leave that alone?  \n\n\nThis is all so complicated to me so I would greatly appreciate any insight and guidance from this community. Changing from an accumulation mindset to one of spending and reaping the rewards will definitely be a challenge, but my wife and I have plans on how to enjoy the rest of our lives.  ", "It *is* complicated, and doing something long term optimal requires knowing a lot about your future withdrawals during later years when you are drawing social security and taking RMDs.  But one of the key pieces of information is how much you'll have in those RMDs which is a probability distribution dependent on your current strategy (and the probabilites represent future returns). \n\nRealistically it's going to be very difficult to optimize the last few dollars, but here are some general heuristics to consider: \n\nIf you're going to be on ACA plans and potentially eligible for a subsidy, that adds a LOT to the effective tax rate on income generated between now and 65.\n\nThere are two cliffs to be concerned with now (150% and 200% FPL) and another at 400% FPL in 2026 and forward if the subsidy calculation change expires (very likely if government is divided next term).   Cliff means if you can get under it, it's very valuable to do so, and you should do your best to do it.  If you won't be able to get under a certain cliff every year but could get close, it might be worth doing a really big Roth conversion in your first year in order to ensure the ability to do it from 5 years ahead through age 65 (need to model this).   The cliffs at 150% and 200% give extra savings on copays, deductible and MOOP,  and are very important if you have big health needs (expensive drugs, lot of appointments, higher likelihood of ER or hospital needs).  They are less important (but still worth something as insurance) if you are very healthy and likely to need minimal medical care (as long as you stay that way).   The cliff at 400% will mean a really big additional premium bill for earning 1 extra dollar.   For me and my wife in our late 50s, this would be something like an 8k/year difference in premium if it comes back and we can't get under it vs. getting under it by $1.  Exact amount depends on what's available in your market, basically you from paying a percent of income to full price.   \n\nIn between 200% and 400%, as you go up the scale, you have an effective tax rate on extra MAGI that starts at around 10% (for the first 1000 over the 200% FPL), and goes up to almost 20% in spots with an average of 15% for the entire range.   Then you are currently at 8.5% for over 400% FPL but that could become a cliff in 2026 where you lose all subsidy at exactly 400% FPL (or maybe it's $1 over). \n\nBasically, this extra effective tax rate, pretty much overwhelms the differences in long term tax planning for various withdrawal strategies and means that you should try to keep your income as low as you can for the years from retirement until age 65.   \n\nNote: it *might* not overwhelm it in the best cases where your investments go full bull between now and age 75 and you end up at the top your potential wealth, but it definitely will overwhelm it in all the cases where you're at all concerned about portfolio survival at that point.   This also means that if you're doing something like a 1-2% withdrawal rate with an eye toward leaving a very large legacy, things might need more calculation here.  But if you are taking a 3-4% WR or more and the possibility of running out of money is a significant factor in your planning and how you chose your WR, this will be the case.\n\nSo that means that you want to look at your spending level and see what's feasible.   How much do you spend -- how much do you have in taxable?   Roughly what % of basis does it have?  Do you have any existing Roth contributions or 5 year old conversion basis that could be taken?\n\nSuppose you do no Roth conversions and take your spending exactly proportionally from taxable, 457 and Roth contributions in a way that is likely to be sustainable until 59.5 (and 65 if you include 403b and traditional IRA money).  How much AGI does that result in you having each year (remembering that basis in taxable accounts, and Roth withdrawals do not count as income)?   If it's close to one of the 150% or 200% cliffs, maybe adjust to take more basis/taxable or Roth contributions if possible.  If not possible to do every year, maybe do it every other year, or do some churning in your taxable account or a big Roth conversion to enable doing it most/every year going forward.\n\nif you're close to but over the 400% cliff, you need to *definitely* do something to create more basis or do Roth conversions that will allow you to stay under it for most years going forward and you want to do it this year or next while you can still get *some* subsidy if your income will still be less than 1/.085 x your full premium cost.  \n\nin between, just realize that reducing income *now*, as long as doing so won't use up Roth or basis in a way that prevents you staying under a cliff later is worth a lot, probably around 15% plus whatever the tax rate is.\n\nonce you hit 65, you have a different threshold to worry about, which is IRMAA for medicare, but this doesn't touch you below 206k income if you are married, so if you aren't close to the fat range, it will be a problem for when you are widowed or potentially divorced, and maybe not even then.\n\nBut it will likely make sense at 65 to start making big roth conversions until you draw social security (and possibly up until RMD age) in order to reduce your RMDs.   Depending on how this interacts with the IRMAA table, it may make sense to convert everything at once, or to do big chunks over several years that keep you just under various IRMAA thresholds.   \n\nBut as long as you are getting ACA insurance, that's a model for 10-15 years from now.  For now, do what you can to stay under the relevant cliffs and otherwise reduce current MAGI, and that will probably be very close to optimal if not totally.", "You can use [my sheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/19bln0e/fire_withdrawal_strategy_tax_and_magi_google_sheet/) to model a number of scenarios to see the impact on taxes and MAGI.

Obviously I want the market to go up. But with the REG, when it's at an ATH I kind of wish it would be flat for a while so I could increase equities before it went up even more. Emotionally, this means I'm happy when it's not at an ATH, **and** happy when it goes up (which it must have if it *is* at an ATH). Being happy all the time is kind of the point of early retirement, so I'd say this works very well for me.\n\nNow, there are a bunch of other reasons why money/market stuff doesn't bring me down, not least of which is that my wife and I are both working part-time on school days just for fun, so that income means all the detailed number-crunching we did pre-retirement was WAY too conservative.\n\nI certainly wouldn't blame someone for doing a static allocation, but unless you use a robo or your allocation is 100%, you have to log in occasionally to rebalance.

If market returns are such that you can't survive after the first few years, you didn't have enough money to retire, and no method would have worked for you. If you use cFIRESim to look at 1966 with 4% withdrawal, it doesn't fail right away. It takes 20 years. Nothing rational will fail \"after a few years\".\n\nSequence of returns risk means that if you get a 5% average annual return over 20 years, certain sequences could still cause you to run out of money. If the bad years are first, you might run out, while if the bad years were at the end, you are fine. The order matters.\n\nIn VPW (or any other similar method), if you get a 5% average return over 20 years, it makes no difference what order it came in. The bad returns can come in the first five years or the last five years, you are in the same place. \n\nVPW is not subject to sequence risk, but any drawdown method is subject to total return risk. You still have to save enough money. If this seems counterintuitive I'd just suggest reading more about VPW on Bogleheads, which is where most of the expert information is (as the developer of the method posts there).", "You are confusing total return with sequence of returns.\n\nJust to save the inevitable reply, start here: [https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2900256#p2900256](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2900256#p2900256) \n\nThere's more you can read on it if you want.", "Well I sort of feel like I'm being gaslit here, which isn't an issue for me because I know the facts, but could be for OP who came here to ask a legitimate question.", "I am actually doing VPW, and I'm not a FatFIRE guy (BUT, I don't have 4 kids, and I think that's a pretty relevant consideration). For me it's been emotionally easy, because we had one bad year and then the following year was great. I also used VPW to set my budget the last few years before retirement, but those were all good years and it was a voluntary restriction I could have removed at any time.\n\nThe big question when you're considering VPW is how low can things go, and what would that do to you. longinvest puts a \"required flexibility\" cell into his spreadsheet (I think he has renamed it a couple of times) which shows what your number would look like after a 50% equity drop, since that is something you should anticipate will happen eventually in your retirement.\n\nI didn't calculate my equivalent number exactly the same way, but I had one. I used a backtesting spreadsheet to see, for different starting years, what the historical chances had been of dropping below that number if starting from what I had at that point. Basically like you would do a failure rate simulation with SWR, but for me failure was having less than $X a year to withdraw (and it wouldn't have been literal failure, it would have been \"everything is paid for, but there is very little for fun stuff\"... actual failure where I can't pay bills or whatnot was another 10K below $X for me).\n\nOne thing people might not realize until they do backtesting is that in those rough cases like 70s stagflation / lost decade etc, it's not just a single year of lower withdrawals. It's generally a number of years. SWR might have run out of money, but the VPW retiree is living lean. Whatever your \"number I could live on\" is going to be, you have to be OK with the possibility it could end up being FOR LIFE. You can't retire the day your spreadsheet gives you a number you like. However you calculate your buffer, you need one. \\[And this is where people here apparently get mad at me -- this is market return risk, not sequence of return risk.\\]\n\nThis then leaves two questions which only you can decide based on your life and risk tolerance... what is $X for you, and what probability of \"failure\" (having to live at $X, adjusted for inflation, for the rest of your life) are you willing to accept? For me, my VPW number at the end of 2021 was 40% higher than my $X, and was about double the \"actual\" failure rate. Basically if we have another Great Depression and equities drop 80-90%, I better hope they come back before I spend through my fixed income (assuming that hasn't all defaulted). But everyone else will be hurting in that case too.\n\nVPW isn't a silver bullet and it isn't for everyone. It formalizes how most humans actually behave though; if things go well, it says you can spend a little more, and if things go poorly, it says you have to tighten your belt. People doing SWR with Guyton Klinger guardrails or equivalent are doing a similar thing. One thing newbies get wrong is they don't like the 3.5% or whatever of SWR and they see VPW and say \"oh great, this one lets me spend more.\" If losing 10-15% of your current income level would cause great discomfort for your family, you are not ready to retire using VPW. VPW will let you retire with less than SWR, because SWR is generally inefficient, but even looking at the old VPW tables, that would have been 4.3-4.9% for someone under 60 and using a 70-30 portfolio, which isn't that far off the 4.5% that Bengen has endorsed.", "Sequence of return risk is a risk for any stock based retirement plan.", "Wow, thank you so much!\n\nNot to get too meta, but it bugs me a little that you're getting downvoted.

It makes a lot of sense.\n\n> I don't have 4 kids, and I think that's a pretty relevant consideration\n\nYeah, that's a good point. My \"fixed costs\" are probably higher and a higher percentage of total costs compared to childless retirees (not just FatFIRE retirees).\n\n> for me failure was having less than $X a year to withdraw (and it wouldn't have been literal failure, it would have been \"everything is paid for, but there is very little for fun stuff\"... actual failure where I can't pay bills or whatnot was another 10K below $X for me).\n\nI think this is actually a pretty fair point that mostly gets ignored because it's personal and hard to model generically, not because it's irrelevant. To misquote [Chesterton](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/13211-the-christian-ideal-has-not-been-tried-and-found-wanting)--it has not been tried and found wanting, it has been found difficult and left untried. But I wonder if most people (perhaps subconsciously) model their spending in two categories of \"must-have\" and \"nice-to-have\", or maybe a sliding scale of nice to have. If there was an easy to to do SWR for the first category and VPW for the second, I wonder how that changes both the success rate and the emotional ease of sticking to the plan.\n\n>But everyone else will be hurting in that case too.\n\nThis is something I tell my skeptical brothers all the time. My plan for early retirement only fails if the economy collapses in an unprecedented way, and who can possibly predict what that scenario really looks like?\n\n> People doing SWR with Guyton Klinger guardrails \n\nI specifically wondered about the differences compared to guardrails, so thanks for confirming it's fundamentally a similar idea.\n\n> VPW will let you retire with less than SWR, because SWR is generally inefficient, \n\nI think I know what you mean by inefficient, but I'm not sure. There are some large expenses where I have some flexibility on timing (for example, I have solar panels on my roof, and I could have waited a year to install them had I wanted to; my family will at some point go on a European vacation; etc). It costs me fewer shares if I do it when the market is up instead of when the market is down, and preserving shares is essential for the long-term success of my plan. VPW naturally allows for more spending when spending (in dollars) is cheap (in shares), whereas SWR ignores that aspect.\n\nIs that roughly what you mean by efficiency, or is there more to it that I'm missing?\n\nAnyway, thanks again for typing all that out. One final question if you are still reading--is there a table similar to ERN's that tells you what % to use for VPW based on your AA, so that in the long run your \"income\" goes up not down? I suppose it's as simple as the long-term returns of whatever AA you're considering, and you just have to stomach tradeoff between returns/risk?", "\"If there was an easy to to do SWR for the first category and VPW for the second, I wonder how that changes both the success rate and the emotional ease of sticking to the plan.\"\n\nI think you could do that if you used an annuity to fund your first category and then used the rest of your portfolio with a VPW calculation to fund the rest. I believe this idea has been explored in that massive Bogleheads thread at some point. It's less appealing to me because the younger you are, the more expensive that guaranteed income is to purchase, which means you'd either be spending less or waiting longer to retire, so I'd rather take the higher expected return of the market and accept the risk that comes with that.\n\nBy efficiency I was more referring to the distribution of terminal portfolio values in SWR... you can often end up with double your initial value or more by the end. That pile of money may end up going to the long term care facility that serves you at the end, or it might be left to your heirs but at a point of their lives where they don't really need it. Ideally you'd rather spend that money on your quality of life while you can still have one, or give it to your kids at a time of their lives when it makes the most difference. In the end I'd guess most people are more flexible than the theoretical Trinity Study retiree anyway, so it's just a question of how you choose your flexibility.\n\nFor VPW% and AA, originally VPW started with tables that just tell you what to withdraw ([https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Variable\\_percentage\\_withdrawal](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Variable_percentage_withdrawal)). The preferred approach is now to use the spreadsheet and put in your numbers. There is a big potential gotcha here where the higher your equity allocation, the more it says you can withdraw. That's logical because the expected return is going up, so one might be tempted to say \"Well I'll have 90% equities and now I can spend more\". But of course, the risk is going up as well. That's why modeling what happens after an equity drop is important, because you'll find that even as higher equity allocations increase your \"allowed withdrawal\", they will lower your \"if shit hits the fan\" level. As a young retiree there is a tough decision to make, because VPW generally uses lower equity allocations to limit the downside, but 40+ year retirement periods generally require higher equity allocations. I have split the difference by going 75/25, but I can't endorse that beyond \"I think it will work out for my situation.\"", "There is no right or wrong answer here.

But nobody\u2019s retiring at 21 with $250,000 in the bank, especially with the other life and financial education we will hopefully provide her.", "I think one right answer is somewhere in the middle.  Two twists:\n\n1.  Gifts before bequeaths - I'm not saying anything new here, but the median age to receive inheritance is 51.  By the time I was 51, I was already fine financially and had no need of inheritance.  But earlier in life there were definitely key moments and stages where a lot of lost time could have been covered with more money.  Typical things to think about are: college, wedding, first-time home purchase, grandkids college, starting a business, etc.  So it's quite possibly to be legacy minded in a serious way, while also thinking in a \"Die with Zero\" mentality.  If my kids inherit a lot of money when they are 50, I probably should have given more earlier, to have more impact with my legacy.  (And get to enjoy watching it!)\n\n2.  Partitioning - a different approach to what I just said, for those who disagree with it for whatever reason, is to partition.  $X set aside today in separate investment accounts for each child, and then the rest is to spend.  One way to think about this for people who have a withdrawal rate of say 2% (very fortunate) is to say ok, half of this is for the kids to inherit some day, and half is for me on a 4% withdrawal rate.  If the market is bad in early years, then conceptually rebalance - sorry kids - and move enough back into the \"me\" bucket.\n\nThe advantage of doing this is that you can also partition how you manage the money.  The \"me\" bucket can be managed for *my* lifespan and time scale, I'm thinking here of the usual mix of bonds and stocks to manage the safety of the withdrawal rate.  The money that's for the kids, I can manage for their time scale, which probably means something more like 100% VT/VTI/VOO or whatever.\n\nIn this second approach I'd personally recommend it as a sort of \"coast fire\" for the kids.  \"Hey, kiddo, look here's this bucket of money and I'm sending you a copy of the statement every quarter, this is the money that's earmarked for your retirement, and here's what it's likely to be by the time of your retirement, and here's what a 4% rule looks like.  Now you can spend your money without worrying about retirement savings.\"", "This is a really great response.  Thanks for sharing.  \n\nPersonally, I\u2019m retired and am drawing a 1.6% SWR, so your #2 scenario resonates a bit.", "Die with zero.. child  (22) lives downtown in our capital city in a rent free studio. Will gift it them once SORR are gone (we are LeanFire).", "What is SORR?", "SORR = sequence of returns list.  I'll add more words to explain and /u/Captlard can correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nCapt. Lard here is \"leanfire\" which means, per the sidebar of the relevant sub /r/leanfire: \"FI/RE = Financially Independent / Retired Early - LeanFIRE = doing so with household expenses < $50k, or individual expenses < $25k\".\n\nSo the good Captain is not wealthy at all.  The issue with sequence of returns risk, especially critical for people who are Leanfire and therefore typically don't have a lot of discretionary spending in the plan, is that if the markets are terrible for the first few years of retirement, your required spending can eat into the nest egg in a pretty severe way, thus raising the probability of the money running out when old, which is a very bad thing indeed.\n\nIn most cases, within a few years (let's say 5-15 years) the original portfolio will have grown quite a lot so that the risk of running out of money is greatly diminished.   So what the Skipper is saying here is that in a few years, he'll feel comfortable enough that his money won't run out, so he can then gift the apartment to the kid.", "Sequence of returns risk", "This.

They paid for our college education so that we could start our working lives debt free, and years later helped us with down payments to buy our first homes - specifically so that we could make a larger down payments than we could on our own, and thus lower our monthly mortgage and have some flexibility and breathing room in our budgets when we had kids.\n\nBut part of these conversations always contained this message: *we are giving you this money now, when we feel it could make the most material impact on your lives, rather than (hopefully far in the future!) when you're in your 50s or 60s and we pass away.  So this is your \"*inheritance*\" - today, \\*instead of\\* decades from now.*\n\nThere is very likely not going to be any significant amount of money left when they pass away, specifically because they made these significant choices to make these bequests at earlier points in our lives.\n\nAnd that approach made a substantial difference in our lives, and readily set us up on the path towards FI.

We were on the path for FIRE (hence while I'm still subbed here), but a few years back decided we would rather have great memories of being active in our youth, that we can reminisce about when we are still working in our 50s/60s. We had the opportunity to live overseas while still working, and decided we would be foolish to live frugally. So we are spending money liberally on experiences and unique purchases. I'm sure 20 years from now I'll have no regrets.\n\n\nI will also say you should plan your trips to be longer than you need them to be. I see so many tourists rush to \"see\" a typical tourist site, take their picture and rush to the next site. I personally hate traveling like that. My wife and I like to pick one, maybe two things to do in a day of travel, and take our time getting \"lost\" and exploring things we see on our way to and from the big tourist sites. This is an argument for why it would be better to take a long sabbatical vice a short 1-2 week vacation. You can go to London for a couple days and see big Ben, or go to London/the UK for a month and really explore small neighborhoods, meet some locals, and see all the small sites.

The idea was to pay off my student loans as aggressively as possible.         \n**2011:** Moved to a vhcol city. Was living off $8 a day plus rent and utilities.      \n**2012:** Started my own software development business with 3 partners.     \n**2013-2014:** Agressively reinvested almost all profits into the business.     \n**2015:** Lost all our paying clients. Burned through hundreds of thousands of dollars in company savings since we refused to fire our employees. Injected personal capital.     \n**2016-2017:** Slowly got more work.    \n**2018:** Became the sole provider for a family of four in a vhcol area (4 people in 550sqft). Survived by transferring debt between 0% apr credit card offers. Financial stress kept me up most nights.     \n**2019:** Got married and had a baby. Realized my business income wasn't going to cut it. Quit my position at my business and got a job at a F100 company. Worked 60+ hr weeks but finally out of debt.     \n**2020:** Life is work, baby, housework. Bought a used car. Baby still wakes up multiple times a night so I get almost no sleep.    \n**2021:** Had another baby (sole provider for a family of 6 in vhcol).    Jumped to FAANG.  Spending got out of control but I didn't realize because I was working ~80 hour weeks and spending every available second with my kids. Sold my shares of my old business to my partners. Still no sleep.         \n**2022:** Moved 2hrs away from work and bought a house for 500k. Stock crashed hard so I got cheap RSUs. Kid is down to waking up once per night, I stop accidentally walking into walls.    \n**2023:** Still brutal work life balance but getting a bit better.     Focused on cutting costs.  Stock recovered. After four years my kid is FINALLY sleeping through the night.     \n**2024:** Still the sole provider. Established healthy boundaries at work, down to 40-50 hours a week and working on my stress levels.  Got rediculously lucky with RSUs and stock growth. Realistically this year is probably the most I'll ever make in my lifetime unless I make principal and survive at FAANG for at least 4-5 more years. Realized I'm stressing out about money to a really unhealthy extent, and that I should actually spend and enjoy some of what I've made.

When did you retire?", "I agree with all of your target reallocations.  I'm personally not in favor of even 5% in crypto, but with it hitting all time highs, no one is really ready to listen to me on that right now.  It's refreshing to see someone willing to profit-take and go down from 9.85% to ~5%.", "Totally a fair call. I haven't bought any in years (since before the previous bull run) and have no intention of doing so going forward \n\nIt's definitely closer to gambling than an investment.

If you lost 1% of your portfolio it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. But the upside is significant.", "I\u2019m curious, could you break down your crypto portion down further? Is it bitcoin or have you gone down the long tail of risk to the really risky coins?", "Fair enough.  Taking some profit off the table is good, and at least psychologically you can regard it all as \"free money\" whether it goes up or down.\n\nOf course, it isn't free money, it's real money, and there's another approach that says that if you wouldn't invest 5% of your networth in it at current valuations, you shouldn't hold 5% either.\n\nBut yeah, I'm just happy to see you cutting back to a degree under the circumstances.", "You could also put 1% into lottery tickets or the roulette table in Vegas.  If you lost 1% of your portfolio it wouldn't be a big deal, but the upside is significant.  The point is: I don't think that rationale makes a lot of sense.\n\nUnlike investing in companies, including fairly speculative plays like NVDA at the moment, is that BTC produces nothing.  Buying shares in a broad stock index fund is investing in a very wide range of companies who are producing value - taking inputs that are worth less, turning them into outputs that are worth more, and profiting from the difference.  The entire BTC ecosystem runs, by definition, at a net loss, due to all of the computing power that it costs to keep it all going.\n\nThe next issue is that of how rigged the BTC market is - a handful of whales, many of whom are already in major legal trouble for their dodgy activities - are pumping the market with unbacked Tether loans - this is a matter of public record, not a weird theory.  Tether prints up USD stable coins (which are stable... for now) and is lending them... to BTC whales.  The amount of insider trading, customer front running, etc. that goes on is absurd - again, this is a matter of public record, not a weird theory.\n\nThe next issue is that the original dream that BTC would become a new currency with real-world use cases such that we would all (globally) start using BTC to buy things in ordinary day-to-day life, online shopping, etc. - that idea has come and gone, because it's very obvious that the technology is not suitable for that use case.   Typical per-transaction fees on-chain, built into the network, are $5-$10.  (First 5 weeks of 2024 averaged $9.39.). That means you aren't about to start using it to buy coffee at the local coffee shop, even if there weren't insurmountable regulatory hurdles.\n\nThe final issue is the question of \"store of value\" - but it doesn't have any of the normal features one would expect to be a store of value in the long run.  \"The point of any store of value is risk management due to a stable demand for the underlying asset.\" For fiat currency, that demand is there and always will be due to *fiat* - I mean, at the very basics, the US government insists that you pay your taxes in dollars, therefore even if you try to move away from it and live a barter lifestyle, you have to buy dollars for that purpose or go to jail.  For other traditional stores of value such as land or gold, the stable demand for the underlying asset is also quite easy to understand.  With BTC, there's ultimately no demand for it *outside of the speculative use case*.\n\nI think there's a very good reason to look at the totality of the situation and realize that BTC is a bubble, a passing fad, and that it will in due course drop down to a valuation that is consistent with it's hobbyist use case - I would speculate that number to be $100-$1000 for the longterm, but of course that's just a seat of the pants guess.\n\nWhat's going to turn it around and send it crashing down, and when will that happen?  I don't know, I can't forecast the future.  The *when* especially is impossible to predict.  But the *what* isn't completely impossible to guess at - a sudden sharp decline in price of BTC, which has happened before, could catch out enough of the whales to cause Tether to become un-tethered to the dollar, which is going to have massive knock-on effects across the entire ecosystem.  \n\nI believe that a 51% attack gets easier and easier to do with the growth of holdings in ETFs, since those transactions don't necessarily go on-chain at all.  The way I see this happening is that the competitive pressure of transactions not needing to be on-chain reduces demand for on-chain transactions and therefore mining which will naturally result in a drop in mining fees, resulting in fewer miners and potentially more concentration in mining.  It's not hard to imagine a 51% attack to move Satoshi's coins, and then a mass selling campaign which would drive the price down of course but which would be massively profitable for the bad actor in the meantime.\n\nAll of this is my analysis, and you might disagree with a fair amount of it.  But \"number go up, ape buy more\" isn't really a proper counter-argument.\n\nI hope you find this helpful!", "These days I'm just in bitcoin and etherium.\n\nI never bought shit coins (though I did mine doge for a bit), but I did have litcoin xmr and xrp for a while.", "I hold no crypto and maintain a similarly anti-crypto attitude as you.\n\nHowever, the bubble has been going on for over a decade now. The Ponzi scheme has grown so large that banks are getting in on the action. It's hard to see a near-term future where there won't continue to be opportunities to personally profit off the situation.\n\nI will still stay far, far away because I find the whole crypto scene to be disgusting, but I understand why others would take a small part of their portfolio and gamble on it.", "Quite the write up! It\u2019s clear the people who oppose this is really an education problem. You have many misunderstandings of what bitcoin is and how it works. I too would be confused on why Bitcoin is valued where it is if I had the same understanding of the system as you do. \n\nLet\u2019s start with the lottery comment. This comparison is very flippant and is similar to people  (socialists) who compare the market itself as a lottery. Of course you and I understand the market is not a lottery. It\u2019s a weighing system to gage value of goods and services. \n\nBitcoin at its core is just a measurement tool. It\u2019s not a security, it\u2019s not a company, it\u2019s not meant to make an income, or be used as a commodity in manufacturing. It in itself is a ruler or scale, meant to represent value. Money itself doesn\u2019t have a yield, doesn\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d anything in the physical sense. Its job is to move value across time and space, an intermediary between two people wanting to trade. \n\nThe scale we currently use is the dollar. We trade our time, energy, and goods and services for a dollar (or some other fiat). The problem with this scale is it\u2019s always changing. It\u2019s designed to lose value at 2% but it\u2019s really debasing much faster than that especially in certain markets (those markets that are more scarce). The dollar excels as a unit of account and mostly a medium of exchange at least locally. Its downsides are a store of value, its risk of censorship or seizure, its middleman risk, and its ability to be used worldwide efficiently. \n\nBitcoin doesn\u2019t have this leakage and therefore is a much better store of value assuming demand constant (important). If the dollar at scale is compared to bitcoin at scale then bitcoin would clearly be a better store of value. Same with medium of exchange. If at scale you compared bitcoin to the dollar then bitcoin would be much more convenient for small and large transactions and across borders. The thing most people don\u2019t understand with medium of exchange is at scale you won\u2019t be using bitcoin on the base chain, rather like the internet it scales on higher layers trading permanent settlement with speed and cost. Like visa doesn\u2019t settle instantly, it settles at the end of the month in cash across intermediary banks. Bitcoin transactions are cheap and instant but would settle on the bitcoin blockchain at some interval (most likely less than a month).\n\nOf course if you compare bitcoin to the dollar today, one is fully developed and at its height whereas bitcoin is still growing. And that\u2019s the key, if you look at any metric whether it\u2019s volume or users or price it\u2019s all up and to the right. It\u2019s undeniable it\u2019s growing. If (and big if) it continues to grow in demand it\u2019s not unreasonable to compare it to money itself. Today bitcoin is like the 13th largest currency in the world. Or the 8th largest asset in the world. And it\u2019s still growing.\n\nPutting 5% of your net worth in possibly the future token of value itself is not a lottery ticket. It\u2019s a hedge. You might find it hard to believe the dollar would drop in value but all you have to do is compare the dollar to goods and services over a lifetime and it\u2019s lost 98% of its value. And it\u2019s being debased much faster today than the past. \n\nBitcoin is neutral, meaning no one country controls it (attractive to countries other than US), its global, tied to energy markets, transferable across the world in a instant, no counterparty risk, perfectly scarce, infinitely divisible, programmable, etc. it\u2019s just better money. It measures your value and energy without leakage. \n\nWhat we see today is highly volatile because it\u2019s an asset class undergoing global adoption. It comes in waves. Greshams law and history shows how this goes. People will hoard the good money and spend the melting money. At least until the melting money isn\u2019t accepted any further. \n\nNow the specific concerns you have like whales, the largest whales hold less as a percent of total money supply than today\u2019s billionaires. Tether has been shown to be fully backed by treasuries. They aren\u2019t printing money to prop up Bitcoin. They don\u2019t even hold that much Bitcoin. Like 60,000. Tether has been stress checked like no other institution or bank has. It\u2019s survived tens of billions of dollars in a bank run during Bitcoin bear markets and survived without losing its peg. It wouldn\u2019t be able to do that if it were mostly backed by Bitcoin or wasn\u2019t backed at all and was printing freely. \n\nAt the end of the day the market decides what has value and what doesn\u2019t. People clearly find value in Bitcoin at least so far. So much so that it\u2019s the best performing asset every year besides 3 for the last 15 years. \n\nSome people are speculating on the price. But for those who understand what it really is, isn\u2019t speculating on the price, they are speculating on the guarantee of dollars debasing and holding the most useful purest form of value.", "Pretty solid. I\u2019m with you. Most people in this sub are so against the risk curve. But positioned correctly it has an amazing risk reward curve. I did 1% of my portfolio in Bitcoin (still my only crypto) in 2015. It\u2019s now 60% of my portfolio. People who can\u2019t manage risk really shoot themselves in their foot. Congrats on your total portfolio. It\u2019s very impressive.", "It's not that big, as compared to the 2007-2008 financial crisis for example.", "Thank you!", "ow. 60% could disappear in a flash.

But I also can't discount how long and how deeply people can be stupid or bamboozled.\n\nMy hope is that the existing, relatively stable financial systems in first world countries continue to adapt and modernize, and BTC and the like fade into irrelevance when people realize they are not a good long-term growth investment and also terrible at being a currency.", "My man don\u2019t fret. It still only cost me 1%. If I lose it all I would just be back to where this sub recommends me to be anyway lol. Having never invested in bitcoin in the first place. It\u2019s not like I stopped investing in 401k, Roth, and realestate. 99% of my income and net worth went into those three things. It\u2019s just that they continue to underperform. \n\nIt\u2019s not a lottery tickets though. It\u2019s a calculated risk after a deep amount of research and study. I didn\u2019t invest 1% lightly. The odds were in my favor which was very different than a lottery ticket. I implore you to do the homework yourself and understand why against all mainstream guidance, bitcoin keeps going up. At some point you have to admit the guidance you hear from subs like this and personal finance are missing something. The key something.", "I get it. My real estate is like 80% of my net worth, I can't catch up to it with my equities but I've just freed up a bunch of cash flow now so I can buy into the market faster.

If you worked all 52 weeks at 65 hours a week on average while earning $19k, that means your hourly wage was roughly $5.60/hr.\n\nEven if you maxed out an IRA that still means you were only making around $7/hr before taxes.

So at the end of the day building things and running a team was only one part of what I actually did. And throughout it all I was making a fraction of what I could have elsewhere. \n\nThere were some really cool parts too though. Beyond being my own boss I got to choose what projects I wanted to take on, align them with my personal values and interests, and we tried incubating multiple internal ideas. Plus when it was time to start winding things down when I left we could give everyone three months of severance. Still felt bad about it, but that's way more humane than most places will give you.

If it's a 2-3 hour layover in an airport I don't mind spending time in, I'll happily save a few hundred bucks and do the layover.\n\n> Leaving from an airport that's cheaper to get to?\n\nThis isn't really an option for me, as my city only has one major airport - but again it depends on cost and time. I generally find myself struggling with paying for parking at the airport or using an Uber, but that's easier math - if the trip is longer than a week the Uber is always cheaper, otherwise I like having my car waiting for me when I get back.\n\n> Avoiding a middle seat?\n\nI don't care that much unless it's an international flight.

My local airport is ten minutes from the house, there is a massive airport about three hours from my house. Is the cost of direct outweighed by the extra driving, and what is impact on Total time spent traveling. In an environment with limited time/money, there is an opportunity cost to both, so rationalize what makes sense for your situation.\n\nI never check luggage, but there are some considerations/risks about checking bags on non-direct flights. It's not hard for human error to have your luggage not arrive where it supposed to.\n\nI'm a big human but I am always willing to suffer a middle seat rather than pay for the upgrade (different story if work is paying). It's not that inconvenient. I just sat middle on a fourteen hour flight and it wasn't the best time of my life, but also I wasn't about to drop $100 to get an aisle. I don't upgrade to business class either, the premium tends to cost a lot more and is not worth it to me (would've been about $3k to upgrade on the flight I just took, wtf).\n\nI usually start with Skyscanner to get an informed opinion of what airlines are flying the lane I'm trying to purchase and broadly what price range I'm looking at. Then I go to the airline website for actual pricing. I don't see a reason to commit to a specific airline. Some are definitely better than others, but I'd rather fly lowest price, then fastest lane. Name on the plane doesn't matter too much to me. The flight is usually a fairly small part of the entire trip.\n\nI use the BoA travel card, which at 2.53% is best in class for Cashback unless you are pulling out a ton of different cards. To me the juice isn't worth the squeeze trying to optimize past that. Whatever card you are using is fine - it's a vacation don't worry about optimizing an extra $10...\n\nRather than worry about departure time, I would think about arrival time. Depending on where you are going, it can really stink to arrive outside of business hours / daylight. There is a huge convenience factor here, and sometimes a safety factor. And pricing tends to not correlate with time, and I'm a price-focused shopper.\n\nRelated - and this depends a lot on where you are traveling from/to - but I find the biggest cost drivers are airfare, lodging, car rental, and potentially food (looking at you Iceland..). Finding a balance that makes sense for your total trip budget is important. If you are going luxury on the lodging maybe cut back on the flight. If you are going to be camping, maybe you are willing to spend a bit more for a better flight option. It's worth taking a step back and figuring out what is important to you and what (if anything) needs to be rationalized so you achieve your trip goals.\n\nHave a blast on your trip!!", "Look at parking cost as well at airport.

I have no debt. All in all, the net worth is close to $500k.\n\nLiving in the EU. My current net income is $93k. I'm actually down on income because I took a lower paying job for the opportunity of learning some people skills, which is valuable for my development,  but I'm also currently looking to go back into DevOps (could take <2 months). That would move the needle to \\~$145k net income (previous max net income was $132k). My contributions to retirement are maxed out.

From what I've been told, the effective cost of the loan would be 10-12%. That's basically an average of $850 spent a year on interest alone. That means I'd have to pay $1600 a month on the loan itself. Instead of saving/investing $5600 a month, I'd only invest $3800/month on the current income.\n\nWhat do you think?

Assume a tax rate based on your ability to withdraw just what you need and no more. So you need to adjust this expense number up by the tax rate. this tells you your target in current dollars. So looking at your investments, assume a real return rate (average return - average inflation) - to project  how much of the amount you have saved and will have if you continue your current saving rate.\n\nUsually there are a few caveats to this - adjust for time limited expenses that will eventually go away. if you have a mortgage, that will end  at some time - so  you might want to account for that - either by paying it off before retiring or adjusting your retirement amount to account for paying it off at some point.

So the actual number will be much higher by the time you get to retirement.", "It's in today's dollars.  As your spending increases with inflation (or with lifestyle creep if you get raises and don't save the whole difference, or just intentionally change to spend more) your FI number will have to go up (though it should not change much in constant dollars if you keep roughly the same lifestyle.).\n\nAs far as worrying about Roth vs. Regular money, I would not bother with that in that way, unless you are going to be retiring with a very high spend rate or save way past your FI number.\n\nAt 80k spend, even if you are single with most of your money in traditional IRAs, you'll have a pretty low effective tax rate, and if you're married, you might pay almost nothing in federal. \n\nIt's generally best for most medium to medium high income FIRE savers to just max out all your traditional deductible savings, then Roth or backdoor as much of the rest as you can, then save in a taxable brokerage, and then just use the full numbers.  Model out your taxes based on what you have and will likely be drawing in retirement and add what's necessary to your spend rate before calculating the FI number.\n\nHaving more in Roth will reduce the amount you have to add for taxes.   But if you live in a low/no income tax state and are spending less than ~50k per adult, unless you have most/all your money in deductible 401k/IRAs, you might pay close to zero tax in retirement.\n\nFinally I would completely ignore statements about how much of your income you should have saved by certain ages.   These are only applicable (to some extent if they are designed reasonable) to people on a very standard retirement track, who save a reasonable amount from the moment they earn real money and don't play to retire until their mid 60s.\n\nIf you got a slow start, or had some financial woes early on, you might be way behind in those metrics, but saving enough now to catch up and pass all the \"standard\" folks pretty quickly.   OTOH, with a modest savings rate like 15%, you could also be well \"ahead\" in those metrics around age 40, but not far enough ahead to retire very early, rather than at 60+.\n\nThe key to focus on is your savings rate -- what percent of the money you make after taxes do you save and invest vs. spend.   And then, how much you've already saved and invested vs. your FI number (25 or 30 or whatever times spending).   And you can combine these with a simple time value calculation and estimate of inflation adjusted returns to find your \"years to FI\".\n\nSavings rate tells you how fast a path you are on, and how much you already have saved tells you how far you are already (and how much your future savings matters relative to past savings).    Finally years to FI is the number you probably care about most.\n\nLast but not least, when considering budgeting or one time expenses, it's useful to know your true income per hour.   Take what you make, subtract taxes that you don't have any (or very limited) control over spending once you make it, and any costs that are associated purely with working. For instance if you have a commute consider the mileage as car costs, if you have a work wardrobe that you would not wear otherwise, consider those expenses.  If you pay union dues, or need a fancy car or go out to expensive lunches, join a country club or whatever to fit in at work or with clients, etc. subtract any of those expenses that you wouldn't have in retirement, like they are business expenses.   Then add up your actual work hours, and also all other hours that are devoted to and depend on your work.  Commuting time, time you spend on homework while home, if any, etc.   Finally divide that up to get your true hourly rate.    This is the rate you should consider as a fair trade to hire a worker to do something you could do just as well/quickly as them and hate/enjoy about as much as your job). \n\nThis is also the number you should think about when you consider new expenses -- translate them into hours at your true hourly rate.    Better yet, translate them into a rough proxy for \"work hours until FI\" by using your hourly rate multiplied by your savings rate. \n\nSo let's say you make 100k per year at a full time job.  That's ~50 per hour by the standard reckoning.  But realistically you work more like 50+ hours a week and even after accounting for paid vacation and sick time you're probably at more like 45/hour.   but you've also got taxes and a 30 minute commute two ways 5 days a week.   That commute is an extra 5 hours a week and probably costs ~4-5k in loaded mileage cost (more if you normally drive a newer, expensive or inefficient car).  Figure you are single and no kids, max your deductible 401k and save another 6k in Roth or taxable accounts, and live in an average income tax state. That means you're paying close to 20k in taxes.   So you actually earn 100k - 20k tax - 5k commute costs, and we'll assume that there are no other real costs to working for you -- that means you make 75k after tax, and to do this, you work an average of 50 hours a week (including commute time).  That means your true hourly rate is about $30/hour rather than 50!\n\nIf you are doing what I suggested, you'd have a savings rate of around 35%.  This means that your hours to FI conversion is about $10.5/hour.\n\nthat means for every 10.50 you spend, you're eventually going to have to work an additional hour to get to retirement (to save the same money you would have if you didn't spend it). \n\nThis is actually a rough proxy that's most accurate when you aren't yet very close to FI.  The closer you are to FI, the less small one time expenses will matter. \n\nbut bear in mind that's for *one-time* spending.   If you think about spending that you want to do regularly, that will increase your FI number too. \n\nThat's what I would focus on.  Compare different jobs by looking at expected *true* hourly rate, not headline salary (i.e. account for commute time and expenses, expected overtime, tax differences and other uncompensated costs.

Officially crossed the 500k mark last week and am now at 515k. It's been a wild ride and it still doesn't feel real. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst off - I have been very blessed. I grew up in a upper middle class house and my dad was always frugal which I picked up from an early age. My parents paid for my bachelors degree so I was able to graduate college with only a reasonable amount of debt from my one year masters. I've always loved money and have always wanted to build a sizeable nest, just didn't expect to make it here this early. I was always a huge saver since a very young age, starting with saving my $0.60 of snack money instead of buying a nutty cone everyday at school. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI still am a huge saver and a majority of my money goes into my brokerage. A majority of my investments are in single stocks for my brokerage and IRA / 401k are ETFs / mutual funds (100% equity). I have an enormous risk tolerance since I am at a young age, and have certainly had my fair share of losses from \"gambles\" in the market, but overall I think I have had solid returns in the last 5 years. I work in finance and really enjoy researching stocks, so even if I don't outperform the benchmarks, I still enjoy doing it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome of you might question how I got to 500k given I have only been working for less than 5 years with only a few years of high income earning, and the answer to that is that I have had an incredible run in sports betting, and have profited $205k since I began betting a couple of years ago, with most of this coming in the last 15 months. I spend an enormous amount of time on this during the September-March months, and it can be mentally draining. Sometimes it makes you numb to money when you can win or loss 5k on any given day. I want to spend less time on this since it can take a toll on your dopamine levels and make you enjoy the little things in life less, but it is also very difficult to get away from. Certainly something I need to work on going forward and I cannot wait for the end of March Madness since that will be the start of my betting break until college football. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for what's next, I am looking for jobs that will give me a better work life balance, which will come with a pay cut. I need something more sustainable as I am not necessarily planning to retire anytime soon, but I want something where I can eventually work \\~30 hours a week with a lot of flexibility to allow me to pursue some additional streams of income.

I started my career in a LCOL in my hometown making 50k a year. I was living at home so I was able to save basically my entire take home pay. I was not tracking my net worth at this time but I paid off as much debt as possible and probably finished the year with a 20k net worth. \n\n**2020** \\- Got a slight pay bump to 58k. Covid hit and began working from home full time. I was actively looking for new jobs at this point but covid made it difficult. I started looking to buy a house but was ultimately getting outbid on everything. Continued to live at home and was able to save and invest most of my money and pay off the rest of my debt. I had a good year in the market, like everybody, and probably finished the year with a net worth around \\~70k  (going off memory alone, I think I made \\~30k realized gain in trading options this year)\n\n**2021** \\- A big year for me, as I got a new job in a VHCOL city. My new salary was \\~140k and I was able to continue to live at home since the job was still remote for the time being. I was able to live in a LCOL at  home for 6 months while making a VHCOL salary which was awesome. I made the move to the new city in the summer and got an even higher paying job towards the end of the year, with a salary of \\~170k. Can't recall my ending net worth this year, but I lost a shit ton of money in the stock market in the second half of the year. I would guess my net worth was just over 100k. \n\n**2022 -** Continued to work the same job and made \\~185k in income. Began sports betting this year and made about 20k. Tough year in the stock market. Was saving a lot less of my paycheck since I was living in a VHCOL city but was still able to save up a decent amount. I started tracking my NW and finished the year close to 200k.\n\n**2023 -** Continued at the same job but was promoted and making \\~225k. Incredible year of sports betting and good year in the stock market. Started saving a lower % of my paycheck and started to enjoy life more and spending more money on things to make my life more convenient. Started to value my time more and more. Started tracking my NW on an almost daily basis and finished the year with a NW of 433k\n\n**2024 -** Still at same job and will have a similar salary to last year.

Get your spending down and then put that excess into your IRAs to max yearly, then max your 401k.", "Half of that is mortgage + daycare (another 2 years to go). We could cut a bit in eating out and plan groceries better, but I was able to cut some and make some progress in the last quarter or so. I\u2019ll take another closer look! The ~9,000 also includes the retirement/529 savings, like I mentioned. So I do know where the money is going :)", "I have done several changes.. a few.. eating out vs take out saved me at least 15$ with each meal (no tipping or low tipping as this is getting out of control).\n\nAlso, buying prepackaged meals in Deli vs fast food  saved money and better health.\n\nAvoid too many grocery runs, instead make a list, spend two hours and get them all at one shot saved a ton on gas.\n\nI have more if you want....", "If you take daycare and your 529/retirement savings out of the expenses, how much remains?  That will be a useful number, because in retirement you (ideally) won't be doing either of those.  That'll give you a number that you can multiply by 12 (for your yearly spending) and then by 25 to get your FI number.\n\nWhat's that number end up being?  And how do you feel about that?  If that number doesn't seem more feasible for your savings plans, that'll be where you'll want to start looking for places where you could cut your expenses - either now or once you finally retire!", "9,000 a month seems about $30-45k less than your take home net of taxes.  I don\u2019t generally like telling people how to spend money as there isn\u2019t a right answer to life, but do make sure you really know where it\u2019s all going.", "Mortgage + utilities + credit card (which is pretty much everything else\u2014food/groceries/gas/misc) is about $6500, so $78,000 and $1.9MM. \n\nPutting this way, it\u2019s a much clearer way to see where I need to be. Based on online calculators, both of us combined are at least very closed to that. I guess as the youngest gets into public school and we have that extra money, we should be able to beef the accounts up! Thanks!", "It\u2019s all good, I asked for the advice :)\n\n$9000 is an average number. Some months we have a Costco run, or the kids need clothes, or we sign them up for a sport, medical deductible, etc. And we are still adding to the HSYA on a monthly basis (whatever is left for that paycheck goes into that account). And we have a small vacation sinking fund, too. But absolutely, like someone said here, there is always room for improvement!", "That is great news!  Keep rocking it!", "if 9k is average, that is $108k per year, leaves a lot more that could be adding to your net worth.  Find out where it\u2019s going and make sure you\u2019re comfortable spending on those things.\n\nagain, spending money is fine, but money leaking away generally isn\u2019t great.", "There's is always room for improvement but you are already mostly doing the right things I think! Lots of people (most people?) are way further behind than you. Stick with the plan, the plan is working. Also to your question, yes the best thing to do is to max out tax advantaged accounts. Brokerage and accelerated mortgage payment might make sense after that. I think the biggest pitfall to avoid would be lifestyle inflation.", "When kids are out of daycare double down on retirement.", "Yes, can\u2019t wait to have the extra money!", "You're getting close to the Roth IRA income limit for couples. At your income level it's probably wiser to increase the traditional 401K and make sure to max out the HSA. Be sure to include any employer matches when calculating your 401K. \n\n[This](https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/retirement-plan-calculator/) is a pretty useful calculator. I use 0% wage increase, 0% inflation, 7% returns, and that you \"need\" 75% of your income in retirement to get a rough idea. Given you won't have kids or a mortgage your needs will be lower, probably lower than 75% but that high baseline makes for better planning. Based on your stats, assuming no company match, you should be \"fine\" to retire at 62 or 65. This is one thing where I think overkill is worthwhile. It's better to have twice as much as you need than half. I'd increase the contributions. The more you save while you're still relatively young, the better.", " Very useful! I saved the link :)", "I think you are doing pretty well and just stay on the course. You started your FIRE journey at 29 and that was not late. Many folks I know didn't have a real job until mid-30 and didn't know about FIRE until late 40s or even 50s.", "This is standard r/PF kind of question\n\n1. Contribute to 401k to get full company match\n\n2. Max HSA if you have it\n\n3. Max out Roth IRA (backdoor if needed)\n\n4. Max out 401k\n\n5.

Put on your own oxygen mask before helping others", "Here\u2019s my take away.. you moved here with nothing and you\u2019ve built an amazing life! You have a strong financial future and if you were to work another 20 years you could still retire early!\n\nKeep it up, save hard, invest well. With the solid start you have and your strong income. I bet you could retire in 10-15 years. \n\nI\u2019d recommend maxing out any tax advantaged accounts you have available as you can. As long as you have access to good investments, don\u2019t worry too much about which account you start with. \n\nAgain, you\u2019re doing great! You can do this!", "Thanks, that\u2019s very kind of you :)", "With the recent Mint shutdown I moved to a new finance tracker/aggregator and realized the number of accounts I have is getting a little out of hand. I've switched jobs a couple of times and each time adds a new retirement account.\n\nAlmost a year ago I switched from a job in tech to a non-profit. The non-profit job came with a 403(b) that I've been contributing to. I haven't rolled over my 401(k) from my previous job into to my 403(b) yet, but I'm wondering if I should. Both my 401(k) and 403(b) have similar index funds available with similar expense ratios. In both accounts, the bulk of my balance is in an S&P 500 tracking fund with a 0.015% expense ratio.\n\nAre there any advantages to a 401(k) that a 403(b) doesn't have or vice versa? I suppose I should mention here that my 403(b) has a Roth option, but I'm not using it because I'm pretty sure my taxable income in retirement will be much lower than in my working years.\n\nIs there any time limit on rolling over a retirement plan from a previous employer to a new employer? Like do I need to hustle and do it before my one year anniversary at my current (new) job passes?\n\nDoes having my money spread across different banks provide any benefit? Like would having $250k in two separate banks result in $500k of FDIC coverage while having $500k in one bank result in $250k of funds without FDIC coverage?\n\nAssuming that both accounts have equivalent fund choices and expense ratios, is there anything else I should consider? Like if one company is more likely to become insolvent than the other or anything like that?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice.", "It's plan dependent. Does your 403b accept funds rolled into it from a 401k? I'd call the 403b investment firm and ask them. The only real benefit would be if the 403b has better fund options but you said they're about the same. It is easier to keep track of it. \n\nI have 9 separate retirement accounts since I've never gone through the trouble to roll over.", "Lol wow, 9 is a lot! Are all 9 different logins? Or are some of the accounts with the same provider?", "Yeah they are group. 3 with Fidelity, 2 Vanguard, 2 TIAA, 1 Empower, plus a Schwab non qualified plan. Those are the employer related accounts. \n\nI also have a Schwab taxable account, Roth IRA, HSA and rollover IRA. And a 529 but it's not for me. I use an Excel spreadsheet and PersonalCapital to track everything.", "OMG, that still sounds like a lot to keep track of!", "You are paying admin fees on 9 different accounts.", "I'd be paying fees on one account too if everything was together (which I can't because 3 of those are 457s).\n\nI looked and last year I paid $124 for the year on about $1.4 million. I'm ok with that.", "Why roll them over to an employer plan rather than an IRA account at a broker of your choice like Fidelity or Schwab? Fees will be lower, and more options.", "Do not recommend this option as you'll basically lose the option to do a backdoor Roth.", "I recommend this. \n\nThose employer retirement accounts may be safe but you miss out on so much more profit you can get from self directed IRA.", "Which finance tracker/aggregator did you move to?", "To Empower. It's ok. Not as good as Mint, but free and good enough.", "I did a lot of research on this last year only to find out that it wasn't possible to roll over my 403b into any other type of account without taking all the early withdrawal tax penalties. So my advice is to look into that first!", "Pretax-to-pretax and Roth-to-roth rollovers are not considered withdrawals or distributions, and generally do not incur taxes or penalties.", "I'm seeing that it's possible to roll a 403(b) into a 401(k) if I were to switch jobs to a job with a 401(k).", "You left the job with the 403b? I was able to roll it over to a rollover ira after I left my job with a 403b.", "Yes I couldn't do exactly that!
