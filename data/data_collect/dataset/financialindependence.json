If you\u2019re not comfortable with that, don\u2019t take the survey. Whenever possible, identifying information (such as age) is obscured in ranges.

Throughout the survey each section includes instructions at the top of the page as well. \r  \n\r  \nThe survey will take approximately 20 minutes to complete, depending on how prepared you are with your numbers. \r  \n\r  \nEnter all annual information for calendar year 2023 (January 1 \u2013 December 31, 2023).  Enter all point in time data (like account balances) as of December 31, 2023 (or as close thereto as you can get).  \r  \n\r  \nEnter all amounts in *current* dollars (or your native currency).\r  \n\r  \nThe survey asks how many people contribute to your household finances, and thereafter your responses should include all assets, debt, etc. belonging to those people.  You determine the number of people who contribute to your finances. Demographic questions include demographics for \"contributor 2\" and \"contributor 3\", if you have more than one person contributing to your household income, you can include their demographic information there. \r  \n\r  \nRemember that personal finance is personal.  Enter your numbers as you interpret them, personally.  If you really get stuck, I will be watching this thread and answering interpretation questions as able.  Because personal finance is personal, some buckets may not be precisely consistent with your personal buckets.  \r  \n\r  \nYou are able to return to the survey and edit your answers later if needed; just skip to the end and submit to get your return link. \r  \nThe survey will be available for the entire month of April.  \r  \n\r  \nEnter dollar amounts as a whole number, appropriately rounded.  E.G. $32,594.56 is entered as 32595.\r  \n\r  \nEnter percentages as a number, not a decimal. For example, 4% is entered as 4 (not .04), 20.5% is entered as 20.5 (not .205), etc.  \r  \n\r  \nDo *not* use symbols for dollars ($) or percentages (%).  \r  \n\r  \nAt the end of the survey, you will be asked for any comments on the survey.  If you had any confusion or issues with a question, please refer to it in your comments by the question number plus a brief description of the question (question numbers change depending on your circumstances). Because the survey does not ask for identifying information, I will not be able to follow up with you, so please be as specific as you can about the issue or difficulty you encountered. \r  \n\r  \nAlmost all questions are skippable; if a question does not apply to you or you haven't yet determined the answer, skip it.   \r\n\nThe survey will ask for an approximation of the cost of living for your area, use this [Co](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_current.jsp)[st of Living Index](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_current.jsp) and get as close as you can.

Considering my wife and I are not able to max out both our 401ks and our Roth IRAs, would it ever be a good idea to overpay on our mortgage payments? Seeing how little I will pay down over the next 10 years by paying the minimum is pretty disconcerting, but I'm not sure if it financially makes sense to ever make any additional payments as opposed to just putting whatever I can into retirement instead.\n\nFor the record, my mortgage is $380k at a 6.65% rate, and I currently contribute about 22% of my salary to retirement each yeah (including employer match).\n\nThanks for any help!"}, {"comment_text": "Amortization schedules can look depressing, but that is how the loan works.  I would learn to ignore that and do the best you can for new money.\n\nA principle payment on your mortgage is like making a known 6.65% into perpetuity.  What might somewhat affect that outlook is the fact that you're pretty likely to refinance back into at least the 5s but that's not helping much today.  What it doesn't do is help reduce your monthly cash flow requirements (i.e. recasting your mortgage won't do much unless you paid off a significant amount.)  Certainly this is decent option.\n\nMoney into pre-tax gives immediate today-dollars benefit in the form of taxes saved.  Probably this is also going into stock investments.  So whatever is \"better\" is somewhat subject to market returns because the investment is fundamentally different (fixed \"bond\" versus stocks) but there's a clear difference in what it means for you in 2023.\n\nIf your marginal rate is 22%, putting $1000 into your pretax 401K subtracts $220 from your tax bill.  Paying down your mortgage reduces your interest cost by $66.50.  Then hopefully that savings compounds better as a stock investment than as a loan payoff as well.\n\nNote that in the future my tax bill will not likely be zero but at the same time, it won't be 22%.  I estimate roughly 10% for myself so that's still a $120 benefit.\n\nI'm a big fan of the biggest immediate benefit.  Pre-tax is future tax liability but this is kind of a \"bird in hand\" problem where I'd rather have that money on my books and let future me deal with those taxes.  Especially if the problem statement includes not being able to max pre-tax, I'm not assuming a complicated future.  I think it's fair to analyze correctly but under present tax structure, there a lot of guardband for most people to assume pre-tax is best.\n\nThe one thing someone might be concerned about above what's financially optimal is appropriate emergency fund/etc if being too aggressive on retirement.  But if you feed it into reducing your mortgage balance, it's likely harder to get that back if you have some financial emergency situation, and you'll still owe your regular mortgage payment.", "reply_text": "Great comment, thank you so much for the detailed info."}, {"comment_text": "Please use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new post to the sub.

Housing is influenced by a lot of factors, not just interest rates or new builds.  \n\nHuge investment companies or foreign investors outbidding single family buyers and buying up real estate and and holding as rentals and investments is a huge factor.\n\nAirbnb conversion is a factor as well.  \n\nI always use the 99 people and 99 chair example.

Its complex and has lots of factors, but my point is that influencing just 1 chair, or a tiny % of the market can drastically effect supply/demand and skyrocket prices.  Even if you argue airbnb, investors are a small change in how the housing market operates, that small influence can be the tipping point to drive massive housing price increases (spoiler, they have had more than a small influence on the housing market over the last 10 years in overall home turnover.  If airbnb was shut down and SFH were protected from investor groups, you'd see a crash worse than 2007-8 and a market flooded beyond what is necessary for the population) \n\nMy point is interest rates are one factor on housing prices and I wouldn't start with modifying interest rates to regulate home prices.

Making my interest 4.5%. I also have a personally loan from Wells Fargo that I took to help fund my college expenses that was 10k but with an interest of 11.6% it is sitting at about 12.5k total now. \n\nI also recently totaled my car due to an accident that was not my fault. I received 8k for this accident and used 2k of it down on a new 2024 Honda HRV for $28,800. My monthly payment on the car is 453 dollars and the insurance is 157 a month. \nI also have 2 credit cards with about 500 dollars in total between them both.

And I do not know much about how 401k works in general. I've heard some of my family members to put my 6% into a Roth and have the company put it into a standard 401k, but unsure. Any advice or guidance on this would be appreciated. \n\nI have around 5k sitting in my checking account unsure of what to do with it.

If you get rid of it within the next 5 years it will graduate to being downright stupid. What's the interest rate and payoff schedule?\n\nThe most important thing you can do right now is not spend too much money. Lifestyle inflation will come, but having it come slowly is critically important. There is no limit to the amount of money people can spend, and that includes you. The path from \"78k is a drastic increase in income\" to \"78k is barely enough to survive on\" can be less than a year, if you're not careful.\n\nCreate a budget, and track your expenses. The budget will be extremely wrong and need to be updated regularly. That's fine. It's important to get the mechanism down, and to understand where you're money is going. In another few years you'll be able to accurately project expenses.\n\nAn emergency fund is a good thing to have. At your age and with parents nearby, I'd recommend 3 months of expenses.

You should beef this up to your *new* monthly expenses (including rent and bills) before moving out.\n\nFor 401(k), put 6% in Roth, as advised. Roth is what you should do when you're making relatively less money, like at the start of your career. The company's match will always be after-tax. (Technically there's 3 types of 401(k)s - Roth, Traditional, and after tax. Pretending that after tax is the same as Traditional is close enough to true. There are some subtle differences, mostly around yearly limits and IRA conversions.)\n\nIn your 401(k), select a low-fee (aka low expense ratio) broad-market fund. Or collection of funds. I wouldn't recommend any bonds at your age - the standard advice is here: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio. (I do 75% US, 25% int'l, 0% bonds. You could get a PhD in the exact balancing.)\n\nNever pay interest on a credit card. Set your cards up to autopay the full statement balance every month. This is optimal for both your credit score and for the amount of money it costs you.\n\nI would say only pay the minimums on the 4.5% loans should have their minimums paid. Your immediate priority is that Wells Fargo loan at 11.6%. You absolutely should not move out until that is gone.", "reply_text": "Personally, I disagree on your comments regarding the vehicle.

I don\u2019t have the experience to budget for the years of supporting a family while in retirement. \n\nAverage tuition cost today is about $26k/year X 4 years x 3 kids = $310k. Add another $18k/year for student housing, books, etc. X 4 years x 3 kids = $216k. So -$526k over 9 years - and those are very conservative numbers.

In machine learning, this is the exploration versus exploitation trade-off. As a general rule, you need to first explore things. As time progresses, you may find things that work so well (i.e. that you enjoy so much) that exploring other things feels like a waste of time. Then, you are shifting from exploration into exploitation.\n\nIf you build up too much pressure for yourself with impressive sounding goals like \"write a novel\" or \"compose a symphony\" during your work years, you are setting yourself up for disappointment in the first year of retirement.

If not, where's the other $399k of liabilities that's not showing up?\n\nI agree with the chorus that you should be doing a traditional 401k at that income level.\n\nYou can absolutely retire in your 40s on this plan. \n\nLooking over your expenses, you'll need a paid-off house and about $105k after-tax a year (general expenses + non-mortgage housing costs + non-income taxes). $83k of capital gains comes tax-free, and the rest you can pull from Roth contributions for a while, so you'll be avoiding taxes for a lot of retirement. I'll round up to $120k for safety anyway.\n\n4% rule means $3M in equities for $120k withdrawal. At $100k/year input on a base of $500k in equities and the standard 7% inflation-adjusted gain, you'll cross that threshold in 12 to 13 years. Call it 14 to account for paying off the mortgage around when you retire.\n\nThis is all done with today's dollars. If you stick to this plan and inflation averages 3%/year, then you'll have $4.5M and withdrawal $180k in 2038 dollars.

I mainly want to call attention to the difference between your total net worth and your FIRE portfolio.\n\nTotal net worth is everything you own minus everything you owe.  It's a useful figure to know!\n\nYour portfolio is what you'll draw your living expenses from in retirement.  This is generally going to be investments and a bit of cash.  It normally doesn't count assets like your house or your cars, since you probably don't plan to sell them to cover living expenses, and they won't reliably appreciate, so the 4%(ish) rule can't be applied to them.\n\nI just want to call out that the 4% rule and most related math is based on market returns... i.e., index funds.  Even within investments, be careful counting money in individual stocks or managed funds.  I'm not saying \"All managed funds and all individual stocks are bad!\"  Just that they're often harder to predict returns for, so they carry increased risk over broad market, low cost index funds.  I personally own entirely index funds, and it's been going very well, but to each their own on portfolio construction.\n\nOf course some amount of your portfolio will likely be cash, and as long as that's like 12 months or less while working, and 18-36 or less once retired, all good to count as part of the portfolio.\n\nA lot of people have a lot of feelings on bitcoin.  It's speculation, IMO, but it's not necessarily bad speculation during accumulation.  I wouldn't count bitcoin towards a portfolio value though, save for what you plan to move to index funds in retirement.  Until it's moved to more stable investments, bitcoin and other crypto is just fun money... it can turn chubby-FIRE to fat-FIRE, but shouldn't be relied on IMO.\n\nIf you do plan to downsize your house in retirement, there's an argument to count some portion of its value towards your FIRE portfolio.\n\nDetails aside, if you keep saving 50% of your post tax income, retiring by 45 should be cake.\n\nGood luck!"}, {"comment_text": "EDIT: Fixed some dumb mistakes - thanks for pointing them out!\n\nThrowaway account - tried to summarize situation as succinctly as possible below and included thoughts/questions at the end.\n\nEager to hear any/all feedback - thank you!\n\n# ----\n\n# Age + Background\n\n* I'm 28 and my fianc\u00e9e is 30 - we'll call me Bob and my fianc\u00e9e Alice.

What's a reasonable/conservative way to forecast these things over multiple decades?\n* Each year, retirement account contribution limits will probably get adjusted upward for inflation (but fail to fully capture its impact), tax rates may change, and certain types of expenses may inflate more than others. What are some good ways to handle these nuances when forecasting?\n\n**And last but not least - I'm hoping it's reasonable for us to retire sometime in our 40s if we can continue increasing our income and our investments perform reasonably well. Does this seem doable for us?**\n\nThank you in advance for your help!", "reply_text": "It looks like you are calculating your home as if it has a negative contribution to your net worth. Am I reading that correctly?\n\nIf someone buys a house for $500K and pays $100K for a down payment, the asset = $500K, liability = $400K, and equity = $100K.  The home thus represents $100K in net worth. You should ignore any future mortgage interest expense in your net worth calculation.\n\nOne obvious reason to do this is because you are mixing present and future time values; you're using the present time period to value your cash on hand, stock investments, home, etc, but you're using a future time value for your mortgage interest expense (the last of which won't be paid for 28.5 years)."}, {"comment_text": "Thanks - this was one of my confusions.

However, with their new limitation to three transactions (unless you pay for Pro), my patience waned. My quest for an alternative began, only to find myself entangled in a web of apps that were either too clunky, too restrictive, or too ad-heavy.\n\nFrom Splid only being available via an app, to Tricount retiring its web app, and Settle Up hiding essential features behind a paywall, none met my criteria. I just wanted a simple & efficient way to split expenses while being able to categorize them for accurate spending in YNAB, especially as a dedicated YNAB user since 2012.\n\nspliit.app is close and I love that its open source, but it still doesn't have everything I need. Also, having to click so many times to enter transactions one by one keeps me from using it.\n\n\n# \ud83d\udcbc My Edge Case: YNAB Split Transaction Category Reconciliation\n\nAs someone who meticulously categorizes every penny in YNAB (and has since 2012), I found no service that allowed me to accurately reflect my **spending or owed amounts BY category in split transactions** and/or allow me to quickly enter lots of transactions at once as I often do. The existing options either required far too many clicks, required me to register for an account, were behind a paywall, or lacked the necessary detail for me to categorize my spending correctly.\n\n# \ud83d\udd28 So, I Built My Own Solution\n\nFrustrated but motivated, I turned to Google Sheets and Google App Script to craft my ideal expense-splitting tool. Here's what sets it apart:\n\n\ud83c\udf1f **Differentiating Features:**\n\n- \ud83d\udcbb **Web-based via Google Sheets:** Accessible on any device, anytime, without the need for a specific app.\n- \ud83d\ude80 **Batch Entry:** Enter all your transactions in one go, without a myriad of clicks for each.\n- \ud83d\udcca **Detailed Category by Person:** Perfect for YNAB users, allowing for accurate tracking with category-specific spending and owed amounts.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf89 **And, All the Favorites:**\n\n- \ud83d\udd04 **Uneven Splits by Transaction:** Flexibility to divide expenses in just the right way.\n- \ud83d\udca1 **Simplified Debts:** A beloved feature from Splitwise, ensuring the least amount of payments needed.\n- \ud83d\udcb8 **Suggested Reimbursements:** Smart suggestions for who owes what to whom.\n* \ud83e\udd1d **Share with Friends:** Easily invite friends to add their transactions, making group expense tracking a breeze.\n- \ud83c\udf0d **Multiple Currencies:** Enter transactions in multiple currencies and select your preferred settlement currency for seamless global expense management.\n- \ud83d\udd22 **Total Balances by Person:** Keep track of each person\u2019s financial involvement at a glance.\n- \ud83d\udeab **No Ads:** Enjoy an uninterrupted experience.\n- \ud83d\udcdd **No Registration Required:** (Google Authentication) - Start using it right away with your Google account.\n\n\n# \ud83d\udcd8 Comprehensive Guide\n\nNavigating through this tool is designed to be intuitive, with several tabs and functionalities to make expense tracking and splitting effortless. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of what each section does and how to use it:\n\n# 1. **Sheets Overview**\n**Transactions Tab**\n\n- **Expenses:** Enter up to 100 transactions here, including details like store name, category, amount, who paid, and whether it was split evenly.\n\n- **Names:** Add names across the top row. Use checkboxes to indicate who was involved in each transaction.\n> A ***checker column*** ensures that someone must be involved in the transaction if an amount paid by is filled out.\n> Additionally ***conditional formatting*** to highlight if a box is checked but no name is filled in at the top.\n\n- **Amounts Owed:** Calculates what each person owes per transaction. If a transaction wasn\u2019t split evenly, you can manually adjust amounts here. A checker column ensures the total matches the sum of all people involved.\n- **Balances:** Displays the total amount each participant paid, how much they owe, and any gap created for each person.\n- **Transactions:** Auto-calculates up to 8 transactions but allows for manual adjustments for reconciliation.\n- **Suggested Reimbursements:** After clicking the green run button in the top right, this section suggests optimized reimbursements between participants. It shows who owes who and how much, with a checkbox to mark payments as received.\n\n**Debts by Category Tab**\n\n- For those who are like me and have *never* been able to accurately input a YNAB split transaction with an entire group spending portfolio, **this tab is for you!** It allows you to see how much each person paid, owed, and their net spending per category. You can use this table as a guide for your YNAB transaction to show what you owe and are owed by category. This detail ensures that even if multiple payments are made or received, ***your YNAB split transactions accurately reflect your spending***.\n\n# 2. **How to Use This Tool:**\n\n1.

Running a sample situation with a modest state income tax and no progressivity to it, the extra income will face 22% + 7.65% + ~4% taxes, so 50k earns an extra ~33k (less in a high income tax state), which means if you spend 20k, you end up with an extra 13k/year to save.

I doubt I would, especially if it meant missing time with the kid.  and 20k doesn't go that far for services.  Yeah, you can get a cleaner, but planning and cooking meals?   Or doing the day to day pickup of things (especially with an 8yo, this is huge).  Might need a nanny or after school daycare.   That stuff will seriously add up.\n\nMy guess is that time to FI can be optimized a lot better by having husband be a frugality monster than getting a 50k job. Probably needs something closer to 100k to make that make more sense just from a financial standpoint.\n\nOTOH, if they'd get more out of working outside the home than doing what they are doing personally, that could make the difference."}, {"comment_text": "I actually took a substantial paycut from my previous job for my current because it is a lot less stress and better hours.

Are we on roughly the right track?", "reply_text": "A few things to consider:\n\n1. Since you're already feeling behind, I'd ask you to leave your low-interest debt alone and just make the regularly scheduled payments on both. Instead, invest the \"sudden debt relief money\" into a brokerage account tracking S&P500 index funds OR if you're very risk averse, some short-term CDs or HYSAs may have current returns >4.7%. That will most likely yield you more money in the long-term than the interest savings from paying down extra principal early. It also provides \"extra emergency fund buffer\" if you wind up suddenly jobless. You'll still retain the decision to pay off all remaining debts at once (when brokerage account reaches remaining debt amount), protect your family from downside risk of sudden joblessness, and could re-evaluate the decision with your actual compounding to date in that brokerage account in XX years data points.\n\n2. Do you have access to a mega-backdoor option, solo 401k, or some other method to get your 401k balance to your ~1 million target in 6-8 years? Otherwise, I assume the employee max contribution of ~22-23k/year may put a damper on that timeline. You may be referring to letting it grow to $1 million after stopping contributions after 6-8 years of maxing before you start withdrawing, but wasn't clear.\n\n3. I would be careful on the financial advisor front, do your research, and ask plenty of questions to make sure they will act in your best interest. Some can legally call themselves fiduciaries and still steer you into less than ideal investment products (with high annual fees that will eat your long-term returns & compounding) or riskier asset classes/mixes than needed to achieve your investment/retirement goals."}, {"comment_text": "Thank you for raising these questions\n1) that is an interesting strategy that I had not considered.

Shift your perspective from the mortgage burden/stress to making the wisest/best financial decision - translation the best total return in 6-8 years.  Since your interest rate is 4.7%, I would continue making the normal mortgage payments and invest a small portion of the extra cash into a low cost US total stock market index fund (When interest rates moderate later this year, the mid-caps & small-caps should rise considerably).  I would put aside another portion of the extra cash into a treasury bill (pay no State taxes) and/or into a CD, so you can have more peace of mind w/ a higher cash emergency fund.\n\n2.  I would try to tweak my budget month by month to see where I can decrease my spending/expenses.  Whether it's one less subscription, less dining out, meal prep more, buy groceries at a discount grocery store (Aldi), etc.  Just take small baby steps to make sustainable lifestyle changes. \n\n3.  I would max out my workplace 401k and if there is a mega back door option, I would take advantage of that.\n\n4.  Perhaps, your husband can start a small part-time job (Uber eats, DoorDash, etc.) to help out.\n\n5.  I would cut back on the 529 since your kid can always take out a loan if the 529 doesn't cover all the educational expenses.  I would focus on my retirement portfolio/plan first.  Similar to the oxygen mask in the airplane, where you put your mask on first, then your child.\n\n6.  If you can't handle the stress at work, consider negotiating a severance package (Read Financial Samurai).  For me, instead of quitting (early retirement), I was able to negotiate a severance package & collected unemployment!\n\n7.  Finally, 6-8 years seems like a long time, but it isn't... it goes by fast.  I would go hard, be like a maniac.  Put your foot on the gas pedal!\n\nBut you do you, good luck!\n\np.s. no need for a financial advisor, you can do this on your own!"}, {"comment_text": "I have been lurking this sub for a while now, and have learned a lot but still feel like I have a long way to go.

The Roth contribution limit is the lesser of the annual contribution limit or the 529 beneficiary's income for the year. The contribution limit starts phasing out when an individuals adjusted gross income is greater than $138,000 and is fully phased out after $153,000. For couples, the contribution is reduced starting at $218,000 and phased out altogether at $228,000.* ***However, under SECURE 2.0 this phase out is adjusted for the 529 rollover but may not permit a full contribution in all cases.*** *You should consult a tax advisor regarding your specific situation.*"}, {"comment_text": "Please use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new post to the sub.

I wouldn't have to pay rent. We're close friends and it's a kind and tempting offer.\n\nI am feeling torn. Living with him in Charlotte would save me $1,200-$1400 per month (the going rate of a bedroom in a house in Boston). But when I've visited Charlotte, I've never been especially drawn to it (both in terms of its physical structure and the vibe of the people living there) and he is the only person I know there too. I am trying to figure out what to do next when my sublease ends in May. What would you do? \\~$17,000 (a year's rent) is 20% of my gross income and would supercharge my savings, but I don't see myself in Charlotte long term.

Then, start saving for real estate investments. This delays the potentially higher yield investment.\n\n3) Make minimum $336/month payments on student loans and prioritize real estate investment savings of $1,464 per month and start investing in real estate or other higher yield assets sooner.

Would you say that picks up on some of the non-correlating aspects of bonds?", "reply_text": "Yes, it definitely does pick up on some of the non-correlating aspects of bonds, but that wasn't really what I was driving at.   Let me go into this in a bit more detail - I've been thinking of making a full post on this topic but maybe testing the waters with you to see if I can express myself well will be useful.\n\nLet's take a typical example:  55 year old is retiring at the end of this year with a portfolio of $2,500,000 and decides they want to use a classic 60/40 stock/bond mix, which conveniently is $1,500,000 in stocks (let's say VOO/VTI/VT depending on preference) and $1,000,000 in bonds.  The natural question that comes up next is: what bonds?\n\nMy point is that just picking something like VCSH (short term) or BND (intermediate term total market) or 30 year treasuries or 10 year treasuries is fine for a basic simulator but if you want to build something special, that approach misses out on what is super interesting about bonds, which is that you can build a ladder of specific maturities to match your cash flow needs and this gives a reasonable answer to the retiree for \"what bonds should I choose\"?\n\nI like TIPS for retirees because of their inflation-protection benefits.  Let's say our retiree expects $3000 a month. (in today's dollars) from social security and they plan to get there by holding off on taking benefits until age 70.  So here's an interesting approach for spending the $1,000,000 on bonds:\n\nhttps://www.tipsladder.com/build?incomeRequirementKind=Spy&firstYear=2025&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=60000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&income=24000&bondChoiceForGap=NearestBond&bondChoiceWithinYear=BestYield\n\nThis costs $996,915.  It means guaranteed income of $60k per year (inflation adjusted) for the next 30 years, and it takes into account the $36k of social security by decreasing the amount of bonds bought to cover later years.\n\nSo this retiree has achieved the original objective of a 60/40 portfolio but they have achieved something else as well: a specific guaranteed income for the next 30 years of $60k.  Now, a $2.5 million portfolio can sustain $100,000 a year for 30 years on the 4% rule, or $87,500 on a more conservative 3.5% rule.  So it isn't like the bond ladder is doing anything particularly magical here.  But it gives some certainty to a huge portion of the income.\n\nAlso, if you think \"Ok, so, $60k of base expenses is covered, but I'll need to draw $27,500 a year from the $1.5 million stock portfolio\" that's only 1.8% drawdown on the stock portion.  (In the happy event of living longer than 30 years, it's pretty clear that a $1.5 million stock portfolio which has been growing with only 1.8% drawdown is going to very likely be a lot bigger.)\n\nAgain, I'm not suggesting that my approach \"beats the market\" or does anything magical.  But I think by recognizing that bonds can be used to match specific cash flow needs is interesting, and no existing calculators do this well, as far as I know.\n\nOne final note: my approach implies a rising equity percentage over the years - the bonds are a \"set it and forget it\" income generator for 30 years, and at the end of the 30 years (if you didn't make any adjustments along the way) you'd be 100% in stocks.  I think there are some very good reasons to do that, which we could discuss at length if you're interested.   But the short version is: having a portion in bonds makes less sense the lower your needs relative to portfolio size.  If you imagine a frugal person who lives on $60k per year, and has a portfolio of $10 million, they obviously don't need bonds at all.  In all but the 5% worst-case scenarios in the \"4% rule\" approach, investors end up with more money in later years sometimes a lot more.  So a rising equity percentage, assuming things are going well, makes sense.  And then also as you get into older years, you should probably be managing your wealth for the benefit of later generations, who have a long time horizon. \n\nBut most of that is neither here nor there - it's just really a wishlist that I wanted to express to someone who is building a calculator. :)"}, {"comment_text": "I am building a FIRE calculator, and I want to include bonds to have the ability to diversify your portfolio.

As my home is paid off I didn't feel a need for a bond tent as I could flex my annual expenses downward by quite a bit if I chose to (if you're not needing to pull $25k-$45k a year out of your portfolio to pay a mortgage, your annual expenses naturally are much lower).  It also allowed me to have zero healthcare expenses the last few years because of my lower withdrawals as well.  This year I'm making a one time withdrawal for \\[specific event, all LTCG\\] so that bumps me up in the ACA tables to...$175 a month in healthcare expenses.  \n\nSo I didn't transition to 80/20 - I stayed at 80/20; I decided that in paying off my home I did not need a big hedge of bonds because my core expenses can be low.  \n\nAn example with simplified numbers: If Sam's annual expenses are $80k a year with nothing that can be cut without feeling constantly pinched?  Yes, that's going to hit the portfolio (and their stress levels!) differently in a down market than if Sam takes the $40k mortgage off the table and now only *needs* to withdraw $40k a year.  \n\nSay Sam retires and their annual spend is $80k a year.  In scenario A, Sam is paying a mortgage of $40k a year and with that $80k spending is exactly meeting their core needs and nothing more.  In scenario B, Sam is also spending $80k a year, but they are *not* paying a mortgage and they spend $40k meeting their core needs, *plus* spending $40k on traveling, ski passes, balloon animals, etc.  \n\nIn their third year of retirement the market crashes.  The Sam that *needs* $80k a year to keep the lights on is going to experience the stress of this in a different way than the Sam that *needs* $40k a year.  \n\nThe Sam without a mortgage may decide to ease up on their spending a bit and watch this play out, so they decide to go from spending $80k a year (where $40k a year of that was fun money), to $45k a year.  They still have $5k of fun money to spend, whereas Sam *with* the mortgage has none of the fun money, and is still withdrawing $80k a year during the crash and protracted bear market.\n\nNow, if Sam who needs $80k a year to meet their core expenses has a good bond tent?  They're probably stressed, but doing ok and are holding on.  This is what they planned for, and they traded the possibility of greater growth during most years for the safety net of their bond tent.\n\nThere is no cut and dry, right or wrong way to do this - it is *personal* finance.  As I had a higher mortgage rate, it didn't \"make sense\" for me to be paying an annual mortgage payment, which would then also require higher withdrawals from my portfolio...which would then require me to pay thousands in healthcare expenses...which would then bump me up into paying federal taxes every year.  \n\nIn day to day life - cash flow: I sweep dividends to cash out of my taxable brokerage accounts into checking, and if I need more than that I sell shares.  Because all of this is qualified income (a mix of long term cap gains and qualified dividends), I've yet to pay any federal taxes in RE, and I pay a small amount in state taxes."}, {"comment_text": "Please use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new post to the sub.

But if you do the math, it doesn't matter all that much at age 55.

The main impact I see is the process of buying and selling a house.

I was out of work on full short-term disability for several months around the time I was diagnosed. \n\nThe disability affects my FIRE planning in several ways. \n\n1) I view early retirement as a \"when\" not an \"if.\"  A lot of people dream about it but don't end up pulling the trigger until they're close to traditional retirement age, which I totally get, because one more year changes the math quite a bit.  But I am unlikely to have that option.  As a result, my asset allocation is a bit more conservative than it might otherwise be (I'm doing a inflation-indexed bond ladder with a portion of my fixed income to bridge me from age 50 to 70, since I don't imagine I'll be working full-time at 50).  \n\n2) This is US-specific, but I'm also going to try my best to stay eligible to apply for Social Security Disability Income (which requires that you've worked 5 of the last 10 years).  SSDI comes with the added benefit of Medicare after a two year waiting period, and I'm hoping that between that and the ACA I will be fine for health insurance.  Worth checking to see if you have similar requirements in your country.\n\n3) My condition complicates the \"do I keep trucking or coast\" analysis.  On the one hand, if I took it easier now, my health may improve.  On the other, maybe I should work as much as I can now in order to make money while I still can.  I am very conscious that most early retirees have the option/ability to go back to work, and that that's much less likely for me.\n\n4) I'm 40 now, and have been on the FIRE path since my early 20s.  My autoimmune issues cropped up in my mid-30s.  Having a chronic illness sucks, but I am so, so grateful that by the time it hit me, I was already basically FI.

I'm still at a big corporation, and I honestly can't wait to FIRE.\n\nCredit Karma says my net worth is 2.84M.\n\nMy plan is to FIRE in May 2025 based on some spreadsheet calculations and a talk with a financial adviser. I would like to get a second, third, etc. opinion on how realistic that is. I understand it is a calculation but it is major milestone and wanted to get some additional thoughts on what my financial adviser's recommendations were. My adviser said:\n\n>\"The goal is to have your brokerage sustain you until age 60 when you can start drawing down from your retirement accounts. You have $483k \\[at the time, now $559k\\] in retirement accounts. If we can assume a 7% return until age 60, that would give you $2.3M in retirement and give you $91k/year in income.\n\n>Right now you need to replace $65k/year in income so if we add inflation of 3%, you would need $128k/year in income. So, your retirement balance will get you to $91k/year and your income need will be $128k/year leaving you a gap of $37k/year to cover you income needs in retirement. This is where your rental property comes in to fill the gap.\n\n>Right now your rental provides $3,300/month and in 14 years the mortgage will be paid off. If we factor in inflation for rental prices, the average inflation rate for rentals over the last 100 years has been 2.7%. If we go with an even more conservative number of 2%, this would have your rental property generating $62k/year in income.\"\n\nBasically the adviser said I need to have at least 1.3M in brokerage accounts that will hold me over to when I'm done paying off my mortgage, when I will generate more income.\n\n**Current Total Comp with my Employer:**\n\n* Base Salary + Bonus: 205K\n* Estimated value of stock vesting in next 12 months: 100k\n\n***Assets***\n\nCash:\n\n* 100K in checking/savings accounts, which includes 85K in a HYSA (going to deposit some of that into my brokerage account soon).\n\n**Brokerage/Investments:**\n\n1.06M in Betterment (100% equities/0% bonds)\n\n* US Large Cap (SPLG: 515 shares, ITOT: 2689 shares, VTV: 300 shares, VTI: 193 shares, SPYV: 925 shares)\n* US Small Cap (VBR: 315 shares, IWN: 21 shares)\n* US Mid Cap (VOE: 437 shares, IWS: 70 shares)\n* INTL Emerging (VWO: 1451 shares, IEMG: 1630 shares)\n* INTL Developed (VEA: 4491 shares, SCHF: 913 shares, IEFA: 562 shares)\n\n103K in company stock (Tech, not sharing for anonymity)\n\nHSA: 3K (I know, this is super low, starting to invest into this)\n\nRobinhood: 1.7K (mostly for fun, some FAANG stocks)\n\nCrypto: 800 (again, mostly for fun)\n\n**Retirement Accounts:**\n\n492K in Fidelity\n\n* VANG INST 500 IDX (73.72%), VANG IS EXT MKT IDX (9.25%), CSCRX 14.13%), PEQSX (2.9%)\n\nROTH IRA\n\n* VTI (51.8K), VXUS (5.5K)\n\n**Property:**\n\n* Currently living rent-free with fiance (who owns the property), we just split utilities\n* I own a condo (built in 2013) with an annoying 430/month HOA\n   * 1.068M on Zillow\n   * 281K Principal Balance, Interest Rate: 2.375%, Maturity Date: 5/1/2036\n   * Currently renting it out, which pretty much breaks even when you factor property management costs, property tax of around 9k a year (broken up into two installments)\n   * I plan on not selling this house for as long as possible so I can get \"passive\" income\n\n**Estimated Yearly Expenses is 65K when I FIRE if you include:**\n\n* Insurance: Car, Health, Umbrella, Disability\n* Mortgage (done paying in 2037): 2231.27/month + property tax + HOA\n   * Note: I break even from my rental income (rent - management fees - property tax).\n* Various subscriptions and memberships, utilities, leisure\n\n**Other factors:**\n\n* My fiance and I do not plan on having children.\n* My fiance (2.5 years younger than I am) and I are getting married later this year (yes we have a pre-nup), and they plan on working at their corporate job for at least another 3 years, possibly longer before also FIRE'ing.
