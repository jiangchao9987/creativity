Product functions somewhat like a 5-year CD that can run for 30 years total.  Has a weird quirk that you can \"look-back\" on inflation, but this only applies in the first six months, which is not that good when the product has a 1 year requirement and 3-month interest penalty.\n\nThe quirk is why you bought them in the first place.  If you're not holding them for tax-deferred, inflation protection (HYSAs are not) or downside protection, the reason to hold them in i-bond format starts to fall out.\n\nRedeeming will trigger taxes in the year you do it, which is roughly \\~$1000 of ordinary income.  If you don't have an ideal tax year it's a lot simpler to analyze and just assume it's irrelevant since it will be the same.  So if you lose 3% interest over 3 months, 5% will make up for that in \\~4.5 months which is an assumption but not an unreasonable one.  It gets more complicated only if you can consider a low tax year to redeem them, which may favor letting the i-bond compound.  \n\n(What you can't predict to be clear - bond rates and how they affect HYSA or other products could be inferior to inflation and giving up the i-bond could be worse long term because you can't re-buy.  But this is where I'd argue format is more important.  Assume you can't predict this, would you rather have this money in I-bond format or in an HYSA?  And for most cases the HYSA is simply the better functional option than whether any shorter term difference in yield is worth it.)", "reply_created_utc": 1714498074.0}, {"index": "red1_s0_c5_", "comment_text": "Please use this thread to have discussions which you don't feel warrant a new post to the sub.

That's it.  That was enough to make all the sacrifice worthwhile.\n\nI have cerebral palsy.  I spent the first 7 years of my adult life living *well* below the poverty line.  I graduated during the great recession, and that time left me *riddled* with anxiety.  I really struggled with imposter syndrome.  I just knew it was a matter of time until I was laid off and could never work in the field again.  Given my disability, I couldn't do like most guys I knew and go work a trade.  I also couldn't go back on SSI with a college degree.  I literally used to calculate how long I could live out of my truck, because that seemed like a very real possibility.\n\nSo I worked my *ass* off.  I worked crazy hours, and then came home and studied datastructures, algorithms and design patterns to make myself a better dev.  I was used to living lean on disability, so while I inflated my spending a little (groceries and books!) I saved most of my salary cause I figured any day now the jig would be up.\n\nEventually, the money started accumulating so I started investing it.  Life went on this way, with little milestones until my mid 30's when I *finally* crossed the FI threshold.  I had been working towards this for a decade, but oddly, it wasn't any big event for me.  There is just this subtle feeling of contentment and gratitude.  It took a while for it to sink in that I was genuinely 'safe'.\n\nIt's been about 5 years since then, and each time I go in to update my little program, I get a little 'zap' of happiness.  I've moved beyond being able to afford my basic needs to pretty much all my 'wants' as well.

I think costs can range a lot but gear, travel, uniforms, etc add up. My kid does debate which requires some overnight travel (hotels, flights) to tournaments and dues to pay for coaching. Super worth it but this special interest costs a couple thousand per year. \n\nTests and college applications: PSAT, SAT, AP exams charge fees to take those tests, every college you apply to costs a little over $100. I\u2019ve gone through the college application process with one kid and she applied to 8 universities (that\u2019s normal: a few stretch schools, a few target schools and a few back up schools) so that cost $900. \n\nMy kids didn\u2019t have tutoring, but some students benefit from that and it would be another expense. \n\nNon-family travel: they might go on cool ass high school field trips. My kid\u2019s high school orchestra traveled to NYC to perform there\u2014that trip fee was $1500. My other daughter went on a class camping trip that cost $500 per student. Ive even heard about class trips to other countries! This sounds outrageous but they love it so much to have these novel experiences with their friends/classmates in a safe way, huge bonding time. \n\nTechnology: my city teens move around independently on public transportation, bike and on foot. They are gone all day. Gotta have smart phones. I got them refurbished iPhones that are 3 models old \u2014cost approx $400 per phone. Those last 2.5-3 years with heavy use and abuse. I got one of my kids a Switch video game console for her birthday a few years ago during the pandemic\u2014that cost $600. And junior high and older kids absolutely need a computer for homework. The teachers assign stuff via online portal and they all have to type papers and make google slide decks. I bought my older kid her own laptop when she was a sophomore in high school (she\u2019s now in college), my younger is still using my old laptop from 2015 but I\u2019m getting her a laptop for her senior year to get her through the college app process and she\u2019ll take it to college. \n\nTherapy: one of my kids needed specialized mental health support during high school. That was costly. My out of pocket was $800/month for 18 months. Necessary and worth it but not anticipated\u2014it was a surprise expense because of the pandemic.\n\nTeeth: both my kids had orthodontic braces ($5000 per kid after insurance coverage in my area), and wisdom teeth removed ($750 per kid, I think)", "comment_created_utc": 1714452119.0, "reply_text": "Thank you for this detailed reply.

It's me!\n\n..well, not exactly. BUT this really resonates with me. I'm quite a bit behind you in terms of NW (around $350k for my wife and I between individual investment account and retirement accounts). Not doing the kid thing, just us. Around 40 years old. Currently doing fulltime vanlife, but planning on buying something in the next yera / househacking for a subsidized property (hopefully free, if not generating a tiny bit of income from rent). $200k total W2 income, and maybe $10k **reportable** income per year from a side hustle.\n\nLately I'm just.. checked out, you know? Like I'm doing good at work, but I'm only putting in around 10 hours/week of REAL effort, plus another 10h / week of meetings. I could probably do a bit more, but it's easier to delegate to the guys who report to me. But I can't bring myself to CARE enough to do more, esp. since my company just refused to do any annual comp increases for people who gets profit share bonuses.\n\nOur FIRE number is $1.5m, *maybe* $1.25m depending on where we land with a househack situation. Our CoastFIRE number is around $800k. At this rate of savings (maxing out tax advantageous accounts, plus around $2500 to $3500/mo into VTI) we should be able to hit the $1.25m number in around 5 to 8 years, depending on how aggressive we are with savings - [see chart here](https://engaging-data.com/fire-calculator/?age=38&initsav=350000&spend=40000&initinc=160000&wr=4&ir=1&retspend=45750&stockpct=90&fixpct=8&cashpct=2&graph=fix&secgraph=0&stockrtn=8.1&bondrtn=2.4&MCstockrtn=0.081&MCbondrtn=0.024&tax=7&income=&incstart=50&incend=70&expense=0&expstart=50&expend=70).

{"post_title": "4 months into early retirement. A story of my journey so far...", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1cgbyi6/4_months_into_early_retirement_a_story_of_my/", "created_utc": 1714428344.0, "text": "**Background:** You can find a detailed background of my story [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/18n6wcs/fired_after_26_years_i_resigned_today/).  In brief it tells the story of how I got to $6m net worth and retired at 45years old.  Below is my latest update 4 months into retirement.\n\n**Portfolio performance:** Net worth over the last 90 days since my last update has increased from $6,453,452 to $6,596,541 that's an increase of about $140,000 in three months or about $45,000 per month on average.  The mix is made up from low cost broad based index funds and some real estate.\n\n**Real Estate:** I was not looking, but my mentor is retiring and getting rid of a few properties.  I was able to acquire one from them at a \\~15% discount.  I had to make some concessions and accommodate them for the good deal, as an experienced investor I was able to close in 10 days, no inspection contingency and acquired the property as is.  Not only that, but I got a loan which I will pay off in 12\u201318 months.  By getting the loan, I can keep my MAGI low, while also not having to touch the stock portfolio.  The loan is around 2% of net worth, even at 8% interest this is immaterial as I can pay it off quickly.  As a business loan, the interest is also fully tax-deductible.\n\n**Mentoring Impact:** As part of this process, I was also able to help one of my mentees acquire a property which was off market at a very reasonable price.  They are now in the throes of improving it.  They seem to be having so much fun bringing it back to life.  It's amazing to watch the progress, their triumphs and challenges.  Their mistakes and hard won lessons learned.  They remind me of my early days in real estate and in investing in general.  If they carry the same momentum, this young man and his partner, will likely retire 10 years before I was able to with much less stress than what I went through.\n\n**Personal Spending** has been in accordance with my estimates, with the exception, of the loan for the property acquisition.  Average monthly spending for the past 4 months has been around $4000 per month and about $16,000 in 4 months.  Its mainly comprising travel $8500, food $2200, medical $1200, gas $450, utilities $650, electronics $800, discretionary $500, reserve $1200, others $500.  Our food costs are super low as we enjoy our home cooking way more than any restaurant food.  I'm projecting personal spending of between 60,000 and 75,000 this year.  That amount is about $10,000 less than the worst-case scenario of $85,000.  $85K would be a withdrawal rate of 1.3%.

In brief it tells the story of how I got to $6m net worth and retired at 45years old.  Below is my latest update 4 months into retirement.\n\n**Portfolio performance:** Net worth over the last 90 days since my last update has increased from $6,453,452 to $6,596,541 that's an increase of about $140,000 in three months or about $45,000 per month on average.  The mix is made up from low cost broad based index funds and some real estate.\n\n**Real Estate:** I was not looking, but my mentor is retiring and getting rid of a few properties.  I was able to acquire one from them at a \\~15% discount.  I had to make some concessions and accommodate them for the good deal, as an experienced investor I was able to close in 10 days, no inspection contingency and acquired the property as is.  Not only that, but I got a loan which I will pay off in 12\u201318 months.  By getting the loan, I can keep my MAGI low, while also not having to touch the stock portfolio.  The loan is around 2% of net worth, even at 8% interest this is immaterial as I can pay it off quickly.  As a business loan, the interest is also fully tax-deductible.\n\n**Mentoring Impact:** As part of this process, I was also able to help one of my mentees acquire a property which was off market at a very reasonable price.  They are now in the throes of improving it.  They seem to be having so much fun bringing it back to life.  It's amazing to watch the progress, their triumphs and challenges.  Their mistakes and hard won lessons learned.  They remind me of my early days in real estate and in investing in general.  If they carry the same momentum, this young man and his partner, will likely retire 10 years before I was able to with much less stress than what I went through.\n\n**Personal Spending** has been in accordance with my estimates, with the exception, of the loan for the property acquisition.  Average monthly spending for the past 4 months has been around $4000 per month and about $16,000 in 4 months.  Its mainly comprising travel $8500, food $2200, medical $1200, gas $450, utilities $650, electronics $800, discretionary $500, reserve $1200, others $500.  Our food costs are super low as we enjoy our home cooking way more than any restaurant food.  I'm projecting personal spending of between 60,000 and 75,000 this year.  That amount is about $10,000 less than the worst-case scenario of $85,000.  $85K would be a withdrawal rate of 1.3%.  Most of the budget is discretionary and based on suggestions from many, I have been learning to increase spending within reason as I have always been naturally frugal.  \n\n**Health and fun:**  Working on losing weight slowly over time.  Started at 195lbs.  Currently, after about 9 weeks, I have lost about 12 pounds.  I have been exercising every day by running between 1.5 and 4 miles on the treadmill every day.  I'm averaging about 18,000 steps per day sometimes more.  I'm also planning to bike 1000 miles this year.  So far I have biked about 265 miles, mainly on the beach, around the local neighborhood and occasionally in a few nearby state parks and forests. I've also been learning how to build and fly drones.  It has been super fun and gets me outside.\n\n**Highlights:**  Losing 12 pounds!  It has been an effort eating better food, more sleep, more exercise but it has been worth it and a rewarding experience. Not missing the corporate job at all.  As an introvert, I find I'm also not missing the people either.  Busier than ever doing all the things in my bucket list and little projects.  Doing a lot of programming work and improving my garden.  So far I have avocadoes, peaches, oranges, grapes, loquats, and other fruit trees planted.\n\n**Surprises**\n\n1.

In brief it tells the story of how I got to $6m net worth and retired at 45years old.  Below is my latest update 4 months into retirement.\n\n**Portfolio performance:** Net worth over the last 90 days since my last update has increased from $6,453,452 to $6,596,541 that's an increase of about $140,000 in three months or about $45,000 per month on average.  The mix is made up from low cost broad based index funds and some real estate.\n\n**Real Estate:** I was not looking, but my mentor is retiring and getting rid of a few properties.  I was able to acquire one from them at a \\~15% discount.  I had to make some concessions and accommodate them for the good deal, as an experienced investor I was able to close in 10 days, no inspection contingency and acquired the property as is.  Not only that, but I got a loan which I will pay off in 12\u201318 months.  By getting the loan, I can keep my MAGI low, while also not having to touch the stock portfolio.  The loan is around 2% of net worth, even at 8% interest this is immaterial as I can pay it off quickly.  As a business loan, the interest is also fully tax-deductible.\n\n**Mentoring Impact:** As part of this process, I was also able to help one of my mentees acquire a property which was off market at a very reasonable price.  They are now in the throes of improving it.  They seem to be having so much fun bringing it back to life.  It's amazing to watch the progress, their triumphs and challenges.  Their mistakes and hard won lessons learned.  They remind me of my early days in real estate and in investing in general.  If they carry the same momentum, this young man and his partner, will likely retire 10 years before I was able to with much less stress than what I went through.\n\n**Personal Spending** has been in accordance with my estimates, with the exception, of the loan for the property acquisition.  Average monthly spending for the past 4 months has been around $4000 per month and about $16,000 in 4 months.  Its mainly comprising travel $8500, food $2200, medical $1200, gas $450, utilities $650, electronics $800, discretionary $500, reserve $1200, others $500.  Our food costs are super low as we enjoy our home cooking way more than any restaurant food.  I'm projecting personal spending of between 60,000 and 75,000 this year.  That amount is about $10,000 less than the worst-case scenario of $85,000.  $85K would be a withdrawal rate of 1.3%.  Most of the budget is discretionary and based on suggestions from many, I have been learning to increase spending within reason as I have always been naturally frugal.  \n\n**Health and fun:**  Working on losing weight slowly over time.  Started at 195lbs.  Currently, after about 9 weeks, I have lost about 12 pounds.  I have been exercising every day by running between 1.5 and 4 miles on the treadmill every day.  I'm averaging about 18,000 steps per day sometimes more.  I'm also planning to bike 1000 miles this year.  So far I have biked about 265 miles, mainly on the beach, around the local neighborhood and occasionally in a few nearby state parks and forests. I've also been learning how to build and fly drones.  It has been super fun and gets me outside.\n\n**Highlights:**  Losing 12 pounds!  It has been an effort eating better food, more sleep, more exercise but it has been worth it and a rewarding experience. Not missing the corporate job at all.  As an introvert, I find I'm also not missing the people either.  Busier than ever doing all the things in my bucket list and little projects.  Doing a lot of programming work and improving my garden.  So far I have avocadoes, peaches, oranges, grapes, loquats, and other fruit trees planted.\n\n**Surprises**\n\n1.

I'm averaging about 18,000 steps per day sometimes more.  I'm also planning to bike 1000 miles this year.  So far I have biked about 265 miles, mainly on the beach, around the local neighborhood and occasionally in a few nearby state parks and forests. I've also been learning how to build and fly drones.  It has been super fun and gets me outside.\n\n**Highlights:**  Losing 12 pounds!  It has been an effort eating better food, more sleep, more exercise but it has been worth it and a rewarding experience. Not missing the corporate job at all.  As an introvert, I find I'm also not missing the people either.  Busier than ever doing all the things in my bucket list and little projects.  Doing a lot of programming work and improving my garden.  So far I have avocadoes, peaches, oranges, grapes, loquats, and other fruit trees planted.\n\n**Surprises**\n\n1.

I hope to interact and continue working with my mentees, I learn so much from them.  I have been working on some coding projects using microcomputer boards and doing many automation projects.

In brief it tells the story of how I got to $6m net worth and retired at 45years old.  Below is my latest update 4 months into retirement.\n\n**Portfolio performance:** Net worth over the last 90 days since my last update has increased from $6,453,452 to $6,596,541 that's an increase of about $140,000 in three months or about $45,000 per month on average.  The mix is made up from low cost broad based index funds and some real estate.\n\n**Real Estate:** I was not looking, but my mentor is retiring and getting rid of a few properties.  I was able to acquire one from them at a \\~15% discount.  I had to make some concessions and accommodate them for the good deal, as an experienced investor I was able to close in 10 days, no inspection contingency and acquired the property as is.  Not only that, but I got a loan which I will pay off in 12\u201318 months.  By getting the loan, I can keep my MAGI low, while also not having to touch the stock portfolio.  The loan is around 2% of net worth, even at 8% interest this is immaterial as I can pay it off quickly.  As a business loan, the interest is also fully tax-deductible.\n\n**Mentoring Impact:** As part of this process, I was also able to help one of my mentees acquire a property which was off market at a very reasonable price.  They are now in the throes of improving it.  They seem to be having so much fun bringing it back to life.  It's amazing to watch the progress, their triumphs and challenges.  Their mistakes and hard won lessons learned.  They remind me of my early days in real estate and in investing in general.  If they carry the same momentum, this young man and his partner, will likely retire 10 years before I was able to with much less stress than what I went through.\n\n**Personal Spending** has been in accordance with my estimates, with the exception, of the loan for the property acquisition.  Average monthly spending for the past 4 months has been around $4000 per month and about $16,000 in 4 months.  Its mainly comprising travel $8500, food $2200, medical $1200, gas $450, utilities $650, electronics $800, discretionary $500, reserve $1200, others $500.  Our food costs are super low as we enjoy our home cooking way more than any restaurant food.  I'm projecting personal spending of between 60,000 and 75,000 this year.  That amount is about $10,000 less than the worst-case scenario of $85,000.  $85K would be a withdrawal rate of 1.3%.

If they carry the same momentum, this young man and his partner, will likely retire 10 years before I was able to with much less stress than what I went through.\n\n**Personal Spending** has been in accordance with my estimates, with the exception, of the loan for the property acquisition.  Average monthly spending for the past 4 months has been around $4000 per month and about $16,000 in 4 months.  Its mainly comprising travel $8500, food $2200, medical $1200, gas $450, utilities $650, electronics $800, discretionary $500, reserve $1200, others $500.  Our food costs are super low as we enjoy our home cooking way more than any restaurant food.  I'm projecting personal spending of between 60,000 and 75,000 this year.  That amount is about $10,000 less than the worst-case scenario of $85,000.  $85K would be a withdrawal rate of 1.3%.  Most of the budget is discretionary and based on suggestions from many, I have been learning to increase spending within reason as I have always been naturally frugal.  \n\n**Health and fun:**  Working on losing weight slowly over time.  Started at 195lbs.  Currently, after about 9 weeks, I have lost about 12 pounds.  I have been exercising every day by running between 1.5 and 4 miles on the treadmill every day.  I'm averaging about 18,000 steps per day sometimes more.  I'm also planning to bike 1000 miles this year.  So far I have biked about 265 miles, mainly on the beach, around the local neighborhood and occasionally in a few nearby state parks and forests. I've also been learning how to build and fly drones.  It has been super fun and gets me outside.\n\n**Highlights:**  Losing 12 pounds!  It has been an effort eating better food, more sleep, more exercise but it has been worth it and a rewarding experience. Not missing the corporate job at all.  As an introvert, I find I'm also not missing the people either.  Busier than ever doing all the things in my bucket list and little projects.  Doing a lot of programming work and improving my garden.  So far I have avocadoes, peaches, oranges, grapes, loquats, and other fruit trees planted.\n\n**Surprises**\n\n1. I did not expect I'd enjoy exercising as much as I do.  In January this year, when I retired, I weighed about 195 pounds and today I'm about 183. \n2. I realize I need to slow down so I don't hurt myself with all the DIY projects.  It would be a shame to have all this time and have to spend most of it recovering from injuries.\n3. I thought I really would miss work and the people there, but to be very honest, I miss neither.  I wish them well, though.\n\n**What's coming up:**  A big international trip (We have planned a trip of around 20,000 miles with the family over the summer to spend lots of quality time but also to just relax.).  Will also do some volunteer work overseas. Looking forward to helping, remaining humble and perhaps learning new skills.  I hope to interact and continue working with my mentees, I learn so much from them.  I have been working on some coding projects using microcomputer boards and doing many automation projects.  What an intellectual challenge but so thrilling when I get things working.  My life is fast becoming less about focusing on the FIRE goal and more delving into that pursuit of joy and mindfulness.\n\n**Final Reflections:  Luck plays a big role** in everything, but it does not replace self-discipline, delayed gratification, continuous learning, growing and helping enough people resolve their problems so they can help you resolve your own.  Hoping to do another update in a month or so. It is going to take time to settle into the new routine, but I have been amazed by how time has flown by.  I am thankful every day for the opportunity I was able to achieve in order to escape the matrix. Read bits of a book about principles and in summary it had some lessons which really resonated for me.  It seems they are universal lessons to live by, before and after FIRE.  The summary of it revolved around learning to:\n\n1. Not worry about looking good.  Worry about reaching your goal.\n2. Realizing you do not know everything, but there is so much information and resources that can help you make better radical decisions.\n3. Self-introspection, empathy and humility are key principles to a successful radically different life.\n\nLike Jim Rohn used to say:  **\"Don't be a follower.  Be a student.\"**  Students learn, then make up their own minds.  Looking forward to updating you guys in a few weeks or a few months' time as time is flying by!  I'm not selling anything.  Just happy to engage with the community so we can continue to learn together.  **AMA.**", "comment_created_utc": 1714428344.0, "reply_text": "The whole mentor-mentee thing is just one of those real estate MLMs. Sad.", "reply_created_utc": 1714483275.0}, {"index": "red1_s5_c14_r0_", "comment_text": "The whole mentor-mentee thing is just one of those real estate MLMs. Sad.", "comment_created_utc": 1714483275.0, "reply_text": "[deleted]", "reply_created_utc": 1714484794.0}, {"index": "red1_s5_c14_r0_r0_", "comment_text": "[deleted]", "comment_created_utc": 1714484794.0, "reply_text": "I\u2019m familiar with these \u201csystems.\u201d I\u2019m glad you feel good about yourself, investing in real estate that helps to continue subjugating poorer people.

When I started studying I kept having this temporary part time jobs to have some money for me and I wasn't taking any money from my parents for clothing, food, going out, education expenditures etc, but I was also living rent free and didn't pay bills for electricity and water, which helped a lot... At first I saved 2/3 of earnings, then I was living off savings for quite a long time, but managed to keep fluidity and solid safety cash pillow.\n\nThen (before I finished education, but after I got my permanent contract in desired field - still on part time) I moved to my BF also rent free - he proposed it, he was renting a small room in shared apartment at that time. \nAfter a year of living together, several raises on my part and switching to full time, we found very nice, 1-bedroom 45m2 apartament almost outside the city with cheap rent - probably because it wasn't fully furnished, which wasn't problem at all. At that time I earned ~6000 PLN/month, rent was 1500 PLN/month which splitted equally was 12.5% of my income, so I was able to save half.\n\nIn the same time I bought apartament on early construction stage - it was cheaper due to that + I have time to save more money and take lower mortage... We moved there after around 1.5 year, taking starter furniture with us. Cost of livings raised, but at that time I was also already earning more and was still able to save the half, especially with low mortage installment which was later even lower, because after COVID I got scared and change mortgage period from initial 10 years to 30 years to have low installment in case od financial problems - but I'm still making huge overpayments (half of my income) which I count as investments/saving, because I don't need this money for living. \n\nI'm over 30 now and still to this day I don't own my own car, which saves me a lot of money - I live in a big city, I'm working mostly remotely, when I go out I'm using bike, taxi or public transport.\nHowever I'm a co owner of my BF car - when he was upgrading I doubled his budget but I'm not participating in any maintenance cost. We are using it for visiting family outside of town, shopping and vacations.\n\nFrom couple years we are owning a 2 cats and they are stretch on a budget, but they are definately worth it \ud83d\ude0d\n\nI'm earning enough to live comfortably from other half - I'm even hiring cleaning services ~2x monthly, paying for PT which is quite expensive so I almost don't need to worry for money currently (however I'm still budgeting it - if I wouldn't keep eye on it it would be very easy to overspend)\n\nSo except following the rules you can see in my story also being very priviledged and lucky - so don't be harsh for yourself if you can't repeat this results, sometimes it's just not possible", "reply_created_utc": 1714375372.0}, {"index": "red1_s10_c68_", "comment_text": "As the title says I am just impressed with how today people can save that much.

I also had a career where I was able to increase my income significantly over time, which let me save very aggressively early on. Here are some examples of the frugality:\n\n* I did not own a car from 2008 \u2013 2016. I used public transit in a big city and took cabs.  This is huge. Cars are a HUGE cost. Now that I do have a car, the car is my number one source of random $1000 bills.\n* When I did buy a car I paid cash and got the cheapest decent used car I could find.\n* I lived with roommates or in the cheapest 1 br apartments I could find from 2008 - 2017. This let me crank my savings rate up very high because housing is typically the largest living cost. At one point i was spending only 5% of my net income on rent!\n* Avoid any unnecessary bills. Spotify, Netflx, Amazon Prime, etc. They do add up when you have a bunch of them.\n* I just never bought nice stuff when I was younger. People in their 20s always feel pressure to buy a nice car, a nice watch, fancy $1000 iPhone, etc. I never did any of that. I have had basic stuff for most of my adult life. \n* Don't \"go shopping\", be strategic with your purchases \n* Pick hobbies that save you money or are very cheap. I learned how to cook and made that one of my hobbies. I play kickball in the park in a free group. \n* I don't go out to bars or drink much.

Any tips or advice?", "comment_created_utc": 1714321618.0, "reply_text": "The answer is fairly simple (if not easy):  Make a lot of money, but spend like people who don't.  \n\nAlso bear in mind that standard usage of savings rate in this community is post tax, but some people don't calculate it that way.  If you're calculating pre-tax, it's almost impossible to get to 70%+, since at high incomes you're typically paying 20-30% of your income in taxes alone.   If you have a 30-35% pre-tax savings rate, that could easily be 50% *post tax*.\n\nSo that might be the issue.   The other issue might be that you make a relatively normal/average income and not a very high one. \n\nIt's a whole lot easier to save 50-70% when you make a top decile income than if you make something like 70-80k.   Saving 50-60% when you make 150-200k is living like a \"normal person\" who makes a comfortable middle class wage. Saving 50-60% when you make 75k (still a well above average income for one person) is living like somebody who just barely makes a living wage.   Saving 50% on a median wage is living like somebody who isn't far above the poverty level (with the caveat that life for someone who makes 40-50k and has \"near poverty level\" spending is a lot more comfortable and secure than most people who only make just enough above to poverty level to not get various welfare benefits like SNAP and Medicaid).\n\nSo advice is going to depend a lot on your situation.  If you make a very high income in anything but the highest cost areas, the answer is to figure out some stuff you've been buying that you don't really need, because there's plenty of it.\n\nIf you make a lower income, the answer may be to aggressively pursue more income if that's realistic.  Or it might be to satisfy yourself with a lower savings rate and longer FI timeline (30-35% still means you can retire very early if you aren't already approaching middle age when you start).", "reply_created_utc": 1714484852.0}, {"index": "red1_s10_c127_", "comment_text": "As the title says I am just impressed with how today people can save that much.

I'm not as cute and personable as she is so not sure my tips would be as good, but I am definitely considering following her lead in that regard. I also am going to try to monetize some passion projects but that will take some time to get rolling (and may not roll at all haha).\n\nThe 4% rule was calculated for a 30 year retirement and not counting SS benefits, I think. Really thinking about that is what inspired me to start considering FIRE at all. Realizing I average about 90k year, and SS will pay 42k at 67 years old, which would mean, at that time (in today's dollars) I would only need a 2.8% withdrawal rate. That was literally the aha moment for me, realizing I may be closer than I think factoring in my SPIA and with the hope/assumption that SS will remain there for my time frame (honestly it would political suicide for our politicians to let SS degrade to the point where benefits would slash so I feel as if they will figure something out).

I updated the OP to include my taxable/tax-deferred is split -I do have some flexibility there (30% is in taxable). I think I will focus on building a big cash buffer in taxable in my remaining time at work. I also updated the OP to include that I am a single filer, so don't benefit from the expanded brackets you married folks do :).

Given my living situation and the level of discretionary spending, I definitely have some flexibility in the budget.\n* I didn't realize FICA tax is not taken out of 401k withdrawals, so looks like any 401k distributions will have a sub-14% effective tax rate) (no income tax state)\n* KFF health insurance marketplace estimator is putting me in a silver plan for $7650/year (based on my input of 90k income).

It occurred to me that if I work until I have 3m, come retirement age and social security, I\u2019ll have way more than enough, or, stated another way, I\u2019d have worked many more years than I had to, which would be a shame because I really dislike my job and am so ready to move on.\n\nIf I punch the numbers into [firecalc.app](http://firecalc.app), it gives me a \\~95% success rate. If I add a part time job (earning 21k/year), it gives me 100% success rate.\n\nThe thing that seems unusual is that my withdrawal rate would be higher, early in FI, and lower once social security fits in.

I have been using the Rich Broke or Dead calculator for some simple case studies as it allows you to add in income at certain points.  My takeaway is that with SSI benefits included, the 4% rule can be stretched to the 4.5% rule.  Basically, you can withdraw 4.5% early in retirement (in your 50s) which is then offset by reduced withdrawals later in life due to aging (less travel, etc) and SSI benefits.  I've even heard some say 5%, but that might depend on just how much SSI will cover of your annual spend.  The more it will cover, the larger % you can withdraw earlier.  For my calcs, SSI would cover 40% of my expenses at 65.  But if you could live 100% off of SSI, then you could hypothetically withdraw all of your retirement savings between 55 and 62-70 and live on SSI thereafter...not recommended though!\n\nEDIT:  I see you used Rich Broke or Dead as well.

Most of the stuff they eat is homemade, so it's a much healthier standard American diet than most folks eat.  They'll figure out what works best for them as adults.  Our teenage daughter has elected to join us in keto/carnivore land for the last two months and is really enjoying it.\n\nMy wife and I fluctuate between carnivore and keto depending on what happens to appeal at any given time.  I'd say we're baseline carnivore, but we go through seasonal waves of eating lots of salads and soups heavy with veg.\n\nWe make effectively all of our food from scratch, so for the most part we're talking extremely clean keto/carnivore.\n\nWe're also mostly OMAD, with lunch being the only meal we typically eat.\n\nWe didn't have any particular philosophical reason for doing this, but rather simply observed what food actually did to us.  Ultra-processed foods made us feel terrible, do we killed those.  Processed carbs act almost like a drug on us, leading to highs/lows/addiction/withdrawal, so we dramatically cut those back to special occasions.  Fewer unprocessed carbs led to more energy and general well-being, so we cut those down to intermittent non-starchy veg and low-carb fruit (berries, mostly).  What's left is keto/carnivore, which just happens to be what makes us feel our best.  Fantastic for all of our medical markers too.  We're in the best shape of our lives having been mostly carnivore for many years now.\n\nThe OMAD bit came about mostly by itself.  Turns out our bodies didn't actually need anywhere near the amount of food we were eating back when we were eating carbs and ultra-processed garbage.  One meal a day is usually plenty of food for us and enough to keep us satisfied all day, but we're not dogmatic about it.  It's pretty much just eat when you're hungry, just like drinking water whenever you're thirsty.  Body wants something, give it something.\n\nI also do week-long water fasts 3-4 times a year, mostly as a mental fitness routine.  I find it beneficial to remind myself periodically that I am theoretically in charge of my body, plus it feels really good to run entirely off of reserves sometimes.\n\nWe also periodically throw all the rules away and spend a week drinking crap, eating ice cream and pastries, and going out for  carby/processed commercial food.

I can make my own bread, cook lentils, beans, rice, and make my own soups and such.

I have this every day. Cutting out sugary breakfasts has helped me with avoiding hunger later in the day.\n\nSnack is Greek Yogurt.  I look for no sugar added.  Greek yogurt has a good amount of protein, but a lot of brands are sugar bombs.  Oikos triple zero is my preferred, but I'll get what's on sale among the sugar-free.  I eat about 2-3 quarts per week.  I've counted macros (fat, carbs, proteins) a few times and found that Greek yogurt (low fat, low carb, high protein) is really helpful at making my eating habits hit the numbers I want it to.  Cottage cheese or a protein shake would do similar, but I find the yogurt tastier.\n\nI get about 4 salad kits per week that I split with my wife.

The idea that someone can have the willpower to cook a healthy dinner after a long day of work, potentially dealing with kids, is just not realisitic long-term. Make good choices early in the day while your willpower is high, and allow yourself some grace at nighttime. This is also aided by the fact that I work from home, so I can go to the kitchen and not be locked into whatever I packed for myself.\n\nNormal breakfast -> Banana + protein powder shake\n\nThen I go lift weights, and when I come home I eat -> 2 hard boiled eggs, plain 0% fat greek yogurt with whatever fruit is in season, another protein shake\n\nFor lunch I try to make sure to eat at least 1 big serving of vegetables. Most of the time either carrots, bell pepper, or cucumber with hummus. And then I either make a quesadilla (filled with black beans + bell pepper in addition to cheese) or a sandwich with deli meat, cheese, avocado if I have it, lettuce. Sometimes also tortilla chips and salsa. Or leftovers from a previous dinner. Whatever staple item (sandwich, etc.) you decide to do for most of your lunches, try to make it as healthy as possible. Eating the same thing over and over prevents you from buying 12 different fresh vegetables and then half of them rot before you can eat them all. Just buy/eat the same thing over and over until you're sick of it, then change it up a bit.\n\nDinner is highly variable, but again, I've \"put in the work\" earlier in the day and I feel I have more leeway to be unhealthy or just not think about it too hard. As others have said though, I do very very little stuff like frozen pizza, pre-made dinners, packaged food. Have a list of like 10-14 recipes you can do that are easy like spaghetti with meat sauce, grilled salmon and rice, etc. Or, 3-4 days a week, totally fine to just eat a hamburger with fries or similar \"quick\" food. \n\nNot sure how helpful or instructive any of that is for applying it to your own life. I grew up in a very \"meat and potatoes\" family with tons of butter on everything and not a lot of vegetables that didn't come out of a can. It can be hard to break out of that cycle, and I can't put my finger on exactly what switched inside me that I was able to get out of that rut after I left home.", "reply_created_utc": 1714340975.0}, {"index": "red1_s14_c50_", "comment_text": "So strange question.

Another favorite snack is unsweetened applesauce and a handful of walnuts.\n\nOranges and bananas for fruit. Blueberries only in season when they are cheaper. Avocado if reasonably priced. I like cabbage and will munch on a big wedge of it, raw, while browsing at the computer.\n\nSalmon, patted with avocado oil (because of its high smoke point) and done in the air fryer. Frozen turkey burger patties. Hamburger patties. Chicken bone-in thighs or leg quarters. Sardines in water. Brown rice with two over-medium fried eggs on top. Baked potato with liberal olive oil and salt.\n\nWhen I'm willing to go to a little more trouble with the cooking: homemade chicken soup; turkey enchiladas; loaded nachos; sloppy joe meat & a can mix (brand name Manwich) eaten with a fork.\n\nI always have something sweet every few days at least. Jelly beans are a candy I like but won't overeat. Cookies, or a Reese's pb cup. If ambitious I will make a yellow sheet cake or a pineapple upside-down cake and freeze it in portions. I drink instant coffee.\n\nI'm leanFIRE so my grocery budget needs to stay around $300 a month. I save all receipts and go through them item by item asking if it was a good value. If anything ended up being wasted I think about why, then take steps to either buy less or eat it sooner. \n\nHope this helps.", "reply_created_utc": 1714442510.0}, {"index": "red1_s14_c61_", "comment_text": "So strange question.

Do a budget, figure out every little thing. Maybe she can't live where she is currently. Fine. Bet you can find a way for her to make ends meet somewhere with a lower COL.

Thank you in advance for any assistance or guidance you can provide.  First, what I would like to accomplish; second, my current life and financial situation; and third, my questions:\n\n**What I Want to Accomplish**\n\nI want to \"soft retire\" by 55.  I'm currently 40.  Upon retirement, I want to cut my work hours to 20 or so per week, and spend a good deal of time traveling.\n\n**My Current Life & Financial Situation**\n\nI'm married, my wife and I are both 40, and we have no children.  We will not be having children.  We live in Charlotte, NC.  I own a law firm and I teach entrepreneurship at a local university, part-time.  My wife has been unemployed for a bit, but she just graduated with her Masters in Social Work, and she is beginning a part-time job as a mental health counselor in the next month.\n\nFirst, income.  My 2023 employment-based income:\n\n* $100,000 in salary from my law firm\n* $360,000 in distributions from my law firm\n* $5,000 or so from teaching\n\nI expect my income to grow each year, possibly by 10-15% or so, year-over-year.  My field is recession-proof, generally, and we're working on growing the firm by adding more lawyers each year.  We have 6 now (after 2 years of operation) and we'd like to ultimately have 12.  I have one law partner that I split all firm profits with, 50/50.\n\nWhen my wife begins work in the next month (1099 independent contractor), she will make around $20,000 / year.\n\nOther than my job, I own a rental property, but I rent it to friends of mine who are wonderful tenants.  They pay me just a bit more than the $1,700 mortgage each month, although I could get around $2,300 / month if I were to rent it out at market rate to someone else.  They've lived there for 3+ years and I've never had to do anything to maintain or repair the property--they take good care of it and pay rent.  My rental property is a wash and I break about even.\n\nSecond, assets and liabilities.  My current assets and liabilities are:\n\n|Description|Asset Value|Debt|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Primary Residence|$715,000|$315,000 (3.63% APR, 30 year mortgage, with 26 years left)|\n|Rental Property (across the street)|$550,000|$218,000 (3.75% APR, 30 year mortgage, with 22 years left)|\n|2024 BMW|$60,000|$0 (purchased in cash)|\n|Mutual Funds managed by Financial Advisor|$381,000|$0|\n|SoFi Savings Account (4.75% APR)|$83,000|$0 (we were saving money to buy a second home in NYC, but now we're saving to add on to our current home, see below)|\n|IRA (rolled over from 401k with my previous employer)|$97,000|$0|\n|My 401k|$56,000|$0|\n|Wife's 401k|$43,000|$0|\n|Ally Savings Account (4.75% APR, and I'm using this money exclusively to assist my aging parents, who are in ill health)|$62,000|$0|\n|Chase Bank checking and savings|$50,000|$0|\n|Wife's student loan|N/A|$28,000 (unknown interest rate because she graduated recently, but the are federally subsidized loans)|\n|TOTAL|$2,097,000|$561,000|\n\nRe: retirement savings, I started late in life.  Because I don't have much knowledge re: retirement savings, I hired a financial advisor.  The advisor charges 1% of all investments I have with him, each year, as a management fee.  My wife and I are both employed by the firm, and we max out our 401k each year.  I also deposit $10,000 into my brokerage account each month, for investment by my financial advisor.  The money is invested in a mix of funds and has grown very well in the last couple of years.\n\nFinally, we have a couple of expenditures I expect to incur in the next 2 years.  Our home is relatively small and not well suited for 2 people working from home.  Therefore, we intend to undertake a $500,000 renovation in the next year or so.  Other than this, my wife and I moved to Charlotte from New York, so we'd like to spend more time in NYC.  This may mean renting an apartment there in the next 2 years, or so.  We would spend around $4,000/month renting a place (we looked at buying and it was insanely expensive, and more reasonable to rent because we can stop renting at the end of any lease term).  If we rented a place in NYC, we would spend no more than 6 months there, to avoid paying state or city taxes in NY.\n\n**My Questions**\n\nWhen I met with my financial planner initially, they gave me some incredibly high and unobtainable amount of money that I would need to retire (something like $11,000,000).  I don't agree with their number and I'm trying to dial in on what exactly I will need to retire.  My plan is to \"soft retire\" at 55.  That likely means working part-time as a lawyer and teacher.  I would expect to make around $200,000 or so (net, today's dollars) working part-time, upon retirement at 55.  **So my first question:  what amount of money will I need to \"soft retire,\" at 55?**  Let's assume my wife and I, combined, will spend around $150,000 per year upon \"soft retirement.\"  So effectively, we can live off of my income and bank $50,000 or so for further retirement savings, each year, upon soft retirement at 55.\n\nMy rental house is another conundrum for me.  I could sell my rental house upon \"hard retirement\" (when I actually stop working), if that makes financial sense.  It would give me a big influx of cash for retirement, and the property will likely be worth much more in the future (it's in an incredibly desirable part of Charlotte with insane growth around it).  But it could also be a good source of passive income in retirement.  **So my second question:  should I sell my rental house or keep it, and if I should sell it, when?**\n\nAssuming all of the above, **my third question:  at what age could I comfortably \"hard retire\" (meaning, stop working entirely)?**  I'd like to do this around 65, if possible.\n\nFinally, **my last question:  what retirement savings elements am I missing?**  I'm maxing out 401k and putting $10,000/month into brokerage accounts.  Is there anything else I should be doing?\n\nThank you again, in advance, for any assistance or guidance you can provide me!

Thank you in advance for any assistance or guidance you can provide.  First, what I would like to accomplish; second, my current life and financial situation; and third, my questions:\n\n**What I Want to Accomplish**\n\nI want to \"soft retire\" by 55.  I'm currently 40.  Upon retirement, I want to cut my work hours to 20 or so per week, and spend a good deal of time traveling.\n\n**My Current Life & Financial Situation**\n\nI'm married, my wife and I are both 40, and we have no children.  We will not be having children.  We live in Charlotte, NC.  I own a law firm and I teach entrepreneurship at a local university, part-time.  My wife has been unemployed for a bit, but she just graduated with her Masters in Social Work, and she is beginning a part-time job as a mental health counselor in the next month.\n\nFirst, income.  My 2023 employment-based income:\n\n* $100,000 in salary from my law firm\n* $360,000 in distributions from my law firm\n* $5,000 or so from teaching\n\nI expect my income to grow each year, possibly by 10-15% or so, year-over-year.  My field is recession-proof, generally, and we're working on growing the firm by adding more lawyers each year.  We have 6 now (after 2 years of operation) and we'd like to ultimately have 12.  I have one law partner that I split all firm profits with, 50/50.\n\nWhen my wife begins work in the next month (1099 independent contractor), she will make around $20,000 / year.\n\nOther than my job, I own a rental property, but I rent it to friends of mine who are wonderful tenants.  They pay me just a bit more than the $1,700 mortgage each month, although I could get around $2,300 / month if I were to rent it out at market rate to someone else.  They've lived there for 3+ years and I've never had to do anything to maintain or repair the property--they take good care of it and pay rent.  My rental property is a wash and I break about even.\n\nSecond, assets and liabilities.  My current assets and liabilities are:\n\n|Description|Asset Value|Debt|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Primary Residence|$715,000|$315,000 (3.63% APR, 30 year mortgage, with 26 years left)|\n|Rental Property (across the street)|$550,000|$218,000 (3.75% APR, 30 year mortgage, with 22 years left)|\n|2024 BMW|$60,000|$0 (purchased in cash)|\n|Mutual Funds managed by Financial Advisor|$381,000|$0|\n|SoFi Savings Account (4.75% APR)|$83,000|$0 (we were saving money to buy a second home in NYC, but now we're saving to add on to our current home, see below)|\n|IRA (rolled over from 401k with my previous employer)|$97,000|$0|\n|My 401k|$56,000|$0|\n|Wife's 401k|$43,000|$0|\n|Ally Savings Account (4.75% APR, and I'm using this money exclusively to assist my aging parents, who are in ill health)|$62,000|$0|\n|Chase Bank checking and savings|$50,000|$0|\n|Wife's student loan|N/A|$28,000 (unknown interest rate because she graduated recently, but the are federally subsidized loans)|\n|TOTAL|$2,097,000|$561,000|\n\nRe: retirement savings, I started late in life.  Because I don't have much knowledge re: retirement savings, I hired a financial advisor.  The advisor charges 1% of all investments I have with him, each year, as a management fee.  My wife and I are both employed by the firm, and we max out our 401k each year.  I also deposit $10,000 into my brokerage account each month, for investment by my financial advisor.  The money is invested in a mix of funds and has grown very well in the last couple of years.\n\nFinally, we have a couple of expenditures I expect to incur in the next 2 years.  Our home is relatively small and not well suited for 2 people working from home.  Therefore, we intend to undertake a $500,000 renovation in the next year or so.  Other than this, my wife and I moved to Charlotte from New York, so we'd like to spend more time in NYC.  This may mean renting an apartment there in the next 2 years, or so.  We would spend around $4,000/month renting a place (we looked at buying and it was insanely expensive, and more reasonable to rent because we can stop renting at the end of any lease term).

They've lived there for 3+ years and I've never had to do anything to maintain or repair the property--they take good care of it and pay rent.

Our home is relatively small and not well suited for 2 people working from home.  Therefore, we intend to undertake a $500,000 renovation in the next year or so.  Other than this, my wife and I moved to Charlotte from New York, so we'd like to spend more time in NYC.  This may mean renting an apartment there in the next 2 years, or so.  We would spend around $4,000/month renting a place (we looked at buying and it was insanely expensive, and more reasonable to rent because we can stop renting at the end of any lease term).  If we rented a place in NYC, we would spend no more than 6 months there, to avoid paying state or city taxes in NY.\n\n**My Questions**\n\nWhen I met with my financial planner initially, they gave me some incredibly high and unobtainable amount of money that I would need to retire (something like $11,000,000).  I don't agree with their number and I'm trying to dial in on what exactly I will need to retire.  My plan is to \"soft retire\" at 55.  That likely means working part-time as a lawyer and teacher.  I would expect to make around $200,000 or so (net, today's dollars) working part-time, upon retirement at 55.  **So my first question:  what amount of money will I need to \"soft retire,\" at 55?**  Let's assume my wife and I, combined, will spend around $150,000 per year upon \"soft retirement.\"  So effectively, we can live off of my income and bank $50,000 or so for further retirement savings, each year, upon soft retirement at 55.\n\nMy rental house is another conundrum for me.  I could sell my rental house upon \"hard retirement\" (when I actually stop working), if that makes financial sense.  It would give me a big influx of cash for retirement, and the property will likely be worth much more in the future (it's in an incredibly desirable part of Charlotte with insane growth around it).  But it could also be a good source of passive income in retirement.  **So my second question:  should I sell my rental house or keep it, and if I should sell it, when?**\n\nAssuming all of the above, **my third question:  at what age could I comfortably \"hard retire\" (meaning, stop working entirely)?**  I'd like to do this around 65, if possible.\n\nFinally, **my last question:  what retirement savings elements am I missing?**  I'm maxing out 401k and putting $10,000/month into brokerage accounts.  Is there anything else I should be doing?\n\nThank you again, in advance, for any assistance or guidance you can provide me! I appreciate your time!", "comment_created_utc": 1714360611.0, "reply_text": "Do you chase ambulances?", "reply_created_utc": 1714408573.0}]}

", "comment_created_utc": 1714217811.0, "reply_text": "You've left out a crucial consideration -- what rent costs where you live or want to.    If you can get a house you like, in a place you want to live for at least 5-6 years and the cost of interest, taxes and maintenance with a normal downpayment is roughly equal to or only a little bit more than you pay for rent is \"as soon as you can\"\n\nMy guess, though, based on your income and savings rate so far, is that you are currently renting for a LOT less than the carrying cost of a 200k house at today's interest rates.  If you figure ~5k.year for property taxes and maintenance, and 7% interest on 160k, that's a little over 16000, which is about 70% of your current total spending.\n\nSo no way are you going to keep the same savings rate, even counting principal payments on the mortgage as part of your savings!\n\nso that would suggest that any attempt to buy a home will be a big rise in your expenses, and put you on a much different track.   It's probably possible if you don't mind lowering your savings rate by quite a bit. \n\nI think the real question is how committed you are to a very early retirement vs. a normal or modestly early one?\n\nIf the answer is not very, then you can probably manage the home now by pulling from Roth contributions for a 5% downpayment, paying PMI until you can get it down to 80% LTV in a few years.  But depending on the details of what you're paying in rent now and what exactly property taxes and maintenance on this property would be, that probably puts you into the realm of a 10-20% savings rate, maybe worse, maybe a little better.     You've got a fine headstart, and much of the house expense (the interest and principal paydowns) aren't going to rise with inflation, so a somewhat early retirement is not out of the questions, but any dreams of retiring at 40-45 are probably dead unless you increase your income substantially.\n\nIf you're hell bent to retire very early, the answer is probably not to buy a home at all unless your income increases a fair bit, or home prices come down relative to rents.\n\nOr maybe I'm wrong, maybe you're paying almost 1500/month in rent and somehow living on 25k/year anyway, in which case, a 200k house that you like is a great idea and you should do it now.   Either pull from your roth and HYSA for a 40k downpayment, or just get a low down payment loan (that will let you pull PMI off when LTV increases enough and pay down principal aggressively until that happens).   TBH, at today's interest rates, it wouldn't hurt to pay down principal aggressively full stop.  At least until you can refinance at a lower rate.\n\nbut you say bills would go up substantially if you bought -- so the real answer here is:  **you need to quantify that**.  By how much?  Exactly, well not exactly but you can't predict it that well, but mean with a *real* estimated amount of that cost.  Price out the mortgage, find out what taxes cost on a house you like in that price range in your area, and add on about 1% of purchase price for annual maintenance costs -- then compare that to your rent.", "reply_created_utc": 1714316888.0}, {"index": "red1_s18_c13_", "comment_text": "So I'm going to be turning 30 soon, single (unable to have kids). \n\nI'm looking at my finances knowing that I want to end up with the white picket fence life one day.

Is that wrong?\n\nFor example: \n\nMillion Dollar portfolio \n\nIt earns 25K per year in dividends and interest \n\n4% drawdown would mean 40K per year just from the million by itself, then you would have the 25K and fixed income from dividends and interest on top of them for a total of 65k per year.\n\nIt doesn't really factor into this but let's just say the whole portfolio makes an average 8% per year, and I would be subtracting dividends from that 8% not adding them on top of it.   So let's say the dividends were 3%, then growth for the year would be 5% (or less if minus the 40K I guess) because in the scenario I would have used the dividends for income for that year.", "comment_created_utc": 1714267172.0, "reply_text": "You are thinking of a different withdrawal strategy.

There are lots of online resources to help you better understand this.\n\nI recommend asking for your SS card, birth cert, and passport. If you want to step out into the world, it's a lot easier to do this with these documents.\n\nIt's probably worth having a sit-down with your parents, your dad in particular, and explaining that you want to try living on your own for a while. Getting their buy-in will make the transition substantially easier. You don't necessarily need their support, but having their understanding will make this transition a lot easier.\n\nUltimately you need to start setting boundaries in your life.

They\u2019re used to guiding you and teaching you as they have for your whole life but now that you\u2019re transitioning to your own adulthood, your parents will need to learn that how they parent you needs to change. Undoubtedly, you will do many things different than they would and that\u2019s OK. They need to stand back and let you start to learn from your own experiences and even mistakes that they can see coming but you don\u2019t. When I was your age, I ran completely out of money twice and both times due to my own lack of discipline. I had to rent an aerator one weekend and aerate a bunch of lawns to put together grocery money. My dad told me he thought about stepping in both times but instead stayed back. I\u2019m so grateful he let me struggle through that because I learned a lot and that was one of a series of experiences that led me to the principles this sub evangelizes.\u00a0 I think a healthy conversation between you and your parents about you needing autonomy and the space to figure the world out as your own person would be very appropriate right now. They love you and want to be there for you. You can let them know that the best way they can be there for you right now is to support you in whatever choices you make (you\u2019re at an age where there\u2019s a lot of choices to be made!).\u00a0 As far as the finance questions \u2014 you absolutely need to get your own bank account with no ties to your parents or anyone else.

Also, you need to have possession of your SS card, birth certificate, etc.\u00a0 When I was in your shoes at that age, my priority was to do well in school in order to set myself up for a financially successful career. I wanted to avoid student loans which it sounds like you\u2019ve been able to do.

That's after the standard deduction, which is $14,600 for a single person or $29,200.  \nIf you're single and can keep your gross income for the year below $36,600, then you get a subsidy.  \n\n> That leaves me room to rollover ~$9k from pretax to Roth (which probably isn't really enough).\n\n[Have you considered SEPP](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sepp.asp)? It's a good way to access traditional accounts.   \nA flaw with the roth conversion ladder is it requires 5 years of runway with other funds.   \nSEPP doesn't.   \nBoth of your plans requires you to increase your income to benefit from the ACA subsidies. SEPP does that while also leaving your roth contributions alone in case you need them during that 5 year runway.   \n\n> My expenses with the mortgage are about $50k and $40k without. ... just pay off the mortgage over the next 12 years ...  I owe $108k on it\n\n12 years of payments of 10k/year = 120k of mortgage expenses   \n108k to pay it off   \nIf you do not pay it off, you have 12k more in expenses over 12 years, or 1k/year.  \n\nPaying it off reduces your expenses by 10k, which is not the same as dropping your income by 10k.   \nIf you build up that 108k in cash/bonds, you can pay that 10k of mortgage with 9k from the cash + 1k in returns/income.\n\nIf you don't pay off the mortgage:  \nYour expenses are 50k/year with the mortgage.   \n* 10k comes from the 108k cash/bonds fund, 9k as contribution, 1k as gains.      \n* 20k comes from taxable account, 15k as contribution, 5k as gains   \n* 7k from dividends on taxable, all taxed   \n* 5.4k from ibonds, 4.7k from contributions, 0.7k from gains   \n* 7.6k from roth contributions, 100% untaxed\n\n50k of expenses covered   \nOnly 13.7k counts as taxable.   \nStandard deduction means that you have 0 taxable income.   \nThat's still leaves an ~23k gap for roth conversion ladder or SEPP. \n\nIf you do pay off the mortgage:   \n40k/year of expenses   \n* 20k comes from taxable account, 15k as contribution, 5k as gains   \n* 7k from dividends on taxable, all taxed   \n* 5.4k from ibonds, 4.7k from contributions, 0.7k from gains   \n* 7.6k from roth contributions, 100% untaxed \n\nStill only 12.7k of gross income, 0 taxable for ACA purposes. ~24k gap for roth conversion ladders or SEPP.   \n\nEither way, you have plenty of room for the ACA subsidy. \n\n> The extra earnings I gain from keeping the mortgage are let's say $4k/yr in the early years and less near the end as the balance drops. \n\nWith a 6% nominal gain, I have keeping the mortgage over the 12 years leaves you with +43.5k extra. Even a 3% nominal gain leaves you with +10k over paying off the mortgage, and an 8% nominal leaves you with +74.6k.    \nIt also leaves you with a more liquid asset. Liquidity has value. 100k in cash is worth more than 100k in home equity because of that liquidity. \n\n**TLDR: Based on the information you provided, paying off the mortgage has zero impact on your ACA subsidies. At first, it sounded like the driving decision for paying off the mortgage was ACA subsidies. Since paying off the mortgage isn't doesn't impact your ACA subsidies, that should not be your driving decision.
