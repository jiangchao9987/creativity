I\u2019ve got another fantasy authoring contest for you.\n\nThis is our second quarterly writing contest, which begins on each solstice and equinox. To check out the first contest, [here\u2019s our winners announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1bftnf7/official_december_solstice_2023_writing_contest/)! A few minor adjustments have been made to the format and rules of the competition, which I\u2019ll get to very soon. But first\u2026 the prompt!\n\n# Write a story about a \u201cSabotutor\u201d (a Mentor who intentionally trains their student(s) incorrectly) whose scheme could be spoiled after their poor guidance leads to an unexpected discovery.\n\nAdditional Optional Prompts:\n\n- Include an animal companion. \n- Write a sentence at least five words long where every word starts with the same letter.\n- Make your POV character trip and fall.\n\n# Rules\n\nThere is a slight change here: **We are reducing the required word count to 2,000-3,000 words.** This is to make the contest easier for both the authors and judges to meet their deadlines. \n\n- The submission must be a Google Doc. 12pt Georgia, 1-inch margins, 1.5-spaced, left-aligned. The title should be in the center-top with the author's name directly below. No fancy type-setting embellishments. The only thing that should stand out is the content of your story. [Example.](https://i.imgur.com/2aPL5Ve.png)\n- Word count should be **between 2,000 and 3,000 words.**\n- The genre must be speculative fiction. (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, magical realism, etc.)\n- Keep it PG-13. (e.g., no graphic descriptions of violence or sex, etc.)\n- **No plagiarism. No A.I.-generated content.** If found in violation of this rule, you will be immediately disqualified and banned from participating in future contests.\n\n# Your Rights\n\nAll submissions to this contest belong to their respective authors. You are free to share your story however you like whenever you like, before or after the submission deadline. We\u2019re literally just a subreddit and will not be taking any action against you for distributing your story how you want to.\n\nWith that said, by submitting your story to our contest, you are giving us permission to also share, distribute, and judge the content, with all credit to you.\n\nYou also have the right to use your Reddit username or a pseudonym as the \"Author\" if you don\u2019t want to share your real name on the anonymous internet.\n\n# Judging\n\nThis section will also be modified with a less strict rubric for judging. Rather than giving a numerical rating scale for each story\u2019s concept, prose, plot, and characters, judges will instead choose their top four entries and be asked to give justifications. Again, this makes the judging process much simpler. \n\nIf you're interested in being judge (and you are not planning to participate) you must be a member of our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7nu2Zz8StN), and you should DM me at @Page2000 with a request.\n\nLike last time, we will have a Reader\u2019s Choice Thread. However, the comment section will be unlocked this time so that people can give comments/critiques on the stories they've read. I originally had the thread locked to enable more unbiased reads, but several participants from the previous contest asked if there could be a way to receive feedback, and this seemed like an obvious solution that would also encourage engagement. \n\nThe awards will be as follows:\n\n- First Place: A special yellow flair.\n- Reader\u2019s Choice: A special green flair.\n- Runners-up (3): A special blue flair.\n\nIf the same author wins multiple awards, their flare color will be by order of the following priority: yellow, green, then blue. This goes without saying, but if you choose to participate in the competition, there is a chance you may not win anything at all. Please don\u2019t take this too personally, and feel free to try next time!\n\nTimeline: (Subject to change)\n\n- 19 March 2024: Submissions Open\n- 30 April 2024: Submissions Close / Reader\u2019s Choice Thread\n- 1 June 2024: Winners Announced\n- 20 June 2024: Next Contest Begins\n\n# [Submit Your Story Here](https://forms.gle/yaCQfTfktQYLZ9c5A)\n\nTo submit, you must include the following:\n\n1. Title of the story\n2. Your Reddit username\n3. A one-sentence blurb\n4. A Google Doc with your story\n\nTo share your Google Doc, press \u201cShare\u201d on the top right, under \u201cGeneral Access\u201d select \u201cAnyone with a link,\u201d make sure the role is set to \u201cViewer,\u201d and then press \u201cCopy Link.\u201d Paste the link into the submission form.\n\n***\n\nIf you haven't already, join our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/7nu2Zz8StN) where you can participate in word sprints, find beta readers, and brainstorm ideas for your entries.\n\nI also apologize for the delayed activity and response from me over the past few months.

The most venerated are the battle mages who are force multipliers against the \u201cdemons\u201d who periodically invade this world. They can draw additional power from the environment or even other living beings. The most reviled are those battle mages who can draw power not just from other beings, but from their blood. The trade-off is that this corrupts the mage\u2019s mind and shortens his life. \n\nIn fact, this blood magic ability is so dangerous that children are tested for this ability from an early age and put to death if they exhibit it. Unless, of course, someone in power can game the system and make it look like the child has no such ability. Enter the protagonist who, during a battle gone horribly wrong, discovers that he is a blood mage. The shining beacon of might and honor is now the most feared being on the planet.

Majority of fantasy readers expect magic to be in their stories.   I'd instead start with your MC.  Give us a name.  Tell the reader why he's a beacon of might and honor for the humans.  Did he singlehandedly turn the tide against the invading demons?   Once you set him up in your first paragraph, then drop the hammer with the blood magic reveal and tell us how much he's fallen.   Maximus goes from General of the Roman Legions to a slave with his family crucified.   What does your MC lose when its revealed he's a blood mage?   Then tell the reader his options.

Throughout your entire blurb Mark doesn't actually choose anything, everything happens to him and he's sort of just along for the ride.  I think what would interest me more is if you tie Mark's dream of being an artist with the curse.  Like, he made a pact (unknowingly because he doesn't think the supernatural is real) that marks him, so the curse will kill him eventually (or make him the vessel for the eldritch god or whatever), but in the meantime his artist skills become amazing and he's starts to get noticed (which is how the cultists find out about him).   So this creates a personal dilemma for the protagonist, he can fulfill his dream and end up in a horrible fate or live out the rest of his life amounting to nothing.\n\nI'd also tie his magic abilities to his art too, which doubles the complication because if he's cured he loses his connection with magic too.

Although there are varying ideas about what needs to be done to prepare for his return, there are some who are aware that the deity Dinayru has been forging a \"weapon\" to destroy the Abyss... but not all who are aware of this oppose Nihlrung. Action must be taken, both to find this \"weapon\" and to prepare a world in conflict for a war greater than any seen in eons.\n\nThe hook: I'm aiming to appeal with my world-building (exploring places like the underground city of Ost Nuin and the Mad King Xeph's Puzzle Tower of Reva Tirazom, encountering peoples like the *kiruku* dwarves and their whalewolves in the far south, etc.), characters that feel human (capturing the little things like mannerisms and whatnot that make characters relatable, inspired by what Studio Ghibli accomplishes with their animations), and a plot that is constantly building toward satisfying payoffs (my natural habit is to come up with endings first and build everything else afterwards, so plot twists and conclusions should feel like all the pieces are there in the build-up).\n\nThe story might seem a tad generic in its premise (\"the Dark Lord is coming back and we need to find the one thing that can stop him\"), but twists and revelations abound that flesh out or straight up change the perception of the world and what is happening. Some of the biggest examples:\n\n* Dinayru isn't actually a deity; it is the collective consciousness of all of the aether in the universe, a collective desire to simply *exist*.\n* Nihlrung's goal is a bit deeper than simply destroying the universe. The Abyss revealed to him The Star as It Once Was, a paradoxical state of \"being-without-being\" before Dinayru's aether spread existence to every corner of the universe. There was no here or there, happiness or sadness, satisfaction or pain, purpose or irrelevance. Due to horrifying traumatic events, Nihlrung sought to wield the power of the Abyss to return the world to what it was (whether this goal is altruistic or selfish is the line he toes as a villain).\n* The \"weapon\" that Dinayru is forging is an individual, who is being filled with \"weaponized aether\" that will be used to destroy the Abyss once and for all. But who has this aether, and what it will do to them, begins in uncertainty.\n\nThe themes: There are many themes I look forward to exploring throughout the story, such as self-acceptance, necessary evil, sacrifice, change, etc. But the main theme that will become central to the story is a sort of \"giving up vs persisting\" examination of suicide; Nihlrung wants to effectively end the world as we know it to run from misery, while Shiya (a young *kiruku* dwarf boy who is one of the main characters) will represent persistence, innocent love, and the desire to preserve the good (even in the face of much loss, as Nihlrung attempts to break his spirit)."}, {"comment_author": "Slight-Ad-5442", "comment_text": "A boy who grew into a man who joined an ancient order of protectors only to realise too late that their past glories are behind them now wants to leave but tells himself he needs a reason.

To live a life and have a family with the person she loved in her past life and finds out she still does in the next. Its supposed to really explore the concept of soulmates, the sorta lonliness you can feel knowing deep down you do have a specific one, and that romance can be timeless. \n\nWhile the story does focus on the romance and turbulence of navigating such feelings or adjusting to such a situation, do you love the person for who they were, who they are, or all of them, there is a bit more to it. For one its a way to sorta figure out the world in a less\u2026intense?\u2026format.

You might also put *Belgariad* in that category.  This is in contrast to the 1990's, when  you saw the epic fantasy dominated by authors who were doing things that were considered relatively new and experimental at the time, like George R.R. Martin's *A Song of Ice and Fire* (an epic fantasy that was more political and less straightforwardly a tale of good vs evil), and Robert Jordan's *The Wheel of Time* (which was the start of a push toward more \"hard magic\" systems, with Jordan slowly leading his audience further in that direction over the course of the series.\n\nSo, if you're ignoring \"Tolkien-clones\" as a genre and focusing on the sort of works you mentioned, I guess the 80's is a place where you saw the start of dark fantasy that, unlike a lot of fantasy published in the past 25 years, *wasn't* trying to follow in the mold of *A Song of Ice and Fire*, and was instead telling stories on a much smaller scale with a relatively small cast of characters."}, {"comment_author": "J_C_F_N", "comment_text": "Drugs, most likelly."}, {"comment_author": "bizoticallyyours83", "comment_text": "Okay, this cracked me up \ud83d\ude06\u00a0"}, {"comment_author": "bizoticallyyours83", "comment_text": "Genuine passion for the genre.

But often there are other ways of telling the story. \n\nSomeone above brought up Wheel of Time, and a common criticism of this series (which I mostly love) is that there's significant POV bloat. There are literally dozens of throwaway characters who appear for only a single scene (and dozens more side characters who get their own occasional POVs). Most of those throwaway characters are completely forgettable. I even forget half the more significant side characters names.

They've definitely widened my perspective. I am more aware of needing to be careful about distinguishing each character, but I'm also satisfied with how I've been doing it thus far and I will continue to do so.\n\nTo add some context that might alleviate the issues, book 1 will be focused around the main character, his two companions, and the one villain that wants him dead. There will be side characters introduced, but these are the only characters that receive a POV. Out of the 30 chapters, the main character receives about 25, the villain about 2 and the deutaragonists 3. This establishes who our main cast is before we bombard them with new characters.\n\nBook 1 introduced around 8-10 side characters that do receive love, and most of which continue to show up consistently for the rest of the story. They begin getting POVs in book 2, though the main character still has about half the chapters.\n\nMy story doesn't really dismiss characters very often. If I introduce someone, odds are they're here to stay. So you won't see random POVs from characters we'll never see again. They will always be characters that we've already been introduced to, and we will rarely be learning about them through their first POV. \n\nAnother thing I should bring up is that I absolutely love all of my characters. I know there's a lot, but of the 30+ there's only a couple that I haven't really connected with. My main character is obviously important, but so are my side characters. The vast majority of them have their own stories, conflicts, emotions and relationships that undergo development across the story. That's why I have so many POVs. If there's anything I pride myself on, it's how alive my cast feels. And that means that they all contribute towards the overarching story with their individual developments. That's why I won't zero in on just a handful of POVs. So when it comes to what I want to write, I think the multiple POVs of relevant characters is okay. Removing some will remove their character.\n\nHowever I do understand that the reader won't feel the same way. If and when I do another draft, I will absolutely consider trimming down the quantity of POVs, and more importantly, I'll make sure they all sound different. They sound distinct in my head, but I cant confirm that others will agree.

How are they supporting and enriching *that story*?\n\nFor instance (speaking in generic fantasy tropes), if you are showing an assassin passing through a town your hero has visited, asking folk about them, that can be great. You're creating tension, you're hinting at a bigger picture, and you can plant clues for the reader to look out for - can they spot the assassin before the hero does?\n\nIf someone is ordering the siege of a city the hero is headed for, again, potentially great.

Some have a large cast of povs but not all of those povs are necessary (aSoIaF); some characters may be stronger without the internal monologue (Cersi; Sansa). Some series have a limited cast of povs but occasionally pop into a secondary or tertiary pov to create an effect (WoT) which is what this sounds like.\n\nThe largest risk is to the story. Story is not plot. So if you\u2019re jumping into secondary characters just to show a reader something, that something needs to be necessary. Secondly, if you\u2019re jumping into other povs with regularity those characters need their own stories, plot-lines, and development to feel valid. Otherwise they exist solely as a camera and that feels cheap.\n\nWhat this means is consistency. If you\u2019re using consistent characters to show other angles, those characters need development to be valuable. You could, otherwise, not use the same secondary povs. That might be kind of interesting, asides to the main story. You should, still, develop those povs but it would be a neat challenge.\n\nThe other option is to use Third Omniscient as your pov, so the camera is everyone and anyone and the narrative is allowed information your main character doesn\u2019t know. Your camera mainly follows them, but if you use your page structure well you can show a reader when you\u2019re changing to another character. Omniscient is not \u201cin style\u201d these days, but was popular in the earlier decades of the 1900s up until the 70s or so, depending on genre.\n\nThe other consideration is: why do you think the reader needs to know those things? Keeping information withheld is a huge way to increase tension and put the reader under stress, so to speak.

Example:\n\nThe Corinor Disaster\n\nKing Thomas, Hugeland Summer Castle \n\nDuring this character's intro, his failing health was described as \"on his deathbed.\" His point of view voice is made unique because all his new info comes from different advisors whom he holds in varying degrees of trust and disdain. The actual advisors really don't need much more than a title to be announced before entry into the King's chambers. Their voices are more like reports, most of the time.\n\nUsing a fixed, unique to that pov voice, location helps readers to quickly remember who is talking to them.\n\nUsing different voices is a must but readers may have a problem distinguishing between them. A good example is a Scottish Highland accent when written looks similar to an Irish Coastal, although they actually are clearly different when heard. This means you need more extensive backgrounds for these pov characters so their life experience can show in the way they describe events, who they like, dislike, or are ambivalent towards. To prevent these voices from feeling one dimensional to the reader I find myself including minor character arcs into the overall story/mc arcs.\n\nDone well is not lazy, it's a lot of extra work both before and during story development and writing.

Each main POV is effectively a book on their own. \n\nSo if I were to write a standalone with one main character, it could be 100,000 with four side POVs at 10k each. That\u2019s reasonable. At the same time, if I wanna write a massive doorstopper, I can have four main characters, with 300,000 words between them, with 100,000 for the 20 side POVs I throw in.\n\n30 POVs in total is still crazy.

Nothing I hate more that enjoying a story, then having to pause it for a while to see the story of someone I dislike or am indifferent towards. This becomes especially problematic if the story that interests you disappears for most of the book (or entirely, to be payed off in some future hypothetical book) for no clear reason.\n\n2-Very few authors can really pay it off. Seriously, if you've got multiple perspectives, they've got to come together at the end of your writings (ideally, the book itself) and then there needs to be some kind of payoff for having these multiple perspectives. If the end state would make as much sense following just one perspective, then the rest is at best a distraction.\n\n3-Narratives become scattered. When you've got those multiple perspective, it can get frustrating if they're too distant from one another because it can be hard to grasp the point of it all. This is especially problematic with longer books, where there can be dozens to hundreds of pages between sections with the same characters.\n\nAnyways, this is what's made me dislike multi-perspective narratives as a reader. I actively avoid very long books (or continuous book series) for those very reasons these days. And look, younger me had more tolerance for that.

My current project is divided into chapters that feel massively long (chapter 1 is nearly 14,000 words) but are split into several scenes (around 1,000 to 3,000 words) with scene breaks in between. I've been wondering about abandoning the chapters entirely and numbering the scenes, so they're kind of treated as chapters but they don't start on a new page each time."}, {"comment_author": "Logisticks", "comment_text": ">Most of my chapters are at the 1500 to 2000 word count.\n\nThis is *more* than okay for a single-POV story. In fact, thrillers are sometimes paced even faster than that.  For example, take *The Da Vinci Code* by Dan Brown, which is a single-POV story where the average chapter length is 1350 words, and due to the short chapter length, the book is 103 chapters long in total.\n\nThe thing about a single POV story is that, if the reader feels like your chapters are \"too short,\" they can just read another chapter.  In fact, that is sort of intentional in the case of Dan Brown's novels; they're paced quickly to make them more addictive and give you the appetite to read just one more chapter before going to bed.\n\nThe main place where short chapters become a \"problem\" is when you never get the chance to spend much time with the same character. And even then, ~2000 word chapters are fine: *Jurassic Park* hops around a lot, and it still averages just under 2000 words per chapter.\n\nIt's common for chapters to be longer in the fantasy genre, because they tend to have stories that are paced slower than a typical thriller, and will sometimes spend more time dwelling on the setting and describing details to give the reader a greater sense of immersion.  But as you note, your story doesn't require a ton of \"worldbuilding,\" it sounds like your premise is sort of like Jurassic Park in the sense that it's \"like the real world with a few things changed.  There's no reason your fantasy story can't be paced like a thriller."}]}, {"post_title": "The Kindling Pyres - Embers of Mourning Excerpt [Flintlock Fantasy, 1615 WC]", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1byoea0/the_kindling_pyres_embers_of_mourning_excerpt/", "post_main_text": "Looking for general feedback, impressions of writing style, and weaknesses.

They are referred to as Pyres hence the series name: The Kindling Pyres. Essentially instead of a horrifying navy, the British empire developed suits which turn their armies into super soldiers in various ways using Pyromancy.

But you can go all in either way.\n\nI would begin by thinking about the cultures/peoples depicted in your story: Is everyone of the same background? If not, then it makes sense to have names sound different depending on where the characters are from. For example, in *The Lord of the Rings*, the names of hobbits generally sound traditionally British; the names of the people of Rohan are all Anglo-Saxon; the names of the dwarves are all Norse; the names of the elves and of the people of Gondor are in Tolkien's invented Elvish; the names of orcs and such are in the Black Speech; and various other cultures have their own sorts of names\u2014for example, Gh\u00e2n-buri-Gh\u00e2n.\n\nComing up with distinct sounds for different peoples/cultures is not only realistic, but helpful to readers, because it helps them keep straight who is from where, and it gives a feeling of the cultures being represented.

Sometimes I feel like I type out the full character name too often?\n\n\\~\\~CONTEXT for scene: Delphene is a necromancer down on her luck who is trying to siphon magic from sirens in a bog. She and her faithful accountant, Sigero, are riding on the back of a Kelpie in the early hours of the night. She brought jewelry to entice them close enough to trick. She is wearing a ruby imbued with the power to safe guard her own magic from being sucked away by the sirens who think she is the prey.\n\nThis is the second scene from my rough draft about 1,600 words deep into my first pages.\n\nDelphy brought her lantern. Sigero had brought an even larger one.\n\nThe ancient twisted trees encroached on the narrow path. Each branch sent shadows across the moonlight until only a trickle of starlight reached the darkness of the forest floor. Even in the day, the mushrooms and moss lived in stagnant shadow, but at night, the dark gash of the path they rode upon might as well be a black velvet shroud that hid the very air in front of one\u2019s eyes. The light of their lanterns, as it hit the fungus covered trees, felt like a shrinking room.\n\nHer arm grew tired of holding the lantern high. The kelpie below them seemed unbothered by the darkness and more bothered by their light, which reflected pink iridescence from the bean shaped pupils of the beast. It loved the green water of the bog, and it would take them to the wettest part of the forest with little guidance.\n\nSoon enough, the air grew thick with the smell of wet moss and still water. The green stench came with buzzing little pests. Moths and night beetles all made their way to the hundreds of mouths they heard croaking and screeching. The song of frogs swelled until they could no longer hear the kelpie\u2019s hooves squelch through the saturated duvet of moss and algae.\n\nDelphene\u2019s eyelids could not be wide enough to see past their limited halo of lantern glow. The range of her vision gave just enough time to dip under a hanging tapestry of tree moss or dodge the occasional shelf mushroom that invaded the narrow wake of the kelpie.\n\nDelphy and Sigero hissed together when the ground gave way to bog and the kelpie happily waded shoulder deep into the muck, leaving a cold slurry of mud and duckweed to wash over the stirrups, up to the edge of their riding boots. She lifted her knees, hoping they would not swim any deeper.\n\n\u201cThere!\u201d Sigero whispered urgently in her ear. \u201cA strong one. And do you feel the weaker ones? They\u2019ve sensed you for certain.\u201d\n\nDelphy handed her lantern to Sigero. She pulled the kelpie to a stop. It sunk deep enough to let mud into Sigero\u2019s boots. He clucked a disappointed tongue at her. The incessant wall of frog-calls came to a sudden silence. She shushed him and they both strained their ears to listen to the darkness; the huffs of the kelpie breathing, the moths bouncing off the lantern glass, the drips of condensation from the branches to the bog like a gentle rain.\n\nA cold slimy hand shot from the still surface and grabbed the crook of her knee.\n\nThe kelpie bayed.\n\nSigero hiss a cursed through a sharp inhale. Delphene fought to swallow her scream and remain composed.\n\nSlick purplish skin stretched over an elegant, feminine figure. Her hair carried the same green as the duckweed within it. As her head rose slowly from under the surface, her wide-set eyes batted their lashes and her pupils contracted. The siren's eyes had the same iridescence as the kelpie\u2019s. Delphene hid the lanterns behind her to dim the glow then straightened her posture and calmed the kelpie.\n\nThe siren pet Delphene\u2019s leg and rested her gaunt, periwinkle cheek on her knee, leaving wet prints wherever she touched her. She stayed neutral through her annoyance. Sirens had no sense of personal boundaries and manners.\n\n\u201c*The* Delphene Moriah. What a pleasure. What brings you to our bog this fine night?\u201d Her voice was coarse and gargled with saliva.\n\nJust as she predicted, the sirens were all drooling at the thought of devouring two weakened witches. She fought the urge to clutch her ruby pendant. She hoped Sigero had brought his own defenses.\n\nSirens were naked but never without a neck full of jewels. This siren\u2019s hand had an eclectic mixture of rings on every finger. Delphy hoped she brought her taste. She held the satchel tight and lifted from it her first enticement, a heavy ring encrusted with opals and pearls. The siren licked her lips.\n\nDelphene tried not to sense Sigero\u2019s silent judgment behind her. He must think her genius plan was pawning her belongings. This was why she wanted to go alone.\n\nThough she was not as inept at measuring the power within other magical creatures as Sigero, she could feel the raw magic inside this siren emanating like the reverberation of the ground before a stampede.\n\nHow lucky.\n\nSigero cocked his head to the side. \u201cWhat is your name? You have a body full of magic to spend tonight. How did a siren gather so much power?\u201d\n\nThe siren gave him one sideways glance, \u201cMy name is Uma.\", then turned back to Delphene. \"What else did you bring?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnswer him.\u201d Delphy scraped a speck of power and placed it into her command.\n\nUma flinched and removed her hand from Delphene\u2019s thigh.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been busy. Lucky really. I met a vampire. A young thing from the Absalom clan. He took a liking to me, invited me into his castle to swim in his pool.

He gave no care, he felt almost no drain, and he sent me on my way. All he wanted was a pint of blood and a quick seduction. The magic inside me lay untouched. Stronger than ever.\u201d\n\nDelphene had rarely crossed paths with vampires. Vampires, though sustained on magic same as anyone, sought blood, not the power within it as she did. Their needs were primal, almost natural, like that of any beast or any human. Did humans not hunt to survive, to consume flesh and waste the blood?

This is just a great punchy line to me. You could rework it to be punchier but it paints such a vivid scene. And that is just one line. Your strongest aspect is certainly your fantastic descriptions. The page is just painted with them. And your characters are fun! You display a lot with so little in the beginning. Siergo gives off this turt, sassy vibe as the situation befalls them, but valuable as he is the first to point out the Siren's lair.\n\nThe only reason I am not rating this higher is some of your descriptions, while beautiful, take over action. I've been listening to the Essence of Writing a Novel lately and I highly recommend the episode on scene. There are times where your scenes are becoming summary. Salt grain given, fantasy does has a higher tolerance for immersive language. But in the beginning, we start losing scene and moving into summary.\n\n>Her arm grew tired....hoping they would not swim any deeper.\n\nThe painting you are making is beautiful, but it really lacks action and conflict. We tend to set up our scenes to knock the reader down, but it isn't necessary all the time. We don't get action until \"There!\" Granted, this isn't a lot of text, but I have an instinct that you tend towards the worldbuilding a lot. It works for you. What I would suggest is to look over some of your passages and see if the text could be re-worked to to add in forward momentum you may be losing. Emphasis on may. Simple things can do that. Here's a rough example:\n\n\"It loved the green water of the bog, and it would take them to the wettest part of the forest with little guidance. Delphene braced herself. The thickness of wet moss and dank water painted the air and draped over her eyelids. Their quarter loved to make station in the durge of the swamp. Where pests buzzed in the ear and night beetles fed the hungry hundreds of croaking toads. Each one baled a deafening song that drowned out the Kelpies's hooves and almost pushed out all of Delphene's thoughts. But she would not be detered. She would make her mark.\"\n\nNot every passage needs this, of course. But you keep the momentum of your scenery by filtering it through your characters or showing why it is necessary.\n\nOutside of that, your dialogue could use some sharpening. It may just be weaker as compared to your descriptions though:\n\n>Sigero cocked his head to the side. \u201cWhat is your name? You have a body full of magic to spend tonight. How did a siren gather so much power?\u201d\n\nFor example, the above reads a bit odd. Maybe it is the vibe you are going for but it seems you are just trying to convey its power to the reader. Something like this might work:\n\n\"Delphy,\" Sigero hushed. \"This thing is *filled* to the brim with magic. I've never seen a Siren this strong.\"\n\n>\u201cI\u2019ve been busy. Lucky really. I met a vampire. A young thing from the Absalom clan. He took a liking to me, invited me into his castle to swim in his pool. When he took me to bed, I thought he would drink me, but I drank him.

All he wanted was a pint of blood and a quick seduction. The magic inside me lay untouched. Stronger than ever.\u201d\n\nThis passage in particular felt a bit cheesy. I wasn't sure if it was intended or not. The following passage seems to indicate it might be. I think this could be fixed with a less is more approach. In relation to the previous rec I made:\n\n\"Oh you noticed?\" She touched her gems as though complimented. \"I've been *so* busy. I tempted a young vampire from the Absalom clan. I swam in his pool and his sheets. I drained him of *everything* before he could sink his fangs into me. He was so weak in the knees he didn't even ask for any blood. Just gave me a spank and sent me on my way!\"\n\n\"Enough. What's your name?\" Delphy scraped a speck of power and placed it into her command.\n\nThe siren hissed, pulling its hand away. \"Uma.\"\n\nJust some examples. Take it as you will.

She turned her head expectantly.\n\n\u201cDarling, your father has asked for you to join him in the throne room,\u201d her mother stated apprehensively.\n\nCallie sighed. \u201cWhat does he need me for?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say, but he asked that I send for you at once.\u201d The queen consort\u2019s face tightened in awareness of Callie\u2019s frustration.\n\n\u201cAsk him to give me twenty minutes.\u201d\n\nCallie pulled off her thick leather gloves, noticing the layer of dirt that had traveled up her arms and toward her elbows. She closed her eyes, willing her body to once again fill with the stillness that had heightened her senses and lowered her anxiety just moments before. She acknowledged that the effort was futile, but longed for that calm nonetheless.", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "apham2021114", "comment_text": "Hey, I remember this! I left some comments, but they're really subjective to my taste. Keep what works for you and what you prefer to read.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\n\nThe beginning is missing a hook, a catchy line or idea to get the reader to buy into the garden bit. In a crime/thriller it might be \"Three shots went off and my father fell to the ground;\" or in a isekai it might be \"I went outside and greeted my best friend, Truck-kun;\" and etc. It could transform the opening paragraph into something more than her tending to the garden. Callie seemed to like nature, so maybe your hook could be theme around that. Or you could center it around her longing for peace and freedom for a contrast with what happens later on.\n\nI left an example in the comments on dialogue. Basically, try not to point something out and then do it. Just do it. The pacing is faster, and the action commands the reader's attention. While we're on dialogue, on the next revision I would go through and try to get rid of most if not all adverbs in a dialogue tag.\n\n>\u201cDarling, your father has asked for you to join him in the throne room,\u201d her mother stated apprehensively.\n\nYou want to move that apprehensiveness into the dialogue. Make it so that we can tell her mom's mental state by dialogue alone. And if you find yourself getting blocked here, then add the adverb and come back later.\n\nThere were quite a few characters in this chapter. I felt like the king was the most memorable by role, because he's the king. The others not so much. It's a problem with introducing so many characters in one chapter, but I would try to give them a defining trait or role.\n\nCallie had some zeist, but quickly felt inactive, especially in the throne scene where I felt like she's barely a pov. Her status elevates her to the royal family but she's no different from any of the other suitable cameras that could be installed there. There's a distinct lack of want and reaction coming from Callie, she feels like she has little drive to the scene. This is evident when she went to the throne room and the focal immediately goes to the king. Prior to this, she was running it. You'll have to find a way to spice her up so that she stays relevant and interesting in the confines and restraints of her character and social status.\n\nIt's only after when she had a 1-on-1 with her father that it felt like she was the pov again. This could be what was intended, to show her helplessness in the face of social power, but then immediately after she had the balls to speak her mind, so no this couldn't be it. That throne scene felt the most problematic in terms of Callie being a pov.\n\nDialogue overall felt much better than the previous draft. Sometimes it is exposition, but it's properly inserted and made sense given the context. I didn't have a problem with the dialogue itself with any characters, but the dialogue tags could get a bit eh at some points. I left some comments on parts where it felt iffy.\n\nThere were many times where you'd point at something (tell) and then proceeded to show it. You could just skip the tell and show it.\n\nPacing felt a bit iffy. Probably because of the above. I was onboard with the chapter before the throne scene. I wasn't exactly sure what the opening was building up to, but Callie had a rebellious nature and I found that fun. But then the throne scene lasted for quite a long time in a ratio that I felt wasn't properly built for it. It was a necessity that needed more support before the scene occur to make me want it more.\n\nThe scene with Jane was my favorite of the scenes. Where everyone just seems like cookie-cutter representation of their roles (princess, prince, king, queen), Jane appeared grounded. She actually seemed like a friend with the right priorities.\n\nOverall this was a drastic change from the previous iteration. I much prefer this direction!"}]}, {"post_title": "Spellblades [Grim Epic Fantasy - 3032]", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1byggqu/spellblades_grim_epic_fantasy_3032/", "post_main_text": "[Spellblades Short Story](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hy09hsen1ugt43Y7dZacKoCITTjrbxFsyidPyObD8IU/edit?usp=drivesdk)\n\nGreetings fellow writers!

The Man sat entranced by their dance as they trailed upwards out of sight. He began to wonder how high they could go, what could they see? Could they see the fractured earth, where it splintered and uprooted from itself? Perhaps they might see the wicker trees, lifeless and stale, warped into a twisted state of an inbred grove. If they made it high enough, they could see far past the plains, where the land bordered by ash gave way to green.\n\nHe grew sullen of their departure and freedom, a fortnight had passed since he came to the Waste in self-exile - or had it been longer? Three weeks, four? It was hard to keep track when each day of monotony was the same as the last, and each passing night - with no one but himself for company - his thoughts clouded and sank like dregs to the back of his mind.\n\nA low ruffle from the long grass perked his ears and the Man snapped to attention like a dog on guard; perfectly still. A long moment passed and the brush didn\u2019t move. He tried to convince himself that it was the wind, that there was little likelihood of any vile creatures - besides himself - wandering about; but there was that little nag, again. A small feeling that even out there, where all creatures went to die, there was something watching. \n\nThe cold sweat running down his neck helped ease him back into the moment and he returned his attention to the fire. Though his knee refused to stop fidgeting, his eyes kept darting back to the source of sound, and his breath ran rapid. He willed himself to stop but his body worked to the rhythm of his paranoia.\n\nThe tempo of his twitching limbs ran their course and soon the crackle of fire grounded his senses, and\u2026 the smell of burning? The skewers erupted in flames, he cursed and swiped them from the fire before blowing them out on his meal. With his food now charred the Man sighed and sat back down. It wasn\u2019t a complete loss, the food couldn\u2019t be made worse. He examined the cockroaches that lined the skewers and brought his feast in and began to eat. Once a piece broke off he pulled away, cringing as he took each slow bite. The first bite was always the hardest. How the crunch reverberated through his mouth to the back of the head. \n\nAnother bite, then another.\n\nHe cringed less and less with each chunk but still hesitated every offer he brought to himself.

I'm a new writer, but an avid reader.\n\n1. I'd like to know more context as to why the man walked past your MC without notice if they are the only two people in a seemingly empty parking garage. At first, I pictured this scene occurring on a busy street which would explain why he paid her no mind. It sounds like she is standing there pretty suspiciously.\n\n2. Why does the man talk to himself? I don't think most people would do that, even in an empty parking garage. His dialogue at the beginning would probably be occurring in his head. The reader doesn't need it, and to me it breaks the immersion.\n\n3. What are the signs? Maybe this is established earlier in your story, but it would help to get some more detail as to why he is being targeted specifically. What stands out about this man to your MC?\n\n4. The MC doesn't seem surprised when the man is taken over by some supernatural or spiritual presence. Why does she then keep talking to the man as if he is the one who would respond? Shouldn't her tone shift, now speaking to this entity? She shouldn't expect him to come back to his body and willingly answer her questions if he would go to such a length to avoid them, or if he is unwillingly being taken by something else.\n\n5. It seems a little too easy for your MC to find their answer on a note in the man's pocket after all that.

They kill people before they're supposed to die, and whilst they watch their loved ones kill them.\n\nLet's develop this a bit. Firstly, the \"before their time\" part.\n\nThis is a god, a god of death at that, so they're presumably immortal. This means they wouldn't have a good understanding of the human lifespan. Perhaps the god forsees a human dying of a horrible, painful disease and does them the mercy of killing them beforehand. However, in reality, the disease isn't even present in the victim's body for another 40 years, when they're already old. For the god, 40 years is nothing. Right around the corner. He doesn't understand that, for a human, that's a lot of opportunities they've just been robbed from. \n\nThe god believes he's doing the right thing by letting the people die before they need to suffer, so we can empathise with him, but he's undoubtedly wrong because he doesn't perceive time like us. We can't fault him for that because we know it's not really his fault. \n\nLet's move onto the second part, where he sends monsters that take the shape of their loved ones.\n\nPerhaps this is the gods attempt at understanding humans. I'm sure that, across history, people have said countless times how they'd be content with their last sight being the person they love. It's a romantic saying, and it's not untrue. The god, however, interprets this as a death being optimal if it's been done by a loved one. You want to see your loved one before you die? Don't worry, she's killing you with a warm smile. That's what humans want, right?\n\nIt's cruel, but he doesn't know that. In theory, it should make sense. You'd rather see your loved ones when you die than a random murderer. That's a fact. But in practice, he's once again failed to understand how humans work.\n\nThese are mostly aspects you've already created, but now that we've developed his motivations, we can see that this isn't a bad person. He's a god of death but he has good intentions, and therefore we can always empathise with him. He's trying to do the right thing.\n\nBut because we're human, we can see the issues immediately. The problems with his methods that he can't quite process. We can feel bad for him, since he's unaware of how badly his methods are. But no one wouldn't argue that he needs to be stopped because he's doing the wrong thing."}, {"comment_author": "AiDiZi", "comment_text": "Dive deep into the villain's backstory/motivation to show that they are not purely evil but rather driven by complex emotions and experiences.

As I refine the magic system, simultaneously trying to decide how much it should matter to the overall plot, I think regardless of the totality of its impact, it would be unwise for the dragon fire (and other elemental breaths) to be infinitely spammable. \n\nI don't want something as plain as they can only use their breath X number of times per day for whatever reason, if they do it too much they get tired, or it has to recharge over a short period. I think without more concrete limits or a drawback, the characters would use this magic way too much and that wouldn't be too interesting. \n\nSo I was hoping I could get some help refining potential ideas. \n\n**1) Consuming a Magic Source**\n\nIn this case, the dragons would have to eat a special mineral or other magically-imbued item in order to use their breath weapons. When the source of magic is a physical object, however, this has major implications for the economy of the world. Where does the source grow? How is it collected? Let's say its a mineral that must be mined. Whoever controls the largest magic mine would be the most powerful person/nation. What motivation would they have to ever share this magic with their neighbors? If they didn't, warfare over the region would be constant (even if smaller deposits did grow elsewhere, everyone would want to be top dog). I worry this idea, while already laden with ideas for conflict, doesn't necessarily mesh with the ideas I already have for the story,. Not that I'm not in an early enough stage to change this, to be fair. \n\n**2) Bleeding Weave**\n\nAnother idea is to have magic be something more intangible, like the Weave in D&D, that exists between the fabric of reality. It is everywhere, but difficult to access. Dragons have the innate ability to pluck at this Weave, granting themselves power, but doing so leaves a hole behind. The more the magic is used, the more unstable the environment around them becomes. This means using breath weapons during a battle would leave the area of the battle scarred with unstable magic, creating pockets of dangerous regions throughout the world, and use of this magic in populated areas would be highly restricted due to this danger. This approach means using their breath weapons is sort of a moral choice each and every time, and uses would be few and far between outside of life or death situations. More of a focus could be put on how the people of the world are trying to mend these holes, or at least contain the wild magic, which could have interesting implications on the overall plot. \n\n**3) Physical Toll**\n\nOne approach is to imagine how letting out a jet of hot flame from one's mouth might be physically damaging. Scarred tongues and mouth, eroded teeth, etc. With this approach, you can use the breath weapon, and then you'd have to wait for the mouth to heal before doing so again, and if you don't, you risk permanent damage. So, overuse can comprises one's ability to eat, drink, or speak properly. This is the approach with the least possible implication on the overall plot, but perhaps add some \"realism\" and interesting background to the world to imagine a sort of disability associated with overuse, so perhaps war veterans are recognizable by the burns on their mouths and such. \n\nHow do these ideas sound? Are there more interesting concepts you can think of I might be able to use? Thanks!

I think without more concrete limits or a drawback, the characters would use this magic way too much and that wouldn't be too interesting. \n\nTo be honest, I disagree. I've always interpreted a dragon's fire breath as a physical ability of theirs (like flying). And all physical abilities have limits.\n\nIt'd be a whole lot more practical if we humans were to just sprint everywhere. It'd get us places quicker. And in a fight we'd be harder to hit. So why don't we? Because it's exhausting.\n\nIf you were to imagine a dragon breathing fire, that's them exhaling. Right now, try to exhale and see how long you can hold it for. Odds are you won't be able to keep it up very long, and afterwards you'll feel winded. If that's the drawback to humans of breathing out, I think it's reasonable that it could apply to dragons too.\n\nSo I'd say go with your third idea, but it doesn't need to be so extreme. The idea of the fire burning the inside of their mouths can go because, to be harsh, it's unrealistic. If an animal has evolved to breathe fire, why wouldn't it have evolved to have fire-resistant teeth as well? If one of your dragons are really pushing themselves to their limit in a battle, then a burnt tooth or two could be an interesting after-effect to demonstrate how they were going beyond their limits. But to have it be a general concern for every dragon every time they breathe fire? It sounds to me like they'd rather never use it, and that means they never would have evolved to have it.\n\nDragons can only breathe fire for as long as their lungs will allow. Naturally, they'll have greater lung capacity than humans but, as a physical ability, their breath will eventually tire out their lungs and they won't be able to breathe fire anymore. It would also likely lead to their movements becoming sluggish and their muscles becoming weaker, since if the lungs aren't able to take in as much air, the body won't be receiving as much oxygen and that'll end up temporarily weakening them.\n\nAll of this is a logical, biological drawback to fire-breathing. And it exists in the real world, with how animals normally exhale. Taking inspiration from real life is a good idea for things like these because real life is \"balanced\". Nothing is \"op\" and nothing is stupidly underpowered. It all balances out just right"}, {"comment_author": "RevvDragon", "comment_text": "That's certainly a fair point of view, yeah!

Thanks!"}, {"comment_author": "BlackBrantScare", "comment_text": "Some random idea I got on physical weakness of dragon, this is absolutely random bullshit go btw\n\n1. Assume breathing fire is physical ability made by igniting fuel and oxidizer. Different fuel/oxidizer mix can give different flame and temperature. Fuel rich is lower temperature and made lot of soot. Oxidizer rich is high temperature, highly corrosive. Big animal usually fart methane, and if collected and compressed it is one of the strong rocket fuel in the market. Oxidizer is easier because oxygen is everywhere in the air and can be turn into liquid oxygen by mechanical compression. Both would be keep in internal organ that can hold high pressure liquid gas. Both can spray out and ignited for fire breath\n\n* however this need the dragon to hold its breath when using fire breath because hot gas go into lung is bad. It\u2019s one of main reason why people rescue from burning building die. Breathing in the hot gas, lung damage with burn scar and swelling. Which limit hiw long and how many time it can use fire breath\n\n2. heat weaken most material (jet fuel doesn\u2019t need to melt steel beam, only need to weaken it) and made most organic material pyrolysis (which is what cause burning building to explode sometimes) so a dragon would need some kind of heat protection to heat proof itself. And most of common fire proof material are made to resist/delay burning or charred like firefighter coat. And a layer of ablative material that burn away in super hot and sometimes corrosive flame like coating on soacecraft\n\n* fire proof lining inside dragon can take time to regenerate so there are limit time of it can use fire breath. And even worse if it use oxidizer rich fire breath. It could be one and done since all fire proof lining is burn away and any more fire breath can damage itself\n\n* dragon scale and armor could be weakened by the heat. Which mean easier to cut into or puncture the dragon body with weapon esp around the head where the heat is most concentrate to \n\n3. remember the gas tank organ from 1)? Imagine puncture that stuff with something sharp. Either it explode from gas expansion or blow up to piece if the leaking gas ignited like that one SpaceX rocket. And if the dragon didn\u2019t explode the leaking gas leaving the body and expanding fast it could cause frozen damage around the leaking spot\n\n4. all living being have specific operational temperature. The dragon could get overheated and get sick or need cool down period between fire breath or after fleeing from the fight. Forcing it to keep fire breathing until exhausted can make dragon seriously sick and cannot move for some time.\n\nTLDR - Dragon work like rocket.

Dragons also can't eat more than their stomach can hold, so you can't just overfeed them past their capacity to try to get them 'refueled' so to speak.\n\nFinally, if your dragon is too fat they can't fly or walk around as well, and will lead to long term health problems."}]}]
