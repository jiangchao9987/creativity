To check out the first contest, [here\u2019s our winners announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1bftnf7/official_december_solstice_2023_writing_contest/)! A few minor adjustments have been made to the format and rules of the competition, which I\u2019ll get to very soon.

The title should be in the center-top with the author's name directly below. No fancy type-setting embellishments. The only thing that should stand out is the content of your story. [Example.](https://i.imgur.com/2aPL5Ve.png)\n- Word count should be **between 2,000 and 3,000 words.**\n- The genre must be speculative fiction.

Rather than giving a numerical rating scale for each story\u2019s concept, prose, plot, and characters, judges will instead choose their top four entries and be asked to give justifications. Again, this makes the judging process much simpler. \n\nIf you're interested in being judge (and you are not planning to participate) you must be a member of our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7nu2Zz8StN), and you should DM me at @Page2000 with a request.\n\nLike last time, we will have a Reader\u2019s Choice Thread.

I originally had the thread locked to enable more unbiased reads, but several participants from the previous contest asked if there could be a way to receive feedback, and this seemed like an obvious solution that would also encourage engagement. \n\nThe awards will be as follows:\n\n- First Place: A special yellow flair.\n- Reader\u2019s Choice: A special green flair.\n- Runners-up (3): A special blue flair.\n\nIf the same author wins multiple awards, their flare color will be by order of the following priority: yellow, green, then blue.

What worked for me was basically aiming for one scene a week\n\nDuring the work week, I just think and brainstorm. During commutes or lunch breaks or while working out, basically whenever I have some spare time that I'm not working or socializing. I almost never write any of this down, just think through how I want my next scene to go and play around with different approaches in my head. Then on Saturday morning I get myself a bagel and a coffee, put on some music, and take a few hours to write out the scene. Ideally with enough planning, I can get a couple thousand words done in one morning.\n\nI almost never write during the week days. Like you mentioned, my brain is just too toast.

Only exception is if I didn't quite finish my scene on the weekend and want to put the final touches on it, or I have a strong inspiration/energy burst some random day.\n\nThen some weeks are just too busy, or I don't have any good ideas during the week, and end up not writing anything for the week.

This isn't to say you are just sitting around, waiting for a \"muse\" to hit you - actually think about it and get it done.\n\nOne of the best pieces of advice for writing I've received from Abbie Emmons on YouTube (I highly suggest her videos, no matter what skill level writer you are!) is to think about writing even when you're not really writing. Think about your characters, plot, dialogue 24/7, so that when you're actually ready to write and have the time to, you've been prepping your thoughts and mind for it. Go about your work life, daydreaming about your story - it really helped me!\n\nAlso, I work in a warehouse where I'm able to put in my earbuds and listen to music - something also that has helped my melodaptive daydreaming.\n\nWhen you actually go home, have some alone time from any distractions (whether that be other family members, friends, roommates, television, or social media), get comfy, eat something, turn your lights down, put on your headphones - get rid of any discomforts, because when you go to write that story, you need to be in a solid head space of immobility and concentration.\n\nMy favorite place to write is in my bed, when I'm laying down - not only is it the most comfortable place in my house, but laying down helps get blood circulating evenly, especially to the head, which can help thoughts flow.\n\nThis isn't a one solution fixes all scenerio.

Creativity is not always going to come after being at work all day. Whenever you feel motivated to write and have the time is fine. It will all come together eventually. I never thought I would be finished with my first novel and working on my next one, but somehow it happened. \n\nI will say that creating a dedicated space at home for writing helped a ton. I got rid of my dining room table and turned the dining area into an office. I put a colorful rope light up along with art and tapestries and other decorations. I got a nice desk for the area and attached post-it notes to it with all my different book ideas. I created a good space for being creative and it really motivated me.

That's why the kingdom is constantly scheming and plotting. In particular, they've aligned themselves with one of the big churches, which, luckily, considers that kingdom's capital to be a sacred city, and is willing to butt heads with the empire just so the city keeps its freedom. But they also allow other religions in the city, because becoming puppets to the church would be even worse, and others help counteract the church' influence. They're also doing quite well economically, so that they were able to get into some nice trade agreements \u2014 so nice, that if they are, for example, invaded by a third party, their partners would be willing to rush to their aid, and that also makes the empire wary about them.

Maybe name it after a famous wizard if religion isn't so popular, or a legendary hero. \n\nA boring answer, perhaps only relevant to your world's academic community, would just be to invent a proper clock.

I guess this depends on how many other celestial bodies are around and what the surface of the gas giant looks like.  If the gas giant is bright enough, it might make your sky quite light even during darkness (which has the added bonus of making navigation by sea difficult). We think of a \"day\" as being a full day and night, 24 hours, but there's no reason your people need to. Maybe just a day + an eclipse would be a day for them.

So it's possible that somebody smarter than me (perhaps you, perhaps somebody else in this thread) could. \n\nDifferent races, cultures, species, etc would likely have different names for it, too.

", "reply_text": "I could say \"Terry Pratchett had a very successful career!\" but that information probably isn't very useful to you, since his success doesn't really speak to the current state of the fantasy market.\n\nSo, for a more recent example, Dungeon Crawler Carl has been very successful, selling over 400,000 copies since its release in 2020.  The series (which currently stands at 6 books long) also has extremely strong sell-through; the last book in the series has ~7000 reviews on Amazon, while book 1 has ~9600 reviews, which indicates that a very high percentage of people who read book 1 go on to read the entire series.\n\nDungeon Crawler Carl exists in the LitRPG/Gamelit genre, and you could make the argument that it's more sci-fi than fantasy, but it's certainly a comedy book about a guy who fights goblins, skeletons, orcs, trolls, and other \"fantasy creatures.\"\n\nThere are also other LitRPG titles that, while not strictly speaking \"comedy\" books, do have a lighter and more irreverent tone.  For examples, see He Who Fights With Monsters, or almost anything by  Dakota Krout.\n\nI will also note that you will probably have an easier time if you can specifically write in the LitRPG genre, since this is an undeserved niche, and has an audience that clearly has an appetite for these sorts of \"irreverent\" books.  I wouldn't suggest doing this if you dislike writing LitRPG, as aside from the selfish reasons for \"you shouldn't write in a genre that you hate,\" there's a segment of readers within the LitRPG community who kind of resent  authors who are \"slumming it\" and who clearly are only writing within the genre for cynical reasons.  But if you pick up a book like Dungeon Crawler Carl or The Divine Dungeon and say \"oh yeah, I could totally write something like this,\" then that would probably be the most marketable way to go.\n\nAlternatively, you might also consider targeting another niche like \"cozy fantasy,\" as everyone has been looking for \"the next Travis Baldree\" ever since Legends and Lattes set the world on fire in 2022, and a light comedic tone might be a good fit for the sort of whimsical stories you tend to encounter in that genre, though there's not quite as much precedent for that.  (Indeed, a lot of the \"cozy fantasy\" that I might name is \"whimsical, light, and irreverent\" also exist in the genre of LitRPG, with titles like Ravens Dagger's Cinnamon Bun, or *How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps.*)"}, {"comment_text": "I have a problem.
