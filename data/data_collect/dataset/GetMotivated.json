I even offered to shoulder half the payment, but she insisted that a ''quick Google search'' will humanise her content and make it SEO friendly.\n\nClient 2 then had me create Instagram Reels and Facebook graphics using her branding and guidelines, however, every time I submitted a draft to her, she would complain: saying the fonts were unreadable, the colours don't go well etc.   \nThing is, I always test out my designs before submitting them to my clients and I followed her instructions.   \n\n\nNow both of them ended their contract with me, but this incident has made me feel inadequate.   \nI understand that these things are part of most jobs, but I've never had problems with previous clients like this.   \n\n\nWhile the company is still gracious in covering for me should the clients not pay, this has caused me some stress because it has made me fall behind my bills and other necessities.   \nI know I have to look for another job/company but I feel so anxious, insecure, and scared to start.", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "Final_Philosopher914", "comment_text": "You should focus on your strengths to become more confident.

He immediately went back to his ex-girlfriend from high school, with whom he had had a tremendously unhealthy relationship for a year when he was 17.\n\nThe decisions that other people make very often have nothing to do with us and everything to do with what they're not ready to confront in themselves.  Your ex was not ready to commit to a particular future version of himself.  That tells you nothing about your worth or value.\n\nGoing to the gym can be a great way to focus and get some positive emotional experience, but be patient with yourself, too.  What you've just gone through borders on traumatic.

Do the single most important thing - THERAPY GO TO THERAPY. Self care. Go to the gym, track your progress. Do something creative. Build your friendships."}, {"comment_author": "Gellix", "comment_text": "This is gonna be long but it kind of has to be. \n\nI\u2019ve been so depressed for so long I was begging for death multiple times throughout my life. I\u2019d been sad since I was a child. 2024 was the first year I started it off the happiest I\u2019ve ever felt. \n\nI do want to say I have no idea if this will work for others like it did me. \n\nSelf love. You have to train your brain to love yourself. Our brains learn through pattern recognition.\n\nNothing else matters. Nothing validates you but who you are and the person you want to be. That\u2019s it. Let go and forgive yourself of all your past mistakes. They don\u2019t matter, they are only going to hold you back. \n\nDo not compare yourself to anyone but your past. That\u2019s the only person you are competing with. No one else! \n\nStart by building a foundation of self love. Start getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep everyday. Eat as healthy as you can, and try to get 150 mins of exercise a week. Anything else you can think of that you want to do but may not have the energy **SELF LOVE**. You have skincare routine but you aren\u2019t feeling it well you love yourself so you should probably do it. Start setting reminders in your phone to build these good habits if you have too. \n\nJournaling everyday. Start and do it until you can see it\u2019s helping but you can\u2019t stop until you feel it\u2019s not helpful anymore. \n\nWrite about how your days went. Anything interesting in the news. Talk about how you are feeling. If you are having any kind of bad thoughts write them down and get them off your chest and out of your mind (this will help when you go to sleep). Any thoughts, anxiety, or fears right them down and break down where they are potentially coming from. \n\nThis will give you a good time line to go back and see how far you\u2019ve come. \n\nI\u2019d highly recommend therapy. It teaches you the skills to better understand and cope with your feelings. It reminds you to be kind and patient with yourself. \n\nIf a friend came to you for support you would try to relieve their stress however you could. You wouldn\u2019t pile on. You need to start doing this for yourself. \n\nAny time you have a bad thought. You need to call it out for what it is. A bad thought, that\u2019s it. I would call them out and laugh at my brain. I\u2019d call it a doomer. I would then think about all the good things in my life. It can be literally anything. I\u2019d also repeat \u201cThank you for the blessings.\u201d \n\nI use to say \u201cThank you for the blessings now and in the future.\u201d But it felt redundant after a while but it\u2019s good to have this in mind. Teach your brain to look for the positives. \n\nI kept a little knickknack for me it was my lucky rock. It could be anything. Who doesn\u2019t want a little more luck in life? Anytime something good would happen. An easy day at work, a funny coincidence, anything it was because of my lucky rock! \n\nRemember to be patient with yourself. Don\u2019t turn Wins (Ws) into Loses (Ls). Any progress is positive progress. If you make a mistake forgive yourself and try again. \n\nHave a support system. This is really important. I was having insomnia. I started to smoke weed to help me sleep. \n\nHowever, I noticed I was crying more when I would watch media while stoned. I thought that was interesting. So I started to critically think about it. Why is this happening? \n\nWell TikTok had videos that made me consider a while back I might have ADHD. So, I wondered if the marijuana was breaking through the ADHD filter and letting me emotionally connect better to stories. \n\nThis really helped me understand my brain and all these little things I\u2019ve been experiencing started to make so much more sense. \n\nI\u2019m most likely undiagnosed ADHD and high functioning autistic. Idk for sure but it just kind of makes sense with my lived experiences. \n\nAnother reason you need to have a good support system is when I\u2019d smoke. Depending on the situation I\u2019d some times get those same bad thoughts. \n\nI\u2019d critically think why I was feeling that way. I\u2019d try to break it down. Well an unfortunate side effect of being high can lead to enlightenment but it can also lead to panic attacks. That\u2019s how deep some of these fears, anxiety, and insecurities can be. In my experience all of these stem from trauma, it can even be childhood trauma. \n\nI fought through them by myself and came out better every time. They can be really intense in the moment. That\u2019s why I suggest if you start to break down these thoughts you need a support system. \n\nSomeone you can talk to and if you break down, they will be there to pick you up. Idk, if this will happen to others but I want to mention it just in case. \n\nThis is why I recommend being careful what vices you use to cope with your emotions. They might help but they can also hurt you and your progress. \n\nI started at 18 and it took me losing 100 pounds to gain the confidence to kind of be okay with myself. \n\nIt took until 25 to go to the doctor and talk about my depression and going to therapy for 8 months. \n\nIt took until 29, smoking to see I might have ADHD and understanding my brain, breaking down my fears, to find my happiness. \n\nThe beautiful part is I know I\u2019m truly happy because I gained all the weight back during the pandemic but I feel so mentally stable, confident and clear. \n\nI\u2019m slowly working on losing the weight and trying to figure what to do next. \n\nI hope this helps. You are worthy of love and happiness. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you differently, even yourself. \n\nWe can\u2019t grow and mature if life doesn\u2019t challenge us. We **won\u2019t** grow and mature if we don\u2019t challenge ourselves. \n\nTry to be as kind, patient and understanding to yourself and others. If you have any hate in your heart try your best to let it go. \n\nIf you are not sure what to do,  ask yourself what would JC do. If you are not religious, what would your favorite superhero do? Some other examples are Aang from ATLA,  Bob Ross, or Mister Roger\u2019s. \n\nFind your happiness!"}, {"comment_author": "Formal_Ferret2801", "comment_text": "You need to go back to the source of You, and try to understand your inner child more.

It\u2019s why a lot of them do fall out.

Try to set your own expectations rather than what you think others want you to do and accomplish in life. Be ok with crying.

Think of things you are grateful for, and try to find new things to be grateful for each day. Excercise (even just a walk outside). \n\nCheck how you feel after using social media, listening to news, or watching influencers, and limit your exposure or adjust what you watch if you are getting a continuous exposure of negativity. You can get addicted to following people who make you feel like a failure, feel afraid of the future, feel hatred towards everyone else, feel like the world is too messed up to fix, etc.\n\nRemember that happiness isn't a finish line to achieve once, and then everything will be easy. You will always have feelings of sadness, fear, awkwardness, stupidity, failure, etc. no matter what you do. Learning to use these experiences to learn, grow, and have more compassion for others gives us the ability to go through life, accepting that these emotions are unavoidable. \n\n*Important: All this is easier said than done! I don't think anyone is perfect at every skill and technique to find purpose, meaning, and happiness.

To challenge yourself, and to not see yourself in a soft lens , to be brutally critical of yourself and your thinking, mindset and actions , to challenge yourself to get better ! .\n\nI see it as a skill to train oneself , mostly for irrational overthinking and anxiety. \n\nThe world won't be soft to you , so brace yourself for it , it's a brutal world .\n\nHave any of you tried this ? Any tips on how to practice this , master it ? Any positive quotes relating to it ? , any encouraging words ?

In China, the phrase \"I love you\" was rarely expressed, even among family members. It was as if it was this sacred phrase, reserved only for lovers. The most I experienced were fleeting crushes on girls in school.\n\nWhen I came to America for high school, I stumbled upon a darker path. Exposure to provocative content and easy access to pornography led me down a rabbit hole of addiction and shame. Each time I indulged, I felt completely drained the next day, unable to focus or find the motivation to do what I needed to do.\n\nDuring college, I hit my lowest point. My days were consumed by playing video games, eating take-outs, and masturbating. In this darkness, I stumbled upon meditation while searching for an extracurricular class. After starting meditation, I realized the energy-draining effects of my harmful habits and understood why spiritual practitioners like monks choose asceticism.\n\nThrough meditation, I was able to release my attraction to porn. However, the habit was deeply ingrained, and I would occasionally slip back. Even though the pleasure was minimal, the pull was still there. But I was determined to overcome it and become my true self.\n\n**Finding My True Love**\n\nAs I continued my journey of self-discovery, something remarkable happened. I experienced what true love is \u2013 not the romantic love I had always yearned for, but the unconditional love of the divine, the love of my true self.\n\nWhen I got to know my true self and felt the depth of its love for me, tears would flow freely. The true self is within each of us, waiting to be united with. It's the essence of who we truly are, the fullest expression of our potential.\n\nBefore, I was a lazy person, never trying hard, even though I had the ability to become great. But after knowing my true self, after finding this love within me, I couldn't help but to try harder. I cried and longed for my true self. I decided that I would go through the pain and suffering, no matter how difficult, until the false self completely died.\n\nWith this newfound determination, I started doing everything with a renewed mindset. Waking up early, meditating diligently, exercising to the point of exhaustion \u2013 it all became a devotion to my true self. Even when the pain was excruciating, and I felt like giving up, I persisted, knowing that it was all for the sake of my true self, the one I loved so deeply.\n\nYesterday, I went on a challenging hike to the top of a mountain. The path was treacherous, and my body ached with every step. But I cried out to my true self, asking for the strength to finish. And I did, because it was no longer for me, but for the love of my true self.\n\nNever in my life have I tried so hard, but for my true self, it's all worth it.

I am so proud of that high school fuckup, though. \n\nI struggled with severe mental health issues when I was younger. It was like my brain stopped working. Putting together thoughts was difficult. My memory was shot. All I could think about was that I didn\u2019t want to live anymore. \n\nI went from being a gifted kid placed in advanced classes to failing all my classes and being truant so often that the court was going to get involved. My guidance counselor actually recommended that I drop out of school because he was so worried about my mental health. But I kept going. I didn\u2019t know if I was going to be able to graduate but I was going to try. \n\nI will never forget the feeling of having to do presentations on projects that I didn\u2019t finish because I barely had the energy to glue stuff to a piece of cardboard. The burning shame of standing in a room of smart kids who had put so much work into their projects while my failure was so evident. \n\nI knew that I wasn\u2019t going to make it academically. So, I figured out how to pivot and focus on my other strengths. I learned how to fake confidence and charm. I was depressed as hell but having come from an abusive household, one thing I knew how to do was distract people from the fact that there were problems. It is unfortunate that I had to have that skill but it saved me in the end. I was so liked by my peers that people wanted to partner with me on projects, even though they probably knew that I was more of a deficit than an asset. My teachers loved me and gave me second chances. They saw that I struggled but still put in the effort. I participated in class as best I could. They knew how badly I wanted to succeed even though I failed every time. \n\nI actually should not have been allowed to walk at my high school graduation. I still had a couple of F\u2019s. Those teachers gave me extra credit opportunities that I barely turned in on time. I\u2019m sure that one of those teachers gave me a passing grade, even though they shouldn\u2019t have. \n\nI ended up getting help for my mental health issues. I found a job that I was really difficult but I was really good at and became super successful in my career. I have won awards. I get asked to speak at conferences and be on committees. I am considered an expert in my field. \n\nI have a lot to be proud of in my career but what I am most proud of is that teenage girl who showed up to class to give a presentation that she wasn\u2019t prepared for. I\u2019m proud of the girl who felt so ashamed that she wanted to melt into the earth but still raised her hand in classes. I am more proud of the version of me who failed than the version of me who succeeded. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to keep showing up for things when you know you\u2019re going to win. But it takes guts to get back up after you have fallen. It takes humility to try something that you are bad at. It takes courage to do something that scares you. Sometimes, the most you can do is try. \n\nI encourage people to try things that they probably won\u2019t be good at. We want things in life to go well but we also need to experience having things go wrong and continuing to try. There are things that I enjoy but I\u2019m really bad at. But there is freedom when you let go of the mentality that you have to succeed. You get to be fully present instead of focusing on all the steps you need to take in order to win. You get to see where things went wrong and how you can do it differently next time. You gain more from failure than success. \n\nI love that I have been able to be successful but I\u2019m so grateful that I failed so many times along the way."}, {"comment_author": "Badwoman85", "comment_text": "I gave you a super long story but I don\u2019t know that it actually answered your question.\n\nIf you are focused on the effort instead of the outcome, you have to be present in the moment.

But I\u2019m going to try it anyways. If it doesn\u2019t work, I will look at what went wrong and try again.\u201d You aren\u2019t thinking about the end result. You are just thinking about each step as it comes. You celebrate every step of the way instead of waiting until the end. \n\nIf you fail, you don\u2019t look at it as a failure, but as a growth opportunity. Keep your eyes off the prize and on what is in front of you. \n\nA lot of people won\u2019t try something if they know they won\u2019t be good at it. They end up missing out on so many things. They miss out on finding talents that they didn\u2019t know they had. They miss out on learning how to do something better. They miss out on laughing with people about how badly something went. They miss out on seeing how much grit they have to push through something that won\u2019t reward them. \n\nWhen you play a competitive sport, someone always has to lose. If you only want to play if you can win then you will never get to play. You have to be willing to risk losing but try anyways. There will be losers who will be bitter about it but there are losers who still had fun. They are proud of the fact that they and their team went out there and gave it their all. \n\nDon\u2019t grieve losing. Be proud of the little things. All success is success. Even improving by 1% is still progress. Even if you have a setback, you still tried. It sucked but you did it anyways instead of stomping off in a huff.

I pretend that it\u2019s the baby version of me feeling hurt and rejected, and I soothe the baby (which is me).

I\u2019ll add a few things as I just went through a tough breakup: \n\n1. You shouldn\u2019t fret over someone who doesn\u2019t want you - why waste your emotional energy on someone who wouldn\u2019t do the same for you? You\u2019re better than that. Value yourself first, and look at it as if people who don\u2019t want you don\u2019t deserve you. This is assuming you weren\u2019t a toxic partner; if that is the case, you probably know and have some anxiety about that - talk to a therapist and work on being healthier in your relationships. \n\n2. The most attractive thing you can do is prioritize yourself. I don\u2019t mean that as \u201cbe as selfish / narcissistic as possible\u201d but rather: pursue your own interests, and take care of yourself. Essentially, treat yourself like the person you are trying to impress. Demonstrate to yourself that you are worth it, and others will take notice. Focus on healthy / happy habits and living, and in time you\u2019ll attract more people - then you just have to choose one with similar values.\n\n3.

I didn't think we were that serious but it was probably my only chance to get out of a dead Southern town and experience life, so I said WTH.\n\nLong story short, he was a man whore. He'd lured me there with promises of marriage and kids.

Now I was thousands of miles from friends and family and all on my own. \n\nHow did I get over this shit hole? At first I was depressed and angry  at myself for believing his bullshit. I was just starting to realize how he'd destroyed my self esteem. I felt unattractive and unlovable. \n\nI was sinking into a deep depression and losing sleep due to anxiety about my future.\n\nI realized that I had to expel these feelings from my body before they consumed me. \n\nFor the first time in my life, I signed up for a 24 hour gym.

Keep casting lines out for men who might be just what you're looking for but use this recent experience as a lesson to take early promises with a grain or two of salt.

While \u201cyou\u2019re fine the way you are\u201d is good to help you feel good, and you should feel good about yourself, it\u2019s not advice. \n\nIn my experience as a man, and understanding  men in general (won\u2019t apply to every man as everyone has different preferences) men are attracted to \u201cfemininity\u201c. Yes I know that\u2019s very vague and femininity and masculinity are fluid terms but I\u2019ll try to outline what I mean with some examples of traits below that men (generally speaking) look for in a female partner in order of priority: \n\n**1. Physical appearance**\n- Men are visual creatures, and they want someone they are physically attracted to\n- *Relatively* slim physique, but more so enough slimness to show feminine curves (this means lots of variance!)\n- if you\u2019re considered \u201coverweight\u201d, def work on trying to slim down a bit - its great to see you go to the gym and eat healthy! (controversial, i know, but this is just how most men i know operate)\n- Nice hair, clothes that show off your feminine figure (not being overtly sexual and revealing, although it can work but maybe more so for guys looking for a one night stand), and not *too* much makeup where you can see the layers of foundation\n- good hygiene (probably goes without saying lol) \n\n**2. Warmth**\n- broad term but includes being just generally kind, supportive, empathetic, nurturing and non-combative\n- contrary to what many may think, men don\u2019t really like to be challenged all the time. Yes in a flirty way, but not in a way where he has to constantly be vying for your attention etc\n- being receptive to his humor is a big one! I love making my partner laugh, it makes me happy that I\u2019m making her laugh and be happy, and makes me feel more connected with her \n- give him room to lead and support his decision making (within reason. if he wants to fight someone for no reason, don\u2019t support that - major red flag hahaha) \n- showing appreciation - men like to see their efforts mean something to their partner and this will go a long way\n\n**3. Integrity** \n- again, very broad term, but more along the lines of strong morals specifically demonstrating loyalty, being accountable for your actions and self awareness\n- for me personally, what i love about my partner is she has strong family values and prioritizes it. This is very attractive to me. \n\nAnd honestly that\u2019s it. \n\n\nThere\u2019s also some things that you should know that men generally don\u2019t care that much about, like how much money you make, or that you\u2019re highly educated, or that you work a lot and are ambitious. While these are great things, they\u2019re not something that\u2019s going to emphasize your attractiveness. So it\u2019s fine to mention it, but don\u2019t think that these are things that attract men in general. (Again, everyone is different and some men really do value these things, most men in my experience don\u2019t prioritize them, especially against the 3 traits listed above). \n\nFinally don\u2019t constantly talk about or brag about your sexual history (i think this can go for both men and women). No future partner wants to think about their current partner or prospective partner being sexual with someone else. \n\nDating in your 30s is hard and rejection is hard to deal with. The best way to deal with it, is by getting used to rejection and understanding what went wrong and changing your strategy (within reason and without losing yourself in the process) but more importantly also understanding that this person that rejected you also might not have been a good fit for you anyways! **Being rejected is not a reflection of your self worth!** \n\nGood luck and I hope this helps."}, {"comment_author": "None", "comment_text": "[removed]"}, {"comment_author": "AutoModerator", "comment_text": "Your submission was automatically removed because it includes bigotry and/or hate speech.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm not saying any of this would have happened to you, but the grass ain't always greener.\n\nFirst off, I'm very sorry that you're going through this. It hurts, it sucks, and it's just all around devastating.\n\nWhat I have to say may seem like cold comfort, as it certainly was to me, but I will also go into some personal experiences that made me understand why people give advice like this. It's better to have a relationship end than it is to stay in a relationship that's not fulfilling.\n\nIn the beginning, your ex probably was sincere and shared the same goals and desires. However, the idea and the reality are often very different, and they may have realized that it's not what they wanted. It's possible they still have those goals, but they came to believe that you weren't the right person.\n\nAs for my personal experience, over ten years ago, I fell in love with someone who reciprocated. I truly believed that I had found my soul mate, even though it was a long-distance relationship. We were together for about three years, and we started to discuss some really serious shit like marriage. Then, seemingly out of the blue, she told me \"We need to talk.\" After we talked, the relationship was done, and I was beside myself. I was hurt, I was angry, and I was very confused. I spent weeks reflecting and trying to figure out what went wrong and what I did wrong.\n\nWell, a realization hit me after a while, and I came to the conclusion that she made the right choice. We had a lot in common, too much in common, actually. We both had some personal roadblocks that made continuing the relationship very difficult, even if we were both happy at the time. Our discussion about marriage got her thinking, and she realized that we were making plans that neither of us were going to be able to make a reality. We needed something different. \n\nAfter realizing this, I reached out and talked to her. We both still trusted each other, and neither of us said anything cruel to the other, so things were amicable. You know that whole cliche about getting friend-zoned? That's what we ended up agreeing to. We're still very close friends to this day. I'm still single, but she's married now. Her husband is different from me in ways that she really needs. And yeah, it did hurt when she started seeing someone and that relationship developed and grew, while I couldn't maintain a lasting romance with anyone else. I was lonely for the longest time and started to get bitter.\n\nStrap in, because here's where things go batshit!\n\nWhat did not help with the loneliness was most of my other friends and family were getting married, starting families, and all of that. For a time, for all of them, things were good. One of my younger cousins, who was in his mid-twenties at this point, rushed into a relationship and was drunk off dopamine. He put the \"dope\" in dopamine. It did not take his girlfriend long to start seeing red flags, and his behavior reminded me of myself at times. So his girlfriend ended the relationship, and my cousin was devastated like I was. \n\nI don't think it was even a month before he was dating someone else. About a month later, he proposed. I had some reservations because of...everything, but I was supportive. Red flags from both of them started popping up. It got so bad that my family started to suspect she was actually vandalizing my cousin's property over a petty perceived slight. It was confirmed, however, that she had not been the one to vandalize his car, thanks to the apartment complex's security cameras, so the family dropped the matter and the day of the wedding came and went.\n\nI had misgivings, but every time I asked or brought it up to others, they dismissed my concerns and their behavior as \"pre-wedding jitters\". Almost immediately after the wedding, EVERYBODY saw serious signs of abuse being suffered by my cousin. His wife threw things at him when she was upset, took complete control of the finances, and if he upset her bad enough, she would leave without notice for days and leave him without access to food (aside from family), ways to feed and care for their dogs, and other essentials. Within five months of the wedding, the family was finally acknowledging that things were bad, and that's when she started to accuse him of abuse, made threats of suicide, etc.\n\nThey separated, and the entire legal was one of the most horrific things I ever saw. My cousin had to get a lawyer and get proactive in documenting his activity because of how frequently his ex called the police to accuse him of stalking, harassment, vandalism, etc., because the cops showed up to his home a workplace ready to arrest him until his employer verified his presence during the alleged incidents. Meanwhile, she was doing everything she accused him of. The cops did nothing, and my cousin had enough and moved out of state.\n\nThat's just one of my friends/family. Another friend got married to a woman with a family full of drug addicts that resulted in their divorce. Another friend got married to his partner of over ten years and had twins. His wife was diligent and encouraged him to take a fulfilling and high-paying job that he enjoyed. One day, he got a concerned call from their children's daycare as his wife had failed to pick up their children and was not answering their calls. He called her and when she answered, she gave a cryptic response that alarmed him. He had to leave work and pick up their kids and was greeted at their home to a \"Dear John\" Letter saying that she had been fucking another guy and had run away to Europe with him because she realized she didn't actually want to settle down and have a family, even though most of that had been her idea to begin with.\n\nI've stopped dating, I've stopped flirting with women, and I don't view long-term relationships and marriage as a goal. \n\nI put the tl;dr at the top, but to get to the point, as much as you're hurting right now, it's better to let it end and focus on yourself and make life more fulfilling for you personally. Explore some hobbies, take vacations, and try new things!\n\nIf you need someone to talk to, you can hit me with a DM."}, {"comment_author": "Guses", "comment_text": "9 months ago (while in this new relationship?) you were still down because of your previous ex dumping you 2 years prior.

I still watch occasionally but i try to keep the subject matter within the bounds of reality, so to speak, and try to limit it to like once maybe twice a week. I jerk off every night i cant fall asleep without doing it lol but i stopped regularly watching porn every time.\n\nI had a bad habit of watching porn (like twice daily if not more) seeking out my specific interest (butt stuff) and after a decade it finally started to affect my intimate moments with women. As soon as i realized what was happening I made some efforts to change for the better.\n\nI still jerk off like 3 or 4 times a day, I cant help it, I have an insatiable, voracious libido.

Its a huge inconvenience actually, and im tired of it. But for my mental health and to make sure I can rise to the occasion I am much more careful about what content i watch, for how long, etc.\n\nOne thing i want to point out for OP, your brain responds to things like placebos very strongly. If you know what you are watching is nasty, if you feel guilty or disgusting when you are finished, it is far more likely to do damage to your psyche. If you instead just appreciate the female figure without watching hardcore or fetishy porn, and dont feel guilty or disgusted with yourself when its over, you will feel much better about yourself. Its just \"me time\" there is nothing wrong with it, and you are a human being who has valid needs wants and desires. No shame in that unless you overindulge like a glutton.\n\nTheres boatloads of studies which you can draw conclusions from on this topic of placebo and how your brain effects your body- in one study i recall, two people eat the same meal, the control just has dinner without being bothered but the other subject is exposed to gross smells or audio of someone puking, that person is much more likely to experience digestive/intestinal distress from an identical meal to the control... Your mind effects your body and your body effects your mind. Same can be said for porn and it should be consumed not only in moderation but also the subject matter should be carefully chosen. Do not let your fantasies get out of hand, if you watch too much crazy stuff and dont hold back, your interests will continue to escalate until normal interactions with even the hottest of women will not be enough.

Downloading a habit tracker app can help you keep a record of when you did it. Allocate specific days of the week and say that you will only do it on those days. It might even be 6 days a week at first, but once you start to see your progress, that will help to motivate you to continue cutting down further and further.\n\n2) Replace it with another habit. You've built a routine up for this habit, so try to switch it out for something that's healthier and will give you a boost of pride. Do some push ups, drink a glass of water, try some guided meditation or download a language learning app. Whatever it is that you decide to do, consistency is key. Before long you'll have built a new, healthier habit into your routine.\n\n3) Change your room. Your brain associates your bed with the dopamine hit from masturbating, so if you can, you could do something to change this cue: getting a new mattress or blanket, or moving your bed to a different place in your room for example. \n\n4) Join a community. You're not alone, there are loads of others on the same journey as you, so don't be afraid to keep asking for help or motivation. Ask as many times as you need, or find a buddy that you can regularly check in with.\n\nYou will probably stumble, but that's okay! You're literally rewiring your brain, so it'll take time.

The brain is no different. \n\nI say all this to hopefully help remove ideas like you have no will power or something like that. Your brain is expecting something and then does its best to get that reward. Changing this is slow process but very very doable and isnt that different from learning a skill like an instrument or sport. As someone said start slow, get one night a week where you break that routine, do whatever you need to in order to break it once a week, maybe choose a specific day or something but do your best to hit that one day.

You will find that, while it may initially seem difficult, like your body is gagging for just a few breadcrumb, there's actually not much that you, body and mind, can't get accustomed to and still work without, and your mind will quickly fill any \"void\" with new habits.

Because digestion is a humongous task your body does, it requires a lot of energy. This can directly affect your sleep, which in turn affects how dull or fresh you feel in the morning. Here are 3 tips that will make it easier for you to wake up in the morning. \n\nChew your food. Sounds simple, but it isn\u2019t. Our digestion process starts from our mouth itself, where the digestive enzymes in our saliva are supposed to break our food down, and our stomach is expecting this half digested food. This way, the energy required by our stomach for digestion will be significantly less. But let\u2019s face it, most of us don\u2019t chew enough, and this is why this is the very first tip. \n\nDon\u2019t stuff yourself with food. This is plain and simple - if you\u2019re overeating, your stomach hates you for making it work overtime! Don\u2019t starve yourself obviously, but also don\u2019t eat like a pig! Interestingly enough, chewing your food well will naturally make sure you don\u2019t eat too much, because we only have so much patience to chew so much food, right?  \n\nDon\u2019t Sleep Right After You Eat. You will observe that our body becomes dull right after we eat. So it may make sense to make use of that dullness and sleep right away. Well, not if you want to get up feeling fresh in the morning! If you keep sufficient gap, where this temporary dullness caused by food has subsided, and then sleep, you will see you will feel much more fresh in the morning when your alarm rings. So have a gap of around 2 hours between dinner and sleep. \n\nMy experience with these tips : So I heard about these tips from Sadhguru last week, and after giving it some thought I was like \u201cwhy not?\u201d. I decided I\u2019ll do it for a week. I'm still baffled to say that I woke up at 5, four times this week! It\u2019s a pretty huge deal for me! I won\u2019t lie though, it feels weird, because I am used to going to bed feeling absolutely dull and sleey. But I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m able to experience that morning high again!

If you get $30k at launch, $1k the month after, $3.5k the next month and maybe $200 every month after that it becomes hard to manage the financial side of your life.

I make a good living now doing something that I am passionate about and I would be glad to give you my perspective. You are saying a lot of the things that I was when I was 17. \n\nAt 17 I was self taught in computers, hardware and software. This was when the internet was brand new, 1994'ish. I spent every waking moment either in high school, or at home learning computers. I learned much more at home than I did in school, but that diploma was a necessary piece of paper for the rest of my life. This was before youtube or even cell phones. I learned from books I found in the library or from other people whom I met in real life. \n\nI worked at Sonic drive in for 3.25/hr. It was terrible. I hated the smell of it, and the people that worked there were not pursuing the types of goals I was. A friend helped me change jobs to a local grocery store where I worked for a couple of years, paying the bills. \n\nThis is something I want to stress to you. First off, you have to pay your bills. This means making money in some kind of way... right now. This is not about dreams or passions, you are not there yet. This is about starting to become financially independant, which is a process you have not expereienced yet, and you have no skills in. While you are making money, be working on improving your situation and finding your goals and what steps you need to take to get there. \n\nYou mention \"programming, video editing, graphics design\" as a way to make money. These are all long term goals and it will take you years, possibly a decade to develop the skills and reputation to get paid to do these things. You have access to technology now that I never did which allows you to do all of those things for free. Take advantage of it. But realize you will be doing it on your own time, for free. Because you are passionate about it. \n\nPrograming... it's hard. The only way to really learn it is to pick a project right now and start working on it. Keep working on it and making it better. Set aside a certain amount of time every day and actually work on your project. Be focused. You will learn quickly and it will be very, very hard. Eventually with enough work you can get over the hump and things will come easier. \n\nMy first job like this was after the grocery job. I met some friends that were as into computers as I was. We hung out all the time, learning together. One of them had a connection to someone that wanted to invest in Web Designer. I was cheap and I had some obvious skills, so he took a chance on me. It hardly paid anything at all. I was terrible at it. I did not have the skills or the self discipline yet to aquire them as I needed them. While I was there though... remember what I said about improving your situation?  I was able to network with more computer guys and they taught me so much about hardware. I was now able to run networks and troubleshoot. \n\nWhich led me to my next job, in Austin with a major company doing phone support. It paid pretty good. Got married. Spent a bunch of money on things like a house, cool car... and then 2001 happened. The job was gone and I was in real trouble. There were no more computer jobs for me all the sudden. \n\nWhich leads me to my next point... Remember when I said you have to pay the bills? I took a job as a mechanic because I can troubleshoot. It did not pay much, but it paid the bills. We lost the house and the cars, and the wife got cancer and lost her leg.\n\nListen... life is frigging tough and when you are on your own everything is not handed to you. And sometimes things are not fair.  I had to work twice as hard now to support both of us.  She ended up getting pregnant and we had fully gone into default on the house now, we had to move to a different state to survive. \n\nAll of this time I'm not doing my dream job let me tell you. Working in a shop in the heat is hard work. \n\nI found the only computer job in Arkansas and it was an easy job that paid the bills but it was basically data center baby sitting. I was bored. \n\nI then decided to follow a dream, which was to be a police officer. It was a wild change and experience and I don't regret it. It's a steady job but extremely stressfull. I could write a book on it to be honest. After 20 years of that and changing states again (to again improve my station). I now make good money, doing somthing that I get fulfillment from.  Guess who is the office IT guy? lol. I occasionally get to help someone with a spreadsheet formula, and I still program sometimes for fun, but it's a use it or loose it skill. I'm not a good programer, but I am genuinely happy at home with my family. \n\nHopefully this gives you some perspecitve and helps in some way.

I have 4 or  5 friends that are game devs and only one of them is happy with the work environment.

Then there's a sliver of absolutely bonkers, driven people who lack survival drive and are taking any risk that's possible to take - not as a calculated risk mind you. They just can't help themselves.\n\nThen of those, a very, very, tiny fraction survives AND lucks into the right conditions to turn into what then the others around  will build up to be \"a great man\" like Steve Jobs or whatever. Consider all the mythos is people like you who build that up because they want to believe in it, they need it for inspiration. The Steve Jobs-like person don't give a shit. Others like popstars or politicians are experts at exploiting that need in people to believe in someone great(er), and creating their persona.\n\nFinally, there's all those with rich parents, and hobby people with money, who don't necessarily share any of the drive of the other set. But boy will they definitely compete with the first set for those little \"artist slots\" in society, all the while pretending like privilege had  nothing to do with it.\n\nShould you happen to belong to set A) then god help you.  If you can, then lean on the survival part of the skill set, as your drive will break through anyway, no matter what.  \nNo matter where you are on the creativity-darwin-yourself-spectrum, I would recommend to focus on learning how to create a creative discipline.  Passion will always be unreliable. Everything is fucking unreliable. The real work only comes from having a habit of well, doing the work. That goes double if you think, can you still do it after a shit day of job work? Once you have family? When you need to do all that adulting?"}, {"comment_author": "KnightGamer724", "comment_text": ">don't get me wrong; they do give me a relatively good amount of freedom and i'm grateful to them for that, but i still don't have full control and often find myself constrained by their decisions  \n  \nI get that, I was in a similar boat until I moved out after marrying my wife. Now, my relationship with my parents is a lot better. They recognize that I am an adult, I somewhat know what I'm doing, and while I'm making different choices than what they would have done, I have my own objectives, and I'm reaching for them. I'm hoping something similar happens with you.\n\nI'm going to point you to [Pirate Software](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/YEjIiQNQhvs), who has a good quote on this. Basically, you want to be financially independent first before doing your passion full time. It sucks, but that's the way it is. So I'd find a job that can help you progress and move forward on that, but still fuel your creativity in some way. For instance, I'm a night janitor at a local university, which means I have a ton of time just cleaning the same desks, tables, and toliets every night. So I queue up shows and YouTube videos to watch while doing that, and I carry a notepad or laptop that I set up to write down notes as I come up with ideas for novels and other projects as I work. \n\nMy passion is storytelling. Whether it's novels, videos, or video game RPGs, that's what I want to be doing. But right now, I'm not in a position to sustain my wife and myself doing that. But I'm still chipping away at it, and that helps me emotionally recharge for my job. \n\nRemember, the second your passion is your job, that means it's your job. My dad is an artist, but he used to be a marketing art director. When he was in that position, he would do all sorts of fun drawings on the side at home because he wasn't doing art in his main job. Now he's a contract artist, which means he doesn't do those illustrations anymore because why would he spend another two hours on a He-Man drawing for fun when he just spent the whole day doing contract illustrations? Now, he does outside work, takes care of my sisters who are still at home, and on a rare occasion, takes commissions from an old friend for art on a figure series he's invested in. \n\nYou seem like a good kid, you are already looking forward and trying to figure out your path in life. That's excellent. While I'm not that much older than you, I remember being 17 and wanting to go all in on my passions as well. Keep that fire burning, but don't let it take the field. Harness it, bridle it, and you'll be shooting for the stars soon enough. \n\nTL;DR Get a job that'll pay the bills first, do the game development stuff on the side."}, {"comment_author": "Jujitsu_Master6", "comment_text": "I assure you its possible to go to Uni, get a job, and develop a game on your weekends. A project like that should take years (if you rush it, you'll ruin it - both your personal enjoyment of developing it and the actual quality of the game). Financial buffers give your brain a sense of more creative freedom because you won't have a nervous breakdown feeling like its game or bust. Gives you leeway if there's problems with the game's marketability. Plus, if you can learn to be emotionally independent of what you do for a living (enjoy both a day job and your side-projects) it's a win-win. Anything is possible if you're willing to take the long view."}, {"comment_author": "inkihh", "comment_text": "Did you talk to your parents in this depth?"}, {"comment_author": "GreenGrass4892", "comment_text": "Not one period or capital \"I\" in the entire post.
