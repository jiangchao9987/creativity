You're going from Software engineering to IT. Sounds like you like computers / coding. If you really do, go onto Udemy and pick a course in coding.

There are jobs out there which will hire you on skill. As the years go on and you mature, you'll find that going back to uni and completing a degree will be easier. I was unable to pass uni until 28. I Just was not mature enough to have discipline with studying.   \n\n\nLastly, to hit that final 50% of external motivation, go make friends and surround yourself with people who do what you like to do.

This is important: there is nothing so small that you can't be proud of yourself for it, especially when you're depressed. The ONLY person you need to compare yourself to is who you were the day before. If you were struggling to take care of yourself for a while, then you should recognize when you do something good like brush your teeth, for example, if it was something you weren't doing before. Keep doing this every day, and then see if you can start recognizing the good things you're doing the moment you actually do them. Being proud of yourself can really help to start an upward spiral.\n\nAlso, I recommend therapy for pretty much everyone.

Am I just cold and jaded now? Will I never be happy again?\u201d \n\nNow it\u2019s easier to recognize that depressive periods come and go. And when I\u2019m in them my thoughts are distorted and I don\u2019t have motivation. And that\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t beat yourself up for it, don\u2019t panic about it, don\u2019t try to force yourself out of it. Just be gentle with yourself and care for your base needs. Drink water, eat food, be extra kind to yourself, and know that it will pass. You don\u2019t have to feel bad about feeling bad.\n\nAnd if it doesn\u2019t pass on its own, know that help is available. If you can afford therapy, it\u2019s a great option and can be very effective in learning to manage these thoughts and feelings when they appear.

Here are some things that helped me and that I hope help you.\n\n1. I didn't feel happy while I was coasting either because I felt my time could be better spent elsewhere. So that's exactly what I did: I spent my time in places that I thought were meaningful. Physical health, emotional and mental health, making art, work, stuff like that. It doesn't mean that I don't have to do bullshit I don't wanna, but at least that bullshit is interspersed with stuff I DO care about anf the bullshit lets me do the stuff I care about. An additional benefit of this is that the stuff you care about will probably naturally lead you to make goals, which will help even more. It's a positive feedback loop; you just gotta start. E.g. why did you choose a bio and env sci programs? I'm guessing it was cuz you thought it was a worthwhile use of your time on this Earth to care about life. How can you actually do that? Maybe volunteer, maybe write and share a poen about nature, maybe make some amazing, low-impact food you can make for yourself and friends. Lots of choices here.\n\n2. Relates to the thing above but make sure you're taking care of yourself. We are monkeys on a rock, no matter how many quantum supercomputers and gene editing techniqued we design.

I was crazy depressed during this time and had undiagnosed and untreated ADHD my entire life. Getting help was amazing.

Just like entering the world of fashion, this is a daunting quest for me. I've always been fascinated with how people can dare to fly a plane. Are they superhuman?? I'll find out in a couple of weeks. Of course I'll just be a passenger for most of it, but apparently the teacher will let you take control for a bit. Wish me luck haha.\n* This week I've felt that I'm fully back in my studying groove. I'm still technically behind on a course, but I will get to it in due time. I'm just happy I didn't give up even though I'm struggling.\n* This week I finished a book called \"Deep Work\" by Cal Newport (a book/author I'm sure you've heard of). I enjoyed it enough to make sure to extract everything I got out of it and put it down on paper. I'm hoping I can systematically implement the ideas I captured in my notebook into my life. The notion of practicing focus is not a novel concept, but it sure could be executed better by most of us. I look forward to reading more of Newport's work, and I've also garnered a desire to read more specifically about polymaths and how they manage their time/interests.\n* I've been running a lot, but also realizing how nice a walk could be for thinking (inspired by the book!). I've also grown tired of fasted morning runs that make me bonk out at a third of my actual endurance potential \ud83d\ude43 So this coming week I'll be switching it up and going for a brisk morning walk, and then squeezing in a run every other evening at minimum. Should be a lot more enjoyable.\n\n# The bad:\n\n* I didn't lift at all this week. I did complete some maintenance workouts with planks & push-ups, but I've just not found the time to focus on more training in between this crazy school schedule I have at the moment. At the same time, I'd hate to lose the little bit of muscle I've gained so far. Even though running is easier to motivate because I also get out of the house, I will try to do better next week.\n* I experienced a high amount of stress and anxiety. It's kind of inevitable when you feel overwhelmed by the work on your plate every day. Not much to do about it right now except hold out until summer break\n* I snoozed a lot, which I think might be a symptom of all the stress and just wanting to sleep more. Again, not much I can do about it right now. I just have to keep going to sleep on time and hoping that my body can recover enough to support the high-intensity period I'm currently in.\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nIn the spirit of Deep Work, I'll be using time-blocking to schedule all of next week. At least for the work day---the book also suggests scheduling what to do for your leisure time, which feels like more than I can chew at the moment. I'll just be focusing on making sure I always know what to do and that I'm not being distracted by cheap dopamine.\n\nI'll be reflecting more on what I can implement to start taking better control of my life, so I may be able to enjoy some recreational activities and not burn out. You can't change your life overnight, but I do think books like Deep Work provide good frameworks if you take the time to actually use what you've learned.

It sounds like you're really tough on yourself, but it's important to recognize the effort you're putting in, even when the outcomes aren't what you hoped for. Job searching is particularly challenging and can take a toll on anyone's mental health and self-esteem.\n\nFirstly, try to remember that comparing ourselves to others often gives a skewed perception of their reality. Everyone moves at their own pace, and it\u2019s perfectly okay to be in a different place than your peers.\n\nTo help break out of this rut:\n- **Shift your focus:** Instead of measuring success by job offers or relationship status, try to find value in personal growth and the small victories each day brings. Did you learn something new today? Did you make someone smile? These count.\n- **Set small, achievable goals:** Breaking your larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks can help build a sense of accomplishment and can gradually lead you towards where you want to be.\n- **Network and seek feedback:** Sometimes, getting into a new job requires a bit of networking. Reach out to professionals in your field on LinkedIn for informational interviews. Also, if possible, ask for feedback on your job applications or resume from mentors or professionals in the industry.\n- **Seek support:** Talk to friends or family about how you're feeling. Sometimes, just voicing your struggles can lighten your load. If you\u2019re able, speaking to a therapist or counselor can provide tools to manage your feelings of depression and lack of motivation.\n- **Find what inspires you:** Whether it\u2019s a hobby, exercise, or learning a new skill, find something that brings you joy and dedicate some time to it regularly. It can help shift your focus from what you feel you're lacking to what you're capable of creating or achieving.\n\nLastly, it\u2019s okay to not have everything figured out at 23. Many people don\u2019t have their lives fully on track at that age, despite what it may seem. Life is a journey with ups and downs, and it\u2019s full of changes.

Relationships have their own timeline. I know plenty of people who were in great relationships at your age who are picking up the pieces after their divorce now. I know others who are just getting into their first long-term relationship ever. \n\nCareers are the same way. A good friend of mine took a gamble on a new career in his late 30s and is now going back to school to go back to his previous choice in his 40s. \n\nI'll also say a few months in a rut is just super normal, and it's going to be part of your life.

Even a weekend road trip can shake your mind up and give your perspective. \n\nIf you aren't getting interviews, then you need to look at your resume. That is what gets you in the door. Really read the job descriptions and add keywords from the description to your resume and tailor it to the job. Even rearranging the order of things to match is a strong move. Along those lines, look and see if there is a class, skill, or certification you can knock out on these job descriptions. There may be some minimum requirement that you don't meet that you're missing. \n\nThe best relationship advice I can offer is to just focus on improving yourself and finding passions in life. The more things you are passionate about, the more likely you are to find someone to be passionate about those things with. Over the long run, those shares interests and experiences will be what help you and your partner to grow closer together rather than further apart. \n\nNow that you are a real life grown up you need to remember that life is a journey, pace yourself, try to learn patience, some of the greatest things I've done in my life have taken years to build up to.

The journey from where you are to where you want to be starts with acknowledging your feelings but not letting them define you. Your value isn\u2019t determined by your job title or the success of your business but by the qualities you bring to what you do and the lives you touch along the way.\n\nStarting your own business and contemplating a YouTube channel or podcast are signs of a proactive and creative spirit\u2014qualities that are invaluable and can lead to fulfillment and success, though perhaps not always in the ways we initially envision. These ventures matter, as they reflect your initiative to shape your life and contribute to others'.\n\nConsidering further education or volunteer opportunities are both excellent ideas. Sometimes, the right volunteer opportunity takes time to find but keep looking, as it can be a rewarding way to gain experience, meet new people, and contribute to your community.\n\nIn terms of making yourself more marketable, reflect on the skills you enjoy using most and consider how they might align with different roles or industries. Networking, both online and in person, can also be a powerful tool. Reaching out to professionals in fields you\u2019re interested in, attending workshops or webinars, and joining relevant online communities can provide insights and open doors to opportunities you might not have considered.\n\nLastly, it may help to break down your larger dream into smaller, achievable goals. What steps can you take this month, or even this week, that will bring you closer to your vision? Celebrate each small victory along the way\u2014progress isn\u2019t always linear, and every step forward is significant.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s okay to seek support during this time. Whether it\u2019s from friends, family, or a professional, talking about your experiences can provide comfort and clarity.\n\nYour path may not look exactly how you imagined at 26, and that\u2019s okay.
