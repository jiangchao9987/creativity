Clothes dirty, messy workspace, it\u2019s as if the physical matches what I was feeling internally.\n\nI felt terrible so I wouldn\u2019t take care of myself or my environment.\n\nThe environment didn\u2019t allow me to change so I felt terrible.\n\nIt was like an endless loop that dug me further and further down a hole.\n\nWhen I looked in the mirror, I saw someone who couldn\u2019t even take care of their hygiene or their messy room. What life changes was I going to make?\n\nSo, I took it slow.\n\nI cleaned my room. Then I cleaned my desk. I did my laundry. I took care of my hygiene. I got some new clothes.  \nAnd guess what?\n\nAfter months of rock bottom, I felt like I could change.\n\n# Step 2: Lessen the Screen Usage\n\nOn average, my screen time during that time was 11-13 hours a day. It consisted of watching movies I\u2019ve already watched, scrolling through endless social media, and revisiting the same 4-5 websites over and over again.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to improve my life so I scrolled. When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months. (still going)\n\nMeditation for nine months. (still continuing)\n\nNever in a million years did I think that I would be the type of person to use Therapy, but it\u2019s been an integral part of my growth overall as a person.\n\nI\u2019ve cut the things that haven\u2019t worked and worked ruthlessly on the things that have had a big impact on my life.\n\n# Step 4: Figure out what you want\n\nI was starting to get my life back together. But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life. Any book, article, or video on self-improvement that I could find was combined to these three things.\n\nThe first one being that there were only a few areas of my life that I really cared about.\n\nRelationships\n\nFun\n\nCareer\n\nFinances\n\nAnd Health\n\nI set two goals for each area of my life, one being a ceiling goal and the other being a floor goal.\n\nThe ceiling goal being the ambitious goal that I would be excited to hit.\n\nThe floor goal being the bare minimum that I was looking to hit.\n\nThis gave me a buffer between the two and helped me manage my expectations when working towards my goals as a person.\n\nThen came the last idea.\n\nI used to set really big goals until I was constantly disappointed. So, I started to focus on the input and not the output.\n\n# Step 5: Building your Schedule\n\nYou want to know what makes a good life? Good years.\n\nA good year is made from good months.\n\nA good month is made from good weeks.\n\nA good week is made from good days.\n\nYou get my point. I now had everything in place to start to put everything into practice.\n\nI think it was best summed up here: Your life is made up of a series of ordinary Tuesdays. Figure out what your ideal normal Tuesday looks like. Because if you can have an amazing Tuesday, you\u2019ll probably have an amazing life. (Tim Ferriss, I believe)\n\nOf course, life has glorious ups and downs but that\u2019s maybe 10% of your life. I wanted to optimize for my own regular Tuesday, so this is currently the day I try to live every single day.\n\n8-8:30 am - Morning Routine  \n8:30- 10:30 am - Work  \n10:30-11 am - Meditate and Drive to the Gym  \n11-12:30 pm - Gym  \n12:30-1:30 pm - Lunch  \n1:30-3:30 pm - Work  \n3:30-4 pm - Eat a Snack  \n4-6 pm - Work  \n6-8 pm - Hangout with Friends / Family Dinner  \n8-10 pm - Hobbies  \n10-11 pm Wrap up Work  \n11-12 pm Night Routine\n\n# Step 6: Doing what you\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to do\n\nDespite being the biggest part of the entire 100 days, this was the easiest part to continue.\n\nI knew what I had to do, when I had to do it, and why I was doing it.\n\nThere was no confusion in my mind so everything just kind of became automatic for me.\n\nThis is easily the most important part of the 100 days. You see, everything before this was just preparing and getting in the right headspace to finally tackle the goals that I said that I would.\n\nWhenever I said that I would do something and I didn\u2019t do it. It stopped any momentum of progress that I had and made me lose trust in myself.\n\nI would then be consistent with my schedule for a couple of weeks then mess it up. This cycle happened over and over again.\n\nI became confident in my abilities by doing the things over and over again.\n\nI was building evidence in the type of person that I wanted to become. And that evidence came through setting goals. Achieving them. Setting goals. Achieving them.\n\nThere came a certain level of confidence when I said I would do something and I actually did it.\n\nSomething similar that I learned from therapy was despite having all of these grand ambitions, I could still be a friend to myself.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t treat anyone else as harshly as the way I treated myself. I thought it made me better, but it didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I criticized myself, I quit things quicker, felt the lows worse, and just felt a net negative to my overall life.\n\nWhen I treated myself better, I gave myself more opportunities, I spent longer on projects, and felt way better during the entire process.\n\nDo what you say you\u2019re going to do, but be nice to yourself in the process.\n\n# Step 7: Consistency over Everything\n\nAt this point, I could finally look at myself in the mirror. My health still wasn\u2019t 100% but it was through the habits that I was getting better.\n\nI could guarantee failure by quitting but being consistent was the only chance I had at success.\n\nI\u2019ve known this advice quite early, but I wish I could have followed it better.\n\nI always thought intensity could outwork consistency but I\u2019ve been wrong every single time.\n\nIt was actually taking walks that helped me out of that rock bottom.\n\nWhen I was nauseous and couldn\u2019t physically do anything else in the day, it was a promise to myself that I would walk for a minute outside.\n\nThat minute turned to five.\n\nThen to ten.\n\nThen to twenty.\n\nIt was the small promise to myself every single day that no matter how sick I felt, I would go for a walk.\n\nAnd it was the one habit that helped me pick myself up piece by piece to every other step of these 100 days.\n\n# Step 8: Reflecting on the Progress\n\nDespite easily being the worst couple months of my life and me never wishing for that type of sickness of even my worst enemy.\n\nI would be lying if I said that I didn\u2019t grow from it and that it is now an integral part of my life.\n\nI actually stumbled across a book called \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" while rotting away in bed. And there is a line that I have kept close to my heart and has helped me throughout everything.\n\n*\u201cThe struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man\u2019s heart.\u201d*\n\nThis was the process that I have used for unf\\*cking my life in 100 days, I hope that you\u2019ve taken something away from it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a habit tracker to help you build a specific habit for 100 days, I made \u201cFirst Hundred\u201d on IOS. But this was primarily a way of helping me track my daily walking habit in the beginning and thought that it could be helpful for you all (no paid features or account sign ups, just a simple habit tracker).", "reply_text": "I'm at that rock bottom point as of this very moment....

Clothes dirty, messy workspace, it\u2019s as if the physical matches what I was feeling internally.\n\nI felt terrible so I wouldn\u2019t take care of myself or my environment.\n\nThe environment didn\u2019t allow me to change so I felt terrible.\n\nIt was like an endless loop that dug me further and further down a hole.\n\nWhen I looked in the mirror, I saw someone who couldn\u2019t even take care of their hygiene or their messy room. What life changes was I going to make?\n\nSo, I took it slow.\n\nI cleaned my room. Then I cleaned my desk. I did my laundry. I took care of my hygiene. I got some new clothes.  \nAnd guess what?\n\nAfter months of rock bottom, I felt like I could change.\n\n# Step 2: Lessen the Screen Usage\n\nOn average, my screen time during that time was 11-13 hours a day. It consisted of watching movies I\u2019ve already watched, scrolling through endless social media, and revisiting the same 4-5 websites over and over again.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to improve my life so I scrolled. When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months. (still going)\n\nMeditation for nine months. (still continuing)\n\nNever in a million years did I think that I would be the type of person to use Therapy, but it\u2019s been an integral part of my growth overall as a person.\n\nI\u2019ve cut the things that haven\u2019t worked and worked ruthlessly on the things that have had a big impact on my life.\n\n# Step 4: Figure out what you want\n\nI was starting to get my life back together. But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life. Any book, article, or video on self-improvement that I could find was combined to these three things.\n\nThe first one being that there were only a few areas of my life that I really cared about.\n\nRelationships\n\nFun\n\nCareer\n\nFinances\n\nAnd Health\n\nI set two goals for each area of my life, one being a ceiling goal and the other being a floor goal.\n\nThe ceiling goal being the ambitious goal that I would be excited to hit.\n\nThe floor goal being the bare minimum that I was looking to hit.\n\nThis gave me a buffer between the two and helped me manage my expectations when working towards my goals as a person.\n\nThen came the last idea.\n\nI used to set really big goals until I was constantly disappointed. So, I started to focus on the input and not the output.\n\n# Step 5: Building your Schedule\n\nYou want to know what makes a good life?

When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months. (still going)\n\nMeditation for nine months. (still continuing)\n\nNever in a million years did I think that I would be the type of person to use Therapy, but it\u2019s been an integral part of my growth overall as a person.\n\nI\u2019ve cut the things that haven\u2019t worked and worked ruthlessly on the things that have had a big impact on my life.\n\n# Step 4: Figure out what you want\n\nI was starting to get my life back together. But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life. Any book, article, or video on self-improvement that I could find was combined to these three things.\n\nThe first one being that there were only a few areas of my life that I really cared about.\n\nRelationships\n\nFun\n\nCareer\n\nFinances\n\nAnd Health\n\nI set two goals for each area of my life, one being a ceiling goal and the other being a floor goal.\n\nThe ceiling goal being the ambitious goal that I would be excited to hit.\n\nThe floor goal being the bare minimum that I was looking to hit.\n\nThis gave me a buffer between the two and helped me manage my expectations when working towards my goals as a person.\n\nThen came the last idea.\n\nI used to set really big goals until I was constantly disappointed. So, I started to focus on the input and not the output.\n\n# Step 5: Building your Schedule\n\nYou want to know what makes a good life? Good years.\n\nA good year is made from good months.\n\nA good month is made from good weeks.\n\nA good week is made from good days.\n\nYou get my point. I now had everything in place to start to put everything into practice.\n\nI think it was best summed up here: Your life is made up of a series of ordinary Tuesdays. Figure out what your ideal normal Tuesday looks like. Because if you can have an amazing Tuesday, you\u2019ll probably have an amazing life. (Tim Ferriss, I believe)\n\nOf course, life has glorious ups and downs but that\u2019s maybe 10% of your life. I wanted to optimize for my own regular Tuesday, so this is currently the day I try to live every single day.\n\n8-8:30 am - Morning Routine  \n8:30- 10:30 am - Work  \n10:30-11 am - Meditate and Drive to the Gym  \n11-12:30 pm - Gym  \n12:30-1:30 pm - Lunch  \n1:30-3:30 pm - Work  \n3:30-4 pm - Eat a Snack  \n4-6 pm - Work  \n6-8 pm - Hangout with Friends / Family Dinner  \n8-10 pm - Hobbies  \n10-11 pm Wrap up Work  \n11-12 pm Night Routine\n\n# Step 6: Doing what you\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to do\n\nDespite being the biggest part of the entire 100 days, this was the easiest part to continue.\n\nI knew what I had to do, when I had to do it, and why I was doing it.\n\nThere was no confusion in my mind so everything just kind of became automatic for me.\n\nThis is easily the most important part of the 100 days. You see, everything before this was just preparing and getting in the right headspace to finally tackle the goals that I said that I would.\n\nWhenever I said that I would do something and I didn\u2019t do it. It stopped any momentum of progress that I had and made me lose trust in myself.\n\nI would then be consistent with my schedule for a couple of weeks then mess it up. This cycle happened over and over again.\n\nI became confident in my abilities by doing the things over and over again.\n\nI was building evidence in the type of person that I wanted to become. And that evidence came through setting goals. Achieving them. Setting goals. Achieving them.\n\nThere came a certain level of confidence when I said I would do something and I actually did it.\n\nSomething similar that I learned from therapy was despite having all of these grand ambitions, I could still be a friend to myself.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t treat anyone else as harshly as the way I treated myself. I thought it made me better, but it didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I criticized myself, I quit things quicker, felt the lows worse, and just felt a net negative to my overall life.\n\nWhen I treated myself better, I gave myself more opportunities, I spent longer on projects, and felt way better during the entire process.\n\nDo what you say you\u2019re going to do, but be nice to yourself in the process.\n\n# Step 7: Consistency over Everything\n\nAt this point, I could finally look at myself in the mirror. My health still wasn\u2019t 100% but it was through the habits that I was getting better.\n\nI could guarantee failure by quitting but being consistent was the only chance I had at success.\n\nI\u2019ve known this advice quite early, but I wish I could have followed it better.\n\nI always thought intensity could outwork consistency but I\u2019ve been wrong every single time.\n\nIt was actually taking walks that helped me out of that rock bottom.\n\nWhen I was nauseous and couldn\u2019t physically do anything else in the day, it was a promise to myself that I would walk for a minute outside.\n\nThat minute turned to five.\n\nThen to ten.\n\nThen to twenty.\n\nIt was the small promise to myself every single day that no matter how sick I felt, I would go for a walk.\n\nAnd it was the one habit that helped me pick myself up piece by piece to every other step of these 100 days.\n\n# Step 8: Reflecting on the Progress\n\nDespite easily being the worst couple months of my life and me never wishing for that type of sickness of even my worst enemy.\n\nI would be lying if I said that I didn\u2019t grow from it and that it is now an integral part of my life.\n\nI actually stumbled across a book called \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" while rotting away in bed. And there is a line that I have kept close to my heart and has helped me throughout everything.\n\n*\u201cThe struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man\u2019s heart.\u201d*\n\nThis was the process that I have used for unf\\*cking my life in 100 days, I hope that you\u2019ve taken something away from it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a habit tracker to help you build a specific habit for 100 days, I made \u201cFirst Hundred\u201d on IOS.

But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life.

Clothes dirty, messy workspace, it\u2019s as if the physical matches what I was feeling internally.\n\nI felt terrible so I wouldn\u2019t take care of myself or my environment.\n\nThe environment didn\u2019t allow me to change so I felt terrible.\n\nIt was like an endless loop that dug me further and further down a hole.\n\nWhen I looked in the mirror, I saw someone who couldn\u2019t even take care of their hygiene or their messy room. What life changes was I going to make?\n\nSo, I took it slow.\n\nI cleaned my room. Then I cleaned my desk. I did my laundry. I took care of my hygiene. I got some new clothes.  \nAnd guess what?\n\nAfter months of rock bottom, I felt like I could change.\n\n# Step 2: Lessen the Screen Usage\n\nOn average, my screen time during that time was 11-13 hours a day. It consisted of watching movies I\u2019ve already watched, scrolling through endless social media, and revisiting the same 4-5 websites over and over again.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to improve my life so I scrolled. When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months. (still going)\n\nMeditation for nine months. (still continuing)\n\nNever in a million years did I think that I would be the type of person to use Therapy, but it\u2019s been an integral part of my growth overall as a person.\n\nI\u2019ve cut the things that haven\u2019t worked and worked ruthlessly on the things that have had a big impact on my life.\n\n# Step 4: Figure out what you want\n\nI was starting to get my life back together. But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life. Any book, article, or video on self-improvement that I could find was combined to these three things.\n\nThe first one being that there were only a few areas of my life that I really cared about.\n\nRelationships\n\nFun\n\nCareer\n\nFinances\n\nAnd Health\n\nI set two goals for each area of my life, one being a ceiling goal and the other being a floor goal.\n\nThe ceiling goal being the ambitious goal that I would be excited to hit.\n\nThe floor goal being the bare minimum that I was looking to hit.\n\nThis gave me a buffer between the two and helped me manage my expectations when working towards my goals as a person.\n\nThen came the last idea.\n\nI used to set really big goals until I was constantly disappointed. So, I started to focus on the input and not the output.\n\n# Step 5: Building your Schedule\n\nYou want to know what makes a good life? Good years.\n\nA good year is made from good months.\n\nA good month is made from good weeks.\n\nA good week is made from good days.\n\nYou get my point. I now had everything in place to start to put everything into practice.\n\nI think it was best summed up here: Your life is made up of a series of ordinary Tuesdays.

You see, everything before this was just preparing and getting in the right headspace to finally tackle the goals that I said that I would.\n\nWhenever I said that I would do something and I didn\u2019t do it. It stopped any momentum of progress that I had and made me lose trust in myself.\n\nI would then be consistent with my schedule for a couple of weeks then mess it up. This cycle happened over and over again.\n\nI became confident in my abilities by doing the things over and over again.\n\nI was building evidence in the type of person that I wanted to become. And that evidence came through setting goals. Achieving them. Setting goals. Achieving them.\n\nThere came a certain level of confidence when I said I would do something and I actually did it.\n\nSomething similar that I learned from therapy was despite having all of these grand ambitions, I could still be a friend to myself.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t treat anyone else as harshly as the way I treated myself. I thought it made me better, but it didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I criticized myself, I quit things quicker, felt the lows worse, and just felt a net negative to my overall life.\n\nWhen I treated myself better, I gave myself more opportunities, I spent longer on projects, and felt way better during the entire process.\n\nDo what you say you\u2019re going to do, but be nice to yourself in the process.\n\n# Step 7: Consistency over Everything\n\nAt this point, I could finally look at myself in the mirror.

Clothes dirty, messy workspace, it\u2019s as if the physical matches what I was feeling internally.\n\nI felt terrible so I wouldn\u2019t take care of myself or my environment.\n\nThe environment didn\u2019t allow me to change so I felt terrible.\n\nIt was like an endless loop that dug me further and further down a hole.\n\nWhen I looked in the mirror, I saw someone who couldn\u2019t even take care of their hygiene or their messy room. What life changes was I going to make?\n\nSo, I took it slow.\n\nI cleaned my room. Then I cleaned my desk. I did my laundry. I took care of my hygiene. I got some new clothes.  \nAnd guess what?\n\nAfter months of rock bottom, I felt like I could change.\n\n# Step 2: Lessen the Screen Usage\n\nOn average, my screen time during that time was 11-13 hours a day. It consisted of watching movies I\u2019ve already watched, scrolling through endless social media, and revisiting the same 4-5 websites over and over again.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to improve my life so I scrolled. When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months. (still going)\n\nMeditation for nine months. (still continuing)\n\nNever in a million years did I think that I would be the type of person to use Therapy, but it\u2019s been an integral part of my growth overall as a person.\n\nI\u2019ve cut the things that haven\u2019t worked and worked ruthlessly on the things that have had a big impact on my life.\n\n# Step 4: Figure out what you want\n\nI was starting to get my life back together. But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life. Any book, article, or video on self-improvement that I could find was combined to these three things.\n\nThe first one being that there were only a few areas of my life that I really cared about.\n\nRelationships\n\nFun\n\nCareer\n\nFinances\n\nAnd Health\n\nI set two goals for each area of my life, one being a ceiling goal and the other being a floor goal.\n\nThe ceiling goal being the ambitious goal that I would be excited to hit.\n\nThe floor goal being the bare minimum that I was looking to hit.\n\nThis gave me a buffer between the two and helped me manage my expectations when working towards my goals as a person.\n\nThen came the last idea.\n\nI used to set really big goals until I was constantly disappointed. So, I started to focus on the input and not the output.\n\n# Step 5: Building your Schedule\n\nYou want to know what makes a good life? Good years.\n\nA good year is made from good months.\n\nA good month is made from good weeks.\n\nA good week is made from good days.\n\nYou get my point. I now had everything in place to start to put everything into practice.\n\nI think it was best summed up here: Your life is made up of a series of ordinary Tuesdays.

When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months. (still going)\n\nMeditation for nine months. (still continuing)\n\nNever in a million years did I think that I would be the type of person to use Therapy, but it\u2019s been an integral part of my growth overall as a person.\n\nI\u2019ve cut the things that haven\u2019t worked and worked ruthlessly on the things that have had a big impact on my life.\n\n# Step 4: Figure out what you want\n\nI was starting to get my life back together. But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life. Any book, article, or video on self-improvement that I could find was combined to these three things.\n\nThe first one being that there were only a few areas of my life that I really cared about.\n\nRelationships\n\nFun\n\nCareer\n\nFinances\n\nAnd Health\n\nI set two goals for each area of my life, one being a ceiling goal and the other being a floor goal.\n\nThe ceiling goal being the ambitious goal that I would be excited to hit.\n\nThe floor goal being the bare minimum that I was looking to hit.\n\nThis gave me a buffer between the two and helped me manage my expectations when working towards my goals as a person.\n\nThen came the last idea.\n\nI used to set really big goals until I was constantly disappointed. So, I started to focus on the input and not the output.\n\n# Step 5: Building your Schedule\n\nYou want to know what makes a good life?

Clothes dirty, messy workspace, it\u2019s as if the physical matches what I was feeling internally.\n\nI felt terrible so I wouldn\u2019t take care of myself or my environment.\n\nThe environment didn\u2019t allow me to change so I felt terrible.\n\nIt was like an endless loop that dug me further and further down a hole.\n\nWhen I looked in the mirror, I saw someone who couldn\u2019t even take care of their hygiene or their messy room. What life changes was I going to make?\n\nSo, I took it slow.\n\nI cleaned my room. Then I cleaned my desk. I did my laundry. I took care of my hygiene. I got some new clothes.  \nAnd guess what?\n\nAfter months of rock bottom, I felt like I could change.\n\n# Step 2: Lessen the Screen Usage\n\nOn average, my screen time during that time was 11-13 hours a day. It consisted of watching movies I\u2019ve already watched, scrolling through endless social media, and revisiting the same 4-5 websites over and over again.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to improve my life so I scrolled. When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months. (still going)\n\nMeditation for nine months. (still continuing)\n\nNever in a million years did I think that I would be the type of person to use Therapy, but it\u2019s been an integral part of my growth overall as a person.\n\nI\u2019ve cut the things that haven\u2019t worked and worked ruthlessly on the things that have had a big impact on my life.\n\n# Step 4: Figure out what you want\n\nI was starting to get my life back together. But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life. Any book, article, or video on self-improvement that I could find was combined to these three things.\n\nThe first one being that there were only a few areas of my life that I really cared about.\n\nRelationships\n\nFun\n\nCareer\n\nFinances\n\nAnd Health\n\nI set two goals for each area of my life, one being a ceiling goal and the other being a floor goal.\n\nThe ceiling goal being the ambitious goal that I would be excited to hit.\n\nThe floor goal being the bare minimum that I was looking to hit.\n\nThis gave me a buffer between the two and helped me manage my expectations when working towards my goals as a person.\n\nThen came the last idea.\n\nI used to set really big goals until I was constantly disappointed. So, I started to focus on the input and not the output.\n\n# Step 5: Building your Schedule\n\nYou want to know what makes a good life? Good years.\n\nA good year is made from good months.\n\nA good month is made from good weeks.\n\nA good week is made from good days.\n\nYou get my point. I now had everything in place to start to put everything into practice.\n\nI think it was best summed up here: Your life is made up of a series of ordinary Tuesdays. Figure out what your ideal normal Tuesday looks like. Because if you can have an amazing Tuesday, you\u2019ll probably have an amazing life. (Tim Ferriss, I believe)\n\nOf course, life has glorious ups and downs but that\u2019s maybe 10% of your life.

You see, everything before this was just preparing and getting in the right headspace to finally tackle the goals that I said that I would.\n\nWhenever I said that I would do something and I didn\u2019t do it. It stopped any momentum of progress that I had and made me lose trust in myself.\n\nI would then be consistent with my schedule for a couple of weeks then mess it up. This cycle happened over and over again.\n\nI became confident in my abilities by doing the things over and over again.\n\nI was building evidence in the type of person that I wanted to become. And that evidence came through setting goals. Achieving them. Setting goals. Achieving them.\n\nThere came a certain level of confidence when I said I would do something and I actually did it.\n\nSomething similar that I learned from therapy was despite having all of these grand ambitions, I could still be a friend to myself.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t treat anyone else as harshly as the way I treated myself.

Clothes dirty, messy workspace, it\u2019s as if the physical matches what I was feeling internally.\n\nI felt terrible so I wouldn\u2019t take care of myself or my environment.\n\nThe environment didn\u2019t allow me to change so I felt terrible.\n\nIt was like an endless loop that dug me further and further down a hole.\n\nWhen I looked in the mirror, I saw someone who couldn\u2019t even take care of their hygiene or their messy room. What life changes was I going to make?\n\nSo, I took it slow.\n\nI cleaned my room. Then I cleaned my desk. I did my laundry. I took care of my hygiene. I got some new clothes.  \nAnd guess what?\n\nAfter months of rock bottom, I felt like I could change.\n\n# Step 2: Lessen the Screen Usage\n\nOn average, my screen time during that time was 11-13 hours a day. It consisted of watching movies I\u2019ve already watched, scrolling through endless social media, and revisiting the same 4-5 websites over and over again.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to improve my life so I scrolled. When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months.

But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life.

So, I started to focus on the input and not the output.\n\n# Step 5: Building your Schedule\n\nYou want to know what makes a good life? Good years.\n\nA good year is made from good months.\n\nA good month is made from good weeks.\n\nA good week is made from good days.\n\nYou get my point.

What life changes was I going to make?\n\nSo, I took it slow.\n\nI cleaned my room. Then I cleaned my desk. I did my laundry. I took care of my hygiene. I got some new clothes.  \nAnd guess what?\n\nAfter months of rock bottom, I felt like I could change.\n\n# Step 2: Lessen the Screen Usage\n\nOn average, my screen time during that time was 11-13 hours a day. It consisted of watching movies I\u2019ve already watched, scrolling through endless social media, and revisiting the same 4-5 websites over and over again.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to improve my life so I scrolled. When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months.

(still continuing)\n\nNever in a million years did I think that I would be the type of person to use Therapy, but it\u2019s been an integral part of my growth overall as a person.\n\nI\u2019ve cut the things that haven\u2019t worked and worked ruthlessly on the things that have had a big impact on my life.\n\n# Step 4: Figure out what you want\n\nI was starting to get my life back together. But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life. Any book, article, or video on self-improvement that I could find was combined to these three things.\n\nThe first one being that there were only a few areas of my life that I really cared about.\n\nRelationships\n\nFun\n\nCareer\n\nFinances\n\nAnd Health\n\nI set two goals for each area of my life, one being a ceiling goal and the other being a floor goal.\n\nThe ceiling goal being the ambitious goal that I would be excited to hit.\n\nThe floor goal being the bare minimum that I was looking to hit.\n\nThis gave me a buffer between the two and helped me manage my expectations when working towards my goals as a person.\n\nThen came the last idea.\n\nI used to set really big goals until I was constantly disappointed. So, I started to focus on the input and not the output.\n\n# Step 5: Building your Schedule\n\nYou want to know what makes a good life? Good years.\n\nA good year is made from good months.\n\nA good month is made from good weeks.\n\nA good week is made from good days.\n\nYou get my point. I now had everything in place to start to put everything into practice.\n\nI think it was best summed up here: Your life is made up of a series of ordinary Tuesdays.

You see, everything before this was just preparing and getting in the right headspace to finally tackle the goals that I said that I would.\n\nWhenever I said that I would do something and I didn\u2019t do it.

And that evidence came through setting goals. Achieving them. Setting goals. Achieving them.\n\nThere came a certain level of confidence when I said I would do something and I actually did it.\n\nSomething similar that I learned from therapy was despite having all of these grand ambitions, I could still be a friend to myself.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t treat anyone else as harshly as the way I treated myself. I thought it made me better, but it didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I criticized myself, I quit things quicker, felt the lows worse, and just felt a net negative to my overall life.\n\nWhen I treated myself better, I gave myself more opportunities, I spent longer on projects, and felt way better during the entire process.\n\nDo what you say you\u2019re going to do, but be nice to yourself in the process.\n\n# Step 7: Consistency over Everything\n\nAt this point, I could finally look at myself in the mirror.

Clothes dirty, messy workspace, it\u2019s as if the physical matches what I was feeling internally.\n\nI felt terrible so I wouldn\u2019t take care of myself or my environment.\n\nThe environment didn\u2019t allow me to change so I felt terrible.\n\nIt was like an endless loop that dug me further and further down a hole.\n\nWhen I looked in the mirror, I saw someone who couldn\u2019t even take care of their hygiene or their messy room. What life changes was I going to make?\n\nSo, I took it slow.\n\nI cleaned my room. Then I cleaned my desk. I did my laundry. I took care of my hygiene. I got some new clothes.  \nAnd guess what?\n\nAfter months of rock bottom, I felt like I could change.\n\n# Step 2: Lessen the Screen Usage\n\nOn average, my screen time during that time was 11-13 hours a day. It consisted of watching movies I\u2019ve already watched, scrolling through endless social media, and revisiting the same 4-5 websites over and over again.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to improve my life so I scrolled. When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months.

Clothes dirty, messy workspace, it\u2019s as if the physical matches what I was feeling internally.\n\nI felt terrible so I wouldn\u2019t take care of myself or my environment.\n\nThe environment didn\u2019t allow me to change so I felt terrible.\n\nIt was like an endless loop that dug me further and further down a hole.\n\nWhen I looked in the mirror, I saw someone who couldn\u2019t even take care of their hygiene or their messy room. What life changes was I going to make?\n\nSo, I took it slow.\n\nI cleaned my room. Then I cleaned my desk. I did my laundry. I took care of my hygiene. I got some new clothes.  \nAnd guess what?\n\nAfter months of rock bottom, I felt like I could change.\n\n# Step 2: Lessen the Screen Usage\n\nOn average, my screen time during that time was 11-13 hours a day. It consisted of watching movies I\u2019ve already watched, scrolling through endless social media, and revisiting the same 4-5 websites over and over again.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to improve my life so I scrolled. When I got guilty, I would go to my desk to try and work, but would find some excuse to get back to my phone then would lose an hour.\n\nIt was the first thing I touched when I woke up.\n\nIt was the last thing I saw when I fell asleep.\n\nThere would not be minutes in the day when I didn\u2019t have my phone on me.\n\nThe turning point was when I realized that I did not have a single original thought in my day.\n\nEvery waking second was listening to a podcast, scrolling social media, or reading stuff online. Everything I thought was someone else\u2019s idea. So I had to change.\n\nThe first thing I did was get two phones. A crack phone and a kale phone.\n\nThe crack phone had every distraction app known to man. The kale phone only had access to messages and apps to help me live my life.\n\nThe crack phone I used during my break and the kale phone was the one I carried with me but since it has nothing on it, I didn\u2019t really use it.\n\nInstead of bargaining with myself when my willpower was weak, I removed the option completely. Now my screen time is around 1-2 hours every day.\n\n# Step 3: Trying out Healthy Habits\n\nAs a result of isolating myself away for so long, I started to get anxiety attacks whenever I did anything social.  \nIt felt like I couldn\u2019t control my thoughts and I would continue to spiral farther and farther until I could go home and be alone for a couple hours.\n\nI had been feeling things I\u2019ve never experienced before and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n\nSo I tried new things.\n\nJournaling for three days.\n\nPracticing gratitude for one week.\n\nTherapy for three months.\n\nConsistently going to the gym for six months. (still going)\n\nMeditation for nine months. (still continuing)\n\nNever in a million years did I think that I would be the type of person to use Therapy, but it\u2019s been an integral part of my growth overall as a person.\n\nI\u2019ve cut the things that haven\u2019t worked and worked ruthlessly on the things that have had a big impact on my life.\n\n# Step 4: Figure out what you want\n\nI was starting to get my life back together. But, I didn\u2019t have a direction that I was going in.\n\nThe habits that I continued to work on day in and day out, they were consistent but they didn\u2019t have any meaning behind them.\n\nIf you asked me, what were my goals: my answer was still the same \u201cI just wanted to feel like a normal person again.\u201d\n\nSo I spent the days learning about what I wanted out of life. Any book, article, or video on self-improvement that I could find was combined to these three things.\n\nThe first one being that there were only a few areas of my life that I really cared about.\n\nRelationships\n\nFun\n\nCareer\n\nFinances\n\nAnd Health\n\nI set two goals for each area of my life, one being a ceiling goal and the other being a floor goal.\n\nThe ceiling goal being the ambitious goal that I would be excited to hit.\n\nThe floor goal being the bare minimum that I was looking to hit.\n\nThis gave me a buffer between the two and helped me manage my expectations when working towards my goals as a person.\n\nThen came the last idea.\n\nI used to set really big goals until I was constantly disappointed. So, I started to focus on the input and not the output.\n\n# Step 5: Building your Schedule\n\nYou want to know what makes a good life? Good years.\n\nA good year is made from good months.\n\nA good month is made from good weeks.\n\nA good week is made from good days.\n\nYou get my point. I now had everything in place to start to put everything into practice.\n\nI think it was best summed up here: Your life is made up of a series of ordinary Tuesdays. Figure out what your ideal normal Tuesday looks like. Because if you can have an amazing Tuesday, you\u2019ll probably have an amazing life. (Tim Ferriss, I believe)\n\nOf course, life has glorious ups and downs but that\u2019s maybe 10% of your life. I wanted to optimize for my own regular Tuesday, so this is currently the day I try to live every single day.\n\n8-8:30 am - Morning Routine  \n8:30- 10:30 am - Work  \n10:30-11 am - Meditate and Drive to the Gym  \n11-12:30 pm - Gym  \n12:30-1:30 pm - Lunch  \n1:30-3:30 pm - Work  \n3:30-4 pm - Eat a Snack  \n4-6 pm - Work  \n6-8 pm - Hangout with Friends / Family Dinner  \n8-10 pm - Hobbies  \n10-11 pm Wrap up Work  \n11-12 pm Night Routine\n\n# Step 6: Doing what you\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to do\n\nDespite being the biggest part of the entire 100 days, this was the easiest part to continue.\n\nI knew what I had to do, when I had to do it, and why I was doing it.\n\nThere was no confusion in my mind so everything just kind of became automatic for me.\n\nThis is easily the most important part of the 100 days. You see, everything before this was just preparing and getting in the right headspace to finally tackle the goals that I said that I would.\n\nWhenever I said that I would do something and I didn\u2019t do it. It stopped any momentum of progress that I had and made me lose trust in myself.\n\nI would then be consistent with my schedule for a couple of weeks then mess it up. This cycle happened over and over again.\n\nI became confident in my abilities by doing the things over and over again.\n\nI was building evidence in the type of person that I wanted to become. And that evidence came through setting goals. Achieving them. Setting goals. Achieving them.\n\nThere came a certain level of confidence when I said I would do something and I actually did it.\n\nSomething similar that I learned from therapy was despite having all of these grand ambitions, I could still be a friend to myself.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t treat anyone else as harshly as the way I treated myself. I thought it made me better, but it didn\u2019t.\n\nWhen I criticized myself, I quit things quicker, felt the lows worse, and just felt a net negative to my overall life.\n\nWhen I treated myself better, I gave myself more opportunities, I spent longer on projects, and felt way better during the entire process.\n\nDo what you say you\u2019re going to do, but be nice to yourself in the process.\n\n# Step 7: Consistency over Everything\n\nAt this point, I could finally look at myself in the mirror. My health still wasn\u2019t 100% but it was through the habits that I was getting better.\n\nI could guarantee failure by quitting but being consistent was the only chance I had at success.\n\nI\u2019ve known this advice quite early, but I wish I could have followed it better.\n\nI always thought intensity could outwork consistency but I\u2019ve been wrong every single time.\n\nIt was actually taking walks that helped me out of that rock bottom.\n\nWhen I was nauseous and couldn\u2019t physically do anything else in the day, it was a promise to myself that I would walk for a minute outside.\n\nThat minute turned to five.\n\nThen to ten.\n\nThen to twenty.\n\nIt was the small promise to myself every single day that no matter how sick I felt, I would go for a walk.\n\nAnd it was the one habit that helped me pick myself up piece by piece to every other step of these 100 days.\n\n# Step 8: Reflecting on the Progress\n\nDespite easily being the worst couple months of my life and me never wishing for that type of sickness of even my worst enemy.\n\nI would be lying if I said that I didn\u2019t grow from it and that it is now an integral part of my life.\n\nI actually stumbled across a book called \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" while rotting away in bed. And there is a line that I have kept close to my heart and has helped me throughout everything.\n\n*\u201cThe struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man\u2019s heart.\u201d*\n\nThis was the process that I have used for unf\\*cking my life in 100 days, I hope that you\u2019ve taken something away from it.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a habit tracker to help you build a specific habit for 100 days, I made \u201cFirst Hundred\u201d on IOS.

", "reply_text": "I\u2019m not a member of this community, but this got pushed to me and it sounds so much like me five years ago it would feel wrong not to say something if it can help. \n\nMy life at that time looked good from the outside. I had what most considered a good job, relationships, and friends. However, my job was miserable day to day. I had gone through three promotions that all followed the same cycle. I felt terrible, got promoted, felt recognized, felt good for a while, and then that faded into feeling terrible again. I found no purpose in my work, and, as I looked at the people who were at the apex of my career path, I noticed the only one who appeared happy was the one most mocked by his peers for not committing to the job enough. In myself, I felt like I was coming to the end of my capacity to succeed in something I hated and it was starting to show in my performance. In relationships, I couldn\u2019t fight this nagging feeling that no one I dated would satisfy me long term. In friendships, I found myself surrounded by people like me who only wanted to focus on distraction from life and had nothing to provide when it came to help on any real emotional level.\n\nThe fix was Jesus. I don\u2019t mean religion, and I don\u2019t even mean the morality or world view that He gives. I grew up in church and by 17 or so I was convinced religion was bogus. I was probably best described as agnostic, but, even if there was a creator, I had seen enough chaos to know there was no real justice here and had learned too much to believe God was really invested in day to day life or believe the Bible was true. \n\nIn the despair and desperation I described, I cried out to God in an almost snarky way. Even so, in the next week I experienced an undeniable act of God\u2019s kindness. It was too much to be written off as coincidence, and, even if I tried to write it off, what has happened since then is just as undeniable. Although, I feel that makes me a terrible evangelist because as much as I can tell you about it I have no idea how to recreate that for someone and without it I fear I\u2019d still be right where I was.\n\nI\u2019ll try to wrap this up because I\u2019m sure no one wants to read this much, but the core of what I want you to know is that God teaches this concept of him giving a new heart. I know the feeling of the early 30s wasted life. It\u2019s an undercurrent of sorrow with passing moments of happiness. That was my heart. We try to overcome it by increasing the moments of happiness and trying to turn the tide, but it doesn\u2019t work no matter how much you succeed at generating the happy moments. The undercurrent has to change and from everything I tried Jesus is the only one that changes that home base. Now, life is an undercurrent of joy with fleeting moments of sorrow and, no matter how much sorrow stacks up at one time, just like it was the other way around it can\u2019t overcome the joy. I don\u2019t know if this will be helpful, but seeing where you are and knowing so many others are right there it would be unloving of me to pass by without saying something. I do truly hope you find joy and purpose."}, {"comment_text": "I realized that a lot of people out there really don't care or want what's best for you...

And like any skill, it can be developed and improved. \n\nHere are three strategies for inspiring yourself to take on new challenges or focus your efforts on what really matters to you. \n\n1. **Set clear (SMART) goals.** Having clear, meaningful goals transforms a vague dream into a plan you can start today. For a motivation boost, try splitting big goals into smaller, more achievable steps. One way to break down large ambitions is to create SMART goals: **specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound tasks**. SMART tasks give you a clear path forward and keep things moving. \n\n2. **Leverage visualization.** Many successful entrepreneurs say that visualization was a helpful tool during the early days of their business. Likewise, athletes and sports psychologists often cite visualization as a key component of their training routines. By picturing yourself achieving your goals, you can stimulate the motivation needed to make that vision a reality. In a business context, you might visualize yourself delivering a successful pitch, launching a new product, or acing a job interview. Make your visualizations as specific and detailed as possible. By mentally rehearsing these scenarios, you\u2019re training your brain to focus on the skills you want to develop.\n\n3. **Cultivate a positive mindset.** Positivity boosts motivation. Techniques like mindfulness and meditation can help you pay more attention to the joyful and exciting elements of the challenges you encounter, rather than the difficult parts. Research suggests that having a growth mindset, where you view challenges as opportunities for learning rather than obstacles, fosters resilience and a drive to succeed.

In a business context, you might visualize yourself delivering a successful pitch, launching a new product, or acing a job interview. Make your visualizations as specific and detailed as possible. By mentally rehearsing these scenarios, you\u2019re training your brain to focus on the skills you want to develop.\n\n3. **Cultivate a positive mindset.** Positivity boosts motivation. Techniques like mindfulness and meditation can help you pay more attention to the joyful and exciting elements of the challenges you encounter, rather than the difficult parts. Research suggests that having a growth mindset, where you view challenges as opportunities for learning rather than obstacles, fosters resilience and a drive to succeed.

Look at smaller companies and roles one level under your title or somewhere in between. \n\nIn the interview process, say you really liked your last company and were in it for the long haul, but unfortunately they were restructuring and it sounded like they were eventually going to outsource your department and a few others. If it\u2019s an in-office job, make a comment to the interviewer that you like the office building or area (if it\u2019s actually decent) and/or a \u201cwow, it\u2019s actually really nice being inside and seeing people together in an office, I actually miss that\u201d etc. (I know \ud83d\ude44). \n\nThe personalities that thrive in C-suite management and end up interviewing you after recruiters and HR are not always ones that you will click with, because they are freaks. Ask them questions about themselves and how they started out in \u201cx,y,z\u201d areas of their job and then a wow, and now you run this dept. sort of thing. If you get asked a technical question that you are able to answer, follow up with an adjacent but not testing question. So if they mentioned or asked you about this coding or program or machine, you should answer and then ask a really broad question re: their opinion on how they like working with that or is most of your team utilizing that etc. Emphasis on asking their opinion and make it broad as f because you don\u2019t want to embarrass them. \n\nIf they do the stupid \u201cwhat\u2019s your weakness?\u201d Say that you are old school if your interviewer is older and that sometimes it takes you a second to connect with the younger crowd despite being young ish because they always have AirPods in or say things like \u201cNo Cap\u201d. And laugh. Another alternative \u201cweakness\u201d you can use is that you grew up in a family that was really great but has the worst cheesiest sense of humor and that you will most likely drop horrible popsicle stick jokes here and there and ask for forgiveness in advance.

Dress nicely, fitted clothes. Firm handshake, dry palms, eye contact. \n\nOh also if they ask what you did in all your months off, say you actually figured it would probably be the only opportunity you ever got to relax and travel for the year so you went to Hawaii for a month, up North in your area, hiking every weekend, stuff like that or activities that seem like you are wealthy and unbothered."}, {"comment_text": "good advice!

You just need to get your foot wet and once you build up experience you could pivot to your next tech role if you want to.

You had a full-time job for 8 months after finishing school.  Now you work part-time as a math tudor.  You havn't really worked hard.  You are trying to find a developer job in the Bay area after one of the largest rounds of layoffs in the industry.  You live in the single most developer dense area on the planet, and there are thousands of other, more experienced developers, out of work there as well.  Yet you are unwilling to relocate for a better opportunity.  It's not motivation that you lack as much as poor decision making.  Taking a few more years to get a different degree isn't going to solve your problems.  You need to go where the work is.  If you think product managment is somehow less soul-sucking than software engineering, you have some things to learn that are not taught in school.  Life is hard.  Life is suffering.  Hard work is not immediately rewarded.  We don't all find our means of generating income to be something that we can derive happiness and contentment from, but sometimes it can come with a sense of satisfaction.  Do what needs to be done.  Relocation doesn't mean a permanent separation and it is likely, and commonly is, a source of personal growth.  Your career is not your identity.

These sources create short-lived motivation boosts.  They work at first but they fade fast. \n\nOn the other hand, **intrinsic motivation** radiates from within.  It\u2019s long-lasting, self-sustaining, and compounds over time. With intrinsic motivation, you work because you want to\u2014not because you have to. You\u2019ll never find hard work easy if you don\u2019t first master this. \n\nThere are 5 levers that influence intrinsic motivation:  \n\n**\u2022 Curiosity:**  The desire to learn everything about your work. Yearning for knowledge activates your brain's reward system, which releases dopamine to boost your focus and pleasure.\n\n**\u2022 Mastery:**  About the pursuit of excellence. The never-ending quest to improve. The process of acquiring skills triggers the release of endorphins and dopamine, the biochemical markers of progression.

These sources create short-lived motivation boosts.  They work at first but they fade fast. \n\nOn the other hand, **intrinsic motivation** radiates from within.  It\u2019s long-lasting, self-sustaining, and compounds over time. With intrinsic motivation, you work because you want to\u2014not because you have to. You\u2019ll never find hard work easy if you don\u2019t first master this. \n\nThere are 5 levers that influence intrinsic motivation:  \n\n**\u2022 Curiosity:**  The desire to learn everything about your work. Yearning for knowledge activates your brain's reward system, which releases dopamine to boost your focus and pleasure.\n\n**\u2022 Mastery:**  About the pursuit of excellence. The never-ending quest to improve. The process of acquiring skills triggers the release of endorphins and dopamine, the biochemical markers of progression.

So all I do is focus on what makes me happy, like meeting my friends, and also on the next thing in my career.

So that\u2019s the only two things I focus on to take my mind of failures pf my past. and whenever I feel down and embarrassed I try to peep-talk myself about small things in life that I have, like I recently bought a Nintendo switch, and that makes me happy. so looking forward and having a short term goal that will make life easier once accomplish and diverting my attention to small positive things in my life is making me feel less shitty about everyone around me knowing about my struggles as I am trying to show them a new better version of myself.\n\nI feel like I am just rambling.

Mental health on Anxiety, Shy, Introversion, Scared to talk to girls, etc wasn't something talked about back then. But today they are. They don't know the struggle. My neighbor, smart guy but honestly he has his own problems to deal with, He's got 2 kids that are 10 years apart. He has an okay job that's possible going away. His wife earns more money than him. He's had a hard life. Has health issues. So he probably sees me as this guy who has it made yet does nothing.\n\nSame thing with one of my uncles. and some other people in their 35-50 age range.

While it's taking many of us much, much longer to do the same. People will judge regardless on what you do. You could get fit in the gym, 6 pack abs and everything. Yet people will still judge you because you did something they wish they could do. But don't do. Could also be, the people you feel are judging you, only have 1 aspect of their life together and you trying to get many aspects of life together. Could be anything.\n\nI feel like the only one's who've seen me at my best are my co-workers when I worked in retail or the small computer company. Where people listened to my thoughts and gave feedback. When i worked hard and got things done, they all noticed. Meanwhile My family, friends, neighbors have only seen me at my worst. When I get depressed, when I fail a lot. When my friends move out and have experience living out on there own, only to come back home because their jobs don't pay enough. Yet I'm waiting until I learn x skill and become really good at it, get a much better paying job and move out properly and stay there. I'd rather do it right the first time then this 'Start and Stop' pattern everyone else seems to want to do.\n\nI have issues with the jobs around here that only pay $16-$20 an hour when you really need $25 or more to actually move out and be somewhat stable. \"At least you have a job\", Yea....But you got no money. Is that really worth moving out? \"It's what most people do\", that's a really good way to get trapped. We should be thriving right now but no lol\n\nTLDR; Most people don't know what their doing. From experience, many people only have 1 or 2 aspects of their shit together. People judge regardless of what you do. We're all living longer, 30 is not a death sentence. Many of us won't earn real good money till we're 30-45. Some people are lucky to do this at 20-25. But that's not the norm. Do things according to your timeline. When YOU feel ready to move on.

Is that embarrassing?\n\nOf these three things, which of them am I responsible for? Which one am I in control of?\n\nIn the first case, I'm only somewhat in control of getting sick. I can take precautions but, realistically, life involves inevitable exposure to pathogens. So my responsibility and control over getting sick is somewhat limited. It seems hard to feel bad about that. I can control the way I respond to being sick, though. \n\nIn the second case, I literally did nothing and could do nothing to prevent the fact that I was born with a cleft palate, nor could I control what some doctor did to fix it and the quality of the procedure. \n\nIn the third case, I can't control traffic.

Perhaps even less on our control than the flu, actually ... there's no mask you can wear that will prevent depression. \n\nDon't listen to your mind's tricks. Do not feel responsible, embarrassed, or guilty for things truly out of your control. Spend those feelings on what you can control, your response.\n\nThe difference between shame and guilt is that shame is public, guilt is private. Don't let others make you feel shame for things you cannot control either. The shame is theirs for not understanding the situation. You don't shame someone for having the wrong skin color or a cleft palate. \n\nInstead, ask yourself, in this situation that has happened to me, what is my part? What can I control?

I felt ashamed of taking so long to figure things out, not knowing where to start, feeling like I don't get far. I thought other people had those harsh judgements of me but realistically... I mainly only heard myself think/say those things to myself. The people that loved me and cared for me did not. They did their best to support me in their own ways. Once I learned that it came from myself, it helped me understand that these are my own thoughts that I need to work on. So be honest with yourself, how many of the people who you think are judging you have actually indicated they were judging you specifically? If they did, it's something we can choose to speak up about or let it go - how important is this person to your life?\n\n\n\n2) that's not to say there weren't people who judged me or shamed me. But I quickly learned that having those people in my life was actually one of the largest barriers of me overcoming my feelings of shame and self judgement. Once they were gone, i quickly learned that I was able to overcome those things that felt so difficult.

And we need to take that into account, we used to raise children with villages families had Support around them all day long we had communities we had people to lean on and talk to, we supported each other we worked through issues together. Most of life was surrounding community and us being together we have been so isolated it\u2019s causing an epidemic of loneliness, so many people are in despair, including myself at many times.

It's OK to be in a different stage in life than other people, and it's OK to work on things at your own pace. One thing I find to be helpful is to create a balance between studying and work and the things I actually want to do. Study for an hour, then go on a walk and get food or go to the store. Then study for another 2 hours and then play video games for 30 minutes. \n\nTry not to be so hard on yourself. I was very hard on myself my whole life only to discover last year that bullying yourself into submission is not effective. You need to be kind to yourself, and recognize and congratulate yourself for your successes. When you fail at something, remember, it's better to try and fail than not to try at all.\n\n Community college is generally designed to be very easy to pass, and the professors almost always genuinely want you to pass and will work with you to help you pass. If you speak to a college counselor, they can also help you plan for your future and provide resources for mental health and that sort of thing.\n\nI also recommend going to the gym a few days a week, getting outside in the sun every day for at least an hour, and maintaining a good diet with a lot of hydration. Doing those things plus getting consistent sleep will mean you have more energy for studying, and if you can build it into a habit of studying for a few hours each day, it becomes just part of the routine and not \"ugh, something I have to do\", if that makes sense. \n\nHope this helps."}, {"comment_text": ">I was very hard on myself my whole life only to discover last year that bullying yourself into submission is not effective.\n\n>21M here\n\nI'm sorry, but this made me laugh.

It's a small read and hopefully it'll give you a fresh perspective on things.\n\n\"Once upon a time there was a water bearer who carried two pots of water to his teacher each day. Each day he would walk to the nearest stream, fill both pots with water, and walk back, one pot on each side of a pole he carried across his neck. One pot was cracked, and so by the time the water bearer reached his teacher, it was only half full. This continued for two years, with the water bearer only bringing one and a half pots of water. The perfect pot was proud of its achievements. The cracked pot was sad that it could only do half the job it was supposed to do. One day, the cracked pot said to the water bearer, \u2018I feel so upset and ashamed. I\u2019m imperfect and I can\u2019t hold a full pot of water. What use am I to anyone?\u2019 The water bearer told the cracked pot to look on the ground as he carried it. The cracked pot noticed the most beautiful wild flowers and plants on its side of the path. The water bearer explained, \u2018When I realised you were cracked, I decided to plant seeds on one side of the path, and every day, as you leak, you water that side of the path. If you weren\u2019t cracked, these gorgeous flowers wouldn\u2019t be here for all to enjoy.\u2019 \n\nSometimes you may think you\u2019re not perfect but how do you know? This story goes to show that even a cracked pot can be seen as perfect just as it is. In the same way, you\u2019re perfect just the way you are, with all your imperfections \u2013 they\u2019re what make you unique.\"\n\nWhen you compare yourselves with others, why do you choose to look at their accomplishments? Look at what you have achieved that they can only dream of. Think about all the people who's lives you have positively impacted.

Are there foods you like to treat yourself to? Could you use end rewards to motivate you to work through something? Could doing an enjoyable activity first give you a mood boost to do the less exciting thing after?\n\nYou\u2019re in retail, so what? You have a job, and you\u2019re trying. You can always change jobs later. Retail is not your life nor label. It\u2019s temporary.\n\nWhy do you feel bad about not partying? You can have fun without being in crowded, social environments, substance use, or whatever else you may be \u201cmissing out on.\u201d I\u2019ve never partied. It\u2019s not my thing. I don\u2019t do it because I won\u2019t enjoy it, and whether people judge me for it or not, I\u2019m happier without that in my life. Presumably, you\u2019d be partying if you enjoyed it.\n\nIf you\u2019re certain you can retake the test later, then if you really need to, don\u2019t feel bad about skipping it. You can focus on finding something that makes studying easier. Snacking on your favourite chips, writing in coloured pens to make it prettier, connecting topics to your favourite TV show. Whatever will make it feel fun or less like a chore and also easier for you to remember.\n\nThere are so many things that could be impacting you right now. Stress, poor sleep, poor nutrition, mental health issues, external pressures to succeed (like unnecessarily comparing yourself to your sister).\n\nThis may not be the most helpful comment (I\u2019m starting to fall asleep and my thoughts are all over the place, sorry), but there are ways to work around what you\u2019re struggling with. Professional help is best if it is available to you and something you are comfortable with and WANT to put in the work to get better. But you can always retrain your thoughts by yourself over time. You\u2019re always good enough. There is nothing wrong with you. You\u2019re doing your best. Yes, even when you decide to skip a test. It\u2019s not great, no, but you need to put your mental health first and find a different approach to your schoolwork to make it easier for you. Lots of people burnout quickly. The less pressure you place on yourself, the easier it may be to start meeting deadlines without completely procrastinating until the last minute.\nThis is really long and my brain is almost entirely fried. I hope you\u2019re able to find some helpful pieces within this comment (and I know there are other helpful comments from others, too), and if you need me to be clearer about anything, or to expand on anything, let me know and I\u2019ll respond in the morning!\nAlso, be gentle with yourself. Correct any thought of self-hate with self-love. You can love yourself, even when you\u2019re struggling, and that\u2019s when you need it the most."}, {"comment_text": "I\u2019m 19F and find myself comparing myself to everyone.

I will also say that \"we\" are very, very good at finding each other even if we don't know we're doing it. My ex from like 15 years ago was diagnosed not long after me. A couple of my friends as well. And in the latter case, that's adults fighting tooth and nail for a UK diagnosis, so there's no argument about mass diagnosing kids to make money or shut them up or whatever (not that I think much of that anyway). If your relationship group is at all similar, it's worth thinking about. If you're familiar with thinking that there's just people who \"get you\" and think similarly to you while most people are kind of confusing and frustrating, that's familiar too.\n\nI would say my neurodivergent radar is 90% accurate. Spend some time with people who do have ADHD or similar conditions and ask for their honest thoughts. It's a step in the right direction.\n\nBeyond that, the main way I got diagnosed was by asking for a trial prescription of ADHD meds. A small dose for \"normal\" people is just like a caffeine buzz (and if you don't really get a caffeine buzz, well... you're probably one of us lol) and isn't physically addictive so it doesn't really do any harm short term. If your doctor agrees to that, worst case scenario is you got some fun drugs (some people with prescriptions may even let you try one, but of course it's a restricted drug, so I cannot condone that and am shaking my head and frowning at the idea)"}, {"comment_text": "I'm 20.

But I guess its time I admit this fake it til you make it attitude isn't doing me any wonders and it's exhausting. \n\nThat being said, I have had bouts of years where I've gotten shit done during the last decade. My running theory (is that a saying? Sorry English isn't my first language) since many years has been im terribly overstimulated and I have an addictive personality as in I tend to overconsume things for short term dopamine spikes which hurts my dopamine baseline, which in turn halters my motivation.\n\nI once cut out most of those cheap dopamine spikes and I really felt it did me favours. I quit nicotine, unplugged the pc and the tv, cut out masturbation, cut out reddit and cut down other consumerism behaviors like scrolling, YouTube etc.\n\nI still believe in this for me so maybe you can draw some inspiration from that. \n\nSadly literally all these have creeped their way back into my life over the years so I guess maybe it's time to go cold turkey again for me. Or maybe I need a more long term strategy this time, I don't know, its not easy. But it did make everything soo much easier. Being neat and tidy and hard working in general wasnt hard for me then, I just did it...

But idk I'm here I guess procrastinating, feeling lazy and confused as if my brain is fog. Sighs ", "reply_text": "Here are some things I do:\n\nFirst, I regularly think about where I want to be in a few years, identify goals, and then identify what I can do in the next year / month to move in that direction. Then I put clear, small pieces of that on my calendar for the next week. For example if my goal is fixing my health, a clear small task would be booking a doc appointment. Knowing that everything on my calendar is something I've committed to, and is directly tied to my long term goals for myself, helps with motivation.\n\nSecond, I make sure to do 3+ hours of stuff (any stuff) tied to my goals every day, first thing. I tell myself I can relax after that. But I have to \"eat the frog\", do the stuff I'm struggling with first thing every day while my willpower is at its maximum, and before I've eaten any big meal that slows me down.\n\nThird, I try to monitor my own thoughts and reject unhelpful ones. E.g. if I think \"oh, this is pointless\" then I'll remind myself \"hey, you don't know what it will result in until you do it\", or if I think \"you'll never be good at this\" I remind myself \"I'm choosing to believe in myself because that's the path to success\", or if I think \"its not good enough\" I think \"look, I can always improve it later, but for now I just need to make progress on it and reach this milestone\". Basically monitoring for and directly challenging unhelpful thoughts.\n\nFourth, if I can't make myself focus on a goal, I make my first step super small, just enough to get started. For example if my goal is to read a book, but I can't make myself do it, I set a goal of reading it for 5 minutes. That seems easy... and I end up reading for 30, and making progress, instead of not starting. If I find I can simply never start on a task, even for 5 minutes, I step back, meditate a bit, and ask myself why I don't want to do this, what am I trying to avoid, what's the deeper emotional reason here? Usually it boils down to some variant of \"deep down I don't believe that doing this will help me\" and now I know the reason I can address it.\n\nFifth, I try to build up my habit of self discipline with small steps, things like making my bed every morning before I go do stuff. Small habits of putting my life in order that I do regularly.... help me build momentum and improve my self discipline. The key is that they only take 60 seconds each but they make me feel like I have agency.\n\nThere's a lot more than this obviously but these are some techniques I use."}, {"comment_text": "3+ hours a day? Just curious is that in addition to work?", "reply_text": "If I'm doing work that is changing my life for the better, if it is helping me meet my goals, then it counts towards the target. 3 hours of that meets my quota for the day. \n\nIf, on the other hand, the work I'm doing is merely a chore I feel like I'm just doing to pay the bills, not because it improves my life, then no, it doesn't count. Generally, any stuff I have to do in order to maintain the status quo doesn't count, because its just maintenance, its not moving me forward. Only stuff that moves me forward, stuff that produces change towards a desired future state, counts.\n\nOn days where I did not feel up to doing 3 hours, I ask myself if I can do 30 minutes. If I can't, I tell myself \"hey, I can surely do 5 minutes\".\n\nThe point is to make it as easy as possible for me to get started on changing my life for the better. Not to try to find excuses as to why I can't do it. And not to get so caught up with maintenance / chores stuff I have to do, that I neglect putting in the energy needed to actually change/improve my situation."}, {"comment_text": "Everyday a new day begins and all I'm doing in my life is being controlled by my thoughts.

Sighs ", "reply_text": "I've had motivational problems like this for years from two different mental health issues. Perfectionism and fear were two of my bigger problems. Perfectionism held me back from doing things because of thoughts like \"What if it's not working 100%? What if it's not on a standard level or above?\" I got rid of that mindset. Just do it, don't fear the outcome. You can always correct it. Nothing is forever, everything can be changed. If people try to shame you for mistakes, they are not people to be around. In the end, the only thing that solved it for me was the realization that I can ultimately do what I want. \n\nStarting was the hardest part for me. Once you've forced yourself through this you're good. After you've done it a couple of times (need discipline for two weeks), you will do it automatically and without any second thoughts. There has been research about the topic of \"when does a new activity become a habbit\", which showed that repeating something for about 15 times (+-, depending on the person) is enough to make it a habbit. Treat your inner voice like a child: Sometimes you have to have a talk to yourself and say \"Sorry body, I'm in command and we are doing this now\""}]}]
