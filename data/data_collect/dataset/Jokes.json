If your dog speaks like a man heed its dire warning.\n* Don't trust the squirrel with the child's face. It speaks only lies.\n* When your double arrives, resist the inclination to fight it. It may be stronger than you. Chances are it will disappear after the eclipse. Be careful it doesn't switch places, it will be a few decades before you get the chance to come back.\n* If you stare into the void, and it blinks first, you win. But the prize is insanity.\n* Werewolves are not only impossible to kill during an eclipse, they become SUPER WEREWOLVES.\n* Whatever you do don't buy any weird plants, we don't want a repeat of last time.\n* Apophis, the Moon Serpent, may try to eat you. Let him.\n* If once upon a time you were falling in love, but now your only falling apart, there's nothing you can do.
