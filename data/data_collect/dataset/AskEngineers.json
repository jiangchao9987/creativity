Overall, my experience at the company has been positive. The work-life balance seems to be good, I like the people I work with, and my supervisors are happy with my work. Still, I struggle with motivation because I lack interest in some of what I do. From my own personal experiences and what I\u2019ve seen from my supervisors, I\u2019ve learned I don\u2019t enjoy design/construction and I don\u2019t want to progress to where my bosses are. I\u2019m considering doing a thesis master\u2019s in Environmental Engineering to set myself up for a career in a lab/research. I originally wanted to go straight from undergrad to grad school, but didn\u2019t apply since I wasn\u2019t sure I would get in to a program (3.1 GPA, no research experience, 1 internship, no relationships with professors). Now I regret not applying. There are some programs that have some late final deadlines or spring admissions and I\u2019m tempted to apply. Before I try, I have some questions.\n\n1. Would a master\u2019s in Environmental Engineering help me towards my professional goal of going into research? (Disclaimer: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready to apply to a PhD program given my stats and experience. Also, the financial aspect of a master\u2019s is not a problem since I have 2 years of GI Bill to cover my tuition.)\n\n2. If anyone has an Environmental Engineering background and works in research, can you explain where you work and what kind of projects you work on?\n\n3. Is 1 year too early to quit my job without damaging my reputation at this company?\n\n4. Is it too late to reach out to professors about letters of recommendation? I have a few professors in mind for recs but I don\u2019t want to ruin my reputation with them for asking so late"}, {"comment_text": "As a reminder, /r/AskEngineers normal restrictions for career related posts are severely relaxed for this thread, so feel free to ask about intra-office politics, salaries, or just about anything else related to your job!", "reply_text": "Help with College Major or even career?\n\nI tried making a post and it got taken down and was told to put it here so I\u2019m not too sure this is the right place or even subreddit to ask for help but I figured I\u2019d try.

Move the whole assembly back and forth to find the balance point of the crane on top of the ruler. Mark that balance point on the base plate.\n\nMeasure the distance from the front edge of the base plate to that mark. This is your Righting Arm, Lr.\\*\n\nNow set your crane on the counter and extended it out as far as it can reach. Use your ruler as a plumb bob to transfer the center of the grabby hand to the counter. Mark this position.\n\nWithout moving the crane, measure to that mark from the front edge of the base plate. This is your Overturning Arm, Lo.\n\nNow we can calculate your Overturning Load, Wo. When the CoG of the system (crane and load) reaches the front edge of the base plate and is on the cusp of overturning, the balance of moments will look like this:\n\nRighting Moment = Overturning Moment  \nWc \\* Lr = Wo \\* Lo\n\nRearrange to solve for Wo:  \nWo = (Wc \\* Lr) / Lo\n\nYou can increase the lifting capacity by adding a little counterweight (CW) to either the back of the base plate or the back of the vertical part of the arm. You can repeat the above with the added CW to check your new lifting capacity (or, if you know the CW weight and CoG, you can add it mathematically). Note that at some amount of CW, overall stability will stop governing and member stability/strength will become the limiting resistance.\n\n\\*note that as the crane rotates, both the balance point (center of gravity) and the width of the plate in the plane of the arm change and so this arm length also changes. We're not exactly doing critical lifts here, so it will be okay for approximations."}, {"comment_text": "It's not about the weight of the total structure, it's about the distribution of the weight.

We just removed the whole unit and replaced it with a spare. It took us two hours to do this and restore the machine and hand it over back to production. We spent 2 hours on breakdown maintenance. Then after production was restored, we took the faulty Tool Changer unit back to our workshop, replaced some bearings and seals or whatever and repaired it. Now it's ready. We have a spare. ....The word \"Breakdown\" is used if production is affected. We 'repaired' something but production was not affected....Our job as part of the maintenance team is to minimise the time spent on 'Breakdown maintenance ' because it is a direct indicator of our inefficiency. If my maintenance program was top notch, I would have planned a Tool change unit overhaul on any time that did not affect production. ( Or my predictive maintenance program would have caught this imminent failure and acted accordingly).To do this, the maintenance team usually work on Holidays and then take 'offs' on weekdays (different people on different days).
