The problem is that this promotion came with a total of 5% pay raise.

I should be disappoint and start looking elsewhere for advancement, right?\n\nNow, to play devil\u2019s advocate, I\u2019ve only been in the R&D II role for 6 months, so this is a very fast series of promotions. Going from Engineer I to Engineer II was 8%, so I was expecting at least that for this current promotion as well, but maybe the bean counters saw it differently since these two promotions happened in less than a year of each other and they\u2019re hesitant to allow such a fast increase.\n\nAs for why I got a second promotion so fast, it\u2019s because I was already doing work at the Sr level as I understand it. I\u2019ve applied for 5 patents in the past year and the company is sending me on international business trips to meet with vendors.

Are there any levels between Engineer II and Senior Engineer? If so, then yes, 3% can seem really small. Otherwise, if not, then it may be a mediocre raise.\n\nTraveling as an Engineer II, even internationally, is not unusual. International travel for an Engineer I might be more unusual but it could happen once a year.\n\nBut I will say that perhaps you may have been an Engineer II that was getting paid at the top of the pay band, meaning that any further raise, even without promotion, would have put you in another pay band, thus promoting you was their only choice, otherwise you'd be an overpaid Engineer II, indicating poor performance.\n\nMy former manager once told me that if you don't get promoted to the next skill level within a few years, you may notice that your raises will get smaller due to the limitations of the pay band.\n\nAlso, just because you submitted patent disclosures doesn't mean they will be awarded. It's very difficult to get a patent rewarded, expensive too. I remember one of my colleagues went all the way with a patent disclosure until the patent attorney failed to defend the patent disclosure in court, and ultimately, he was not rewarded with the invention. It takes many months to get awarded a patent. Fast tracking can get rewarded within 6 months, but typically, they take about 18 months.

I knew that working for a startup and being promoted so fast would leave me behind the curve, but the gap just seems to be getting wider the higher the job title gets.\n\nNaively, I assumed the increase would accelerate the higher I went, especially since the step up to senior is significant, but it\u2019s the opposite. Going from I to II was 8%, and now from II to Sr was 3-5% (depending on if you include the COLA). What\u2019s the increase to Staff going to be? 2%?

This post is intended to provide an ongoing resource for job hunters to get an idea of the salary they should ask for based on location and job title. Survey responses are NOT vetted or verified, and should not be considered data of sufficient quality for statistical or other data analysis.\n\nSo what's the point of this survey? We hope that by collecting responses every quarter, job hunters can use it as a supplement to other salary data sites like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Glassdoor and PayScale to negotiate better compensation packages when they switch jobs.\n\n> [Archive of past surveys](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/search/?q=flair%3A%22salary+survey%22&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new)\n\n## Useful websites\n\nFor Americans, BLS is the gold standard when it comes to labor data. A guide for how to use BLS can be found in our wiki:\n\n* [*How do I figure out how much salary to ask for?

For example, the Canadian counterpart to BLS is [StatCan](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start), and [DE Statis](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Labour/Labour-Market/Employment/_node.html) for Germany.\n\n* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/member/home/index.htm)\n\n* [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/)\n\n# How to participate / Survey instructions\n\nA template is provided at the bottom of this post to standardize reporting total compensation from your job.

You may also be running into mesh size issues causing artificial stress concentrations."}, {"comment_author": "HookPropScrum", "comment_text": "Unless you're also trying to model something else, FEA is not the right tool for this analysis. Under-head stress can be determined simply by calculating the force per unit contact area as others have said. Capability to resist load in a transverse direction can be done by simply applying a coefficient of friction to your clamping force. Appropriately conservative coefficients for different material couples can be found in Machinery's Handbook, Shigley's, or [other references](https://s3vi.ndc.nasa.gov/ssri-kb/static/resources/nasa-std-5020.pdf). These should also contain the basic steps to designing a bolted joint, which can be done on a hand calc basis for most normal applications. These hand calculations, when performed correctly, are a quicker and more correct way to design a basic bolted joint than a finite element model (especially for contact stress, which is a trivial calculation and is often incorrect in FEA)\n\nFEA is not a cure-all, and it will not provide you with useful results if you do not set it up correctly. Boundary conditions matter. Properly applied contacts and loads matter. Mesh quality matters. Correct model geometry matters. If you just throw a model together without understanding it, you will not get usable results. You should always verify your model with hand calculations - obviously you can't verify everything in it (the model would be pointless if you could), but the bulk phenomena can be checked to validate that your system is properly setup.\n\nLooking at your model results, the substantial asymmetry in the stress patterns suggests that your mesh is probably too coarse. You also look like you've simplified the connection of two plates into a single body, which I would not recommend given that you've said that the plates are loaded in shear. In the future when presenting FEA results, you should always show your mesh, show your boundary conditions/loads/etc., plot stress contours rather than factor of safety contours, and provide more contour levels (as the 4-color scale you're using treats a .99 FOS region as identical to a .01 FOS region).\n\nAll that said, I have no reason not to believe that the preload is too much for the aluminum plates. Remember that you can easily specify a bolt torque on your drawing if you need to reduce it. However, rather than a non-standard torque, a smaller bolt is often the better solution, even if you need more of them to get the job done. You should also evaluate if a larger washer would help, more surface area will reduce contact stress.

If the plate is pushing towards the boltheads then failure is likely the bolts ultimate strength. What is the loading conditions of the rest of the plate? \n\nBefore you go to simulation do some static analysis and figure out what the load is on the bolts.

In short, you'd never use an M8 bolt on an aluminium thread. \n\nWhat your simulation is telling you is that your bolt is stripping the threading of the aluminium. Specifically , that the plate can support only 0.035 times the load you are applying as preload. \n\nWhat you should do is, either, switch to higher strength aluminium, to a higher pitch thread and different type of thread, to a blind hole and bolt with a nut, to a threaded rivet made of steel or any viable combination of the above.\n\nedit: I see now your hole is blind and you have a nut...Switch to a higher strength aluminium, add a washer.

So depending on the yield strength used for mild steel by your CAD software, it is entirely possible that the safety factor will be lower.\n\nThis is the yield strength, not the ultimate strength.

It would be supporting either 5 of the  7' wide x 12' long retractable shades, or 8 of the 4' wide by 12' long retractable shades. The installation video doesn't seem to show them tensioning the tracks the shades run on terribly tightly. There is a fair bit of wind here. The plan would be to retract and secure the shades to the eaves of the house when it was windy, but nothing happens 100% of the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.) Would 6x6 posts work to do this, or is that inadequate or overkill? 4x4 strong enough?\n\n2.) What about metal posts? If I could have a hollowed receptacle in the concrete footer to slide a metal post into then I could remove the post and it and cap it over the winter when the rest of the apparatus comes down, so the posts aren't just hanging out there looking ugly.\n\n3.) How deeply into the ground should the post be set? Does attaching the post to the rim joist of the deck \\~3' 8\" above ground change that?", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "dipherent1", "comment_text": "What you're asking is not something someone can answer without doing work.

I'm concerned that I made the wrong decision. In my experience, the straight sided spline prints differed by not having a profile angle listed instead of a pressure angle.

Here are the questions:  \n1. Would it be wise to pursue this major/minor combo given the fact that engineering is known to be a difficult subject?  \n2. Would doing this combo look beneficial to interviewers?  \n3. Would doing this combo help me to learn more about semiconductors than just majoring in Materials Science?  \n4. Just in case I decide that semiconductors aren't for me later down the line, what are some other overlapping concepts/things between the worlds of Materials Science and Electrical Engineering to your knowledge?  \n5.
