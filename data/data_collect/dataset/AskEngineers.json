I have a Bachelor\u2019s in Civil Engineering Technology with a concentration/specialization in Structural. I\u2019ve been looking recently to move over to the UK/England.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to learn or figure out is what I should expect in the process of trying to move careers. Mainly how I should be applying to jobs and for a Visa. How do I apply to jobs? Do I need any special documentation or qualifications that aren\u2019t the typical job requirements? I already have my Civil FE. Does the firm/company need to be licensed with the UK government for a Visa or anything? With my little work experience and certifications or licenses what should I specifically search for in the Structural Engineering realm?\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated and welcomed.", "reply_created_utc": 1714467668.0}, {"index": "red0_s0_c2_", "comment_text": "As a reminder, /r/AskEngineers normal restrictions for career related posts are severely relaxed for this thread, so feel free to ask about intra-office politics, salaries, or just about anything else related to your job!", "comment_created_utc": 1714395652.0, "reply_text": "Hey guys,\n\nI'm currently exploring career options in the US that involve minimal computer time.

Just read some textbooks and execute (\"just\" he says\u2014it'd still be crazy hard and I highly respect the Indian Space Agency for their accomplishment). In order to beat another stealth fighter with one of your own, you have to be caught up with today's technology to even have a fighting chance of not getting blown out of the sky before you even see the enemy. In order to make a stealth fighter that can actually beat some other countries modern stealth fighter, you need to develop technology beyond what they have to get an edge. People in this comment section are right when they say landing on the moon is an incredible achievement, but it's that time sensitive competition that makes developing a stealth fighter so challenging, I feel.\n\nI argue that space specs and military specs are close enough to not be much of a contributing factor.

You can always [try to source the material yourself](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/rubber/rubber~/hardness~durometer-50a/material~neoprene/) and send it to your seal vendor.\n\nThe better answer is: how did you determine that you need 50A? Gasket seals are tricky, depending on what you're trying to seal, and if possible for your geometry I'd always recommend an O-ring. Much more predictable. Or an overmolded gasket. If you just have a uniform single-material sheet of foam/rubber/whatever, it may be more difficult to enforce a gap (unless your design accounts for this), and the parts being clamped may need to be much more rigid than you might think to make sure you get a consistent, even contact pressure around the entire gasket surface.\n\nKeep in mind that changing the durometer doesn't necessarily change the contact pressure in lockstep - it depends on the design and assembly. Do you have an enforced seal gap, or does the gasket set the gap and you're torquing bolts to a spec? You'll get different contact pressures in those two cases.\n\nSurface quality requirements tend to go down as you decrease durometer, as the seal is better able to fill out surface imperfections, but 50A and 60A is not a big difference, and some of that difference will be compensated for by the aforementioned (possible) increase in contact pressure. Your design probably isn't so borderline that 50A vs 60A is a make or break thing, but if it is you may want to consider that too.\n\nWithout more specific details it's hard to give more than generic advice.", "reply_created_utc": 1714506433.0}]}
