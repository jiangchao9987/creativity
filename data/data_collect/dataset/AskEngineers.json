This could result in the product not meeting safety standards required for use in certain industries or environments.\n\n>  Regulatory Non-Compliance: Using an invalid certification for a product can lead to regulatory non-compliance, which may result in penalties, fines, or legal consequences for the manufacturer or seller of the product.\n\n>  Risk to Safety: Testing a product outside of an NRTL's recognized scope could compromise safety standards. If the product is not adequately tested and certified according to relevant safety requirements, it could pose risks to users, workers, or the environment.\n\n> Loss of Reputation: For the NRTL itself, testing products outside of their recognized scope can damage their reputation and credibility. Stakeholders may lose trust in their testing and certification processes, impacting their ability to attract clients and maintain their status as a recognized testing laboratory.\n\n> In summary, it's crucial for manufacturers and NRTLs to ensure that products are tested and certified within the NRTL's recognized scope and expertise to avoid legal, safety, and reputational issues.\n\nI have not taken this to anyone in the company because I feel the need to understand the ramifications before raising the alarm.\n\nI did go to the OSHA website on the subject and verified that the lab we use is not recognized for the test they have authorized us to mark. \n\nIs there some workaround on the subject that I might be overlooking?\n\nEDIT: WTF is up with the downvotes?

OSHA approved NRTLs likely provide automatic/implied OSHA approval via their certification. But if the underlying requirement is to comply with the standard, then it's essentially at your risk that it complies. The [OSHA FAQ](https://www.osha.gov/nationally-recognized-testing-laboratory-program/frequently-asked-questions#employers_regulators) lists this question for example:\n\n> **Does OSHA have alternatives to NRTL \"approval\" of products?**\n> An NRTL must, with limited exception, certify products requiring \"approval\" by OSHA standards. For example, the OSHA standards addressing electrical hazards (subpart S of 29 CFR Part 1910) define the term \"approved\" as acceptable to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, and provide that equipment is acceptable to the Assistant Secretary of Labor:\n\n> If it is accepted, or certified, or listed, or labeled, or otherwise determined to be safe by a nationally recognized testing laboratory recognized pursuant to \u00a7 1910.7; or\n> With respect to an installation or equipment of a kind that no nationally recognized testing laboratory accepts, certifies, lists, labels, or determines to be safe, if it is inspected or tested by another Federal agency, or by a State, municipal, or other local authority responsible for enforcing occupational safety provisions of the National Electrical Code, and found in compliance with the provisions of the National Electrical Code as applied in this subpart; or\n> With respect to custom-made equipment or related installations that are designed, fabricated for, and intended for use by a particular customer, if it is determined to be safe for its intended use by its manufacturer on the basis of test data which the employer keeps and makes available for inspection to the Assistant Secretary and his authorized representatives.\n\nNote, that specific for stuff that needs to comply with that specific law (electrical safety), but they point out that it isn't actually required, the local government has the authority to approve it anyways which could mean it could be approved for use by your local inspector if they see the mark of an NRTL they are comfortable accepting. Likewise, for one off stuff, the company is allowed to do their own testing (such as send it off to the lab or their choice, such as their own lab, or whatever), and that go with that.\n\nNRTLs are there to reduce the paperwork basically, you use them, and their results are just considered \"good\" by law and their mark is automatically sufficient evidence. It's not however the only way to go about it, though if you don't use them, you may need a lot more stuff to sign off on it it's use (like showing the test results to the person inspecting it). The liability for a company would depends on what happened, did a company have someone deny some approval? Did they have damages that they want to sue you for? Did you say it's approved by OSHA, or did you say it's approved by the NRTL (which did say that?). If you didn't deceive your customers, it might not result in actual damage. And there may be alternative ways to get approval anyways (like showing test results from a non-approved lab).\n\nYou really do need to dig into the actual regulations, and determine what is actually required, and what's the actual approval requirements. Do not believe the OSHA website as the source of truth (the actual source of truth is federalregister.gov ).\n\nAnd yea, I understand you can't provide details, but without them we can't check the requirements.", "This is great, thanks. \n\nWhat I take from this is that even if the NRTL is not recognized for the specific test, if they performed it and were comfortable enough with the results and allowed us to use their mark, that is good enough. \n\nThere seems to be no legal requirement to use a recognized NRTL and as long as the local AHJ (electrical inspectors) accept the certification mark as evidence of meeting NEC code, that is good enough.", "It depends on what your product is.
