The senior one takes the 2 VPs with the largest project volume and one new guy who's doing really well. My lead was valedictorian of our graduating class, has years of experience as a lead forklift repair tech and brought me on when he was getting overwhelmed. I am good at what I do after a year of doing it, but have pretty severe ADHD, which is commented on often so I keep quiet in meetings. The VPs have said once or twice they wish that I was more like my lead. I try to follow directions exactly, but some times, when dealing with large amounts of data and multiple projects, I've made mistakes.\u00a0\n\n\nI take the projects of the last VP, and all the other sales reps (8 additional people). Other than the VP I work with (great at design and even better at selling, but I've caught a couple of issues before they came up so he's working closer with me. He's also the most junior VP and I wouldn't be surprised if he phrases it that he gets POs in spite of me rather than because of me), there's only one or two sellers that consistently gets POs.\n\n\nCompany higher ups have told us they're going to start laying off sales reps (almost certainly ones I work with)\u00a0\n\n\nThey're also semi-actively looking into hiring other engineers. The 2 VPs that work with my lead rarely talk to me/answer my emails when I'm giving them information on one of their projects I'm working for them.\u00a0\n\n\nDo I have to worry about being let go?\u00a0"}, {"comment_author": "Nervous_Award_3914", "comment_text": "Cant comment on being let go because it is hard to predict if you do.

This post is intended to provide an ongoing resource for job hunters to get an idea of the salary they should ask for based on location and job title. Survey responses are NOT vetted or verified, and should not be considered data of sufficient quality for statistical or other data analysis.\n\nSo what's the point of this survey? We hope that by collecting responses every quarter, job hunters can use it as a supplement to other salary data sites like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Glassdoor and PayScale to negotiate better compensation packages when they switch jobs.\n\n> [Archive of past surveys](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/search/?q=flair%3A%22salary+survey%22&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new)\n\n## Useful websites\n\nFor Americans, BLS is the gold standard when it comes to labor data. A guide for how to use BLS can be found in our wiki:\n\n* [*How do I figure out how much salary to ask for?

For example, the Canadian counterpart to BLS is [StatCan](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start), and [DE Statis](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Labour/Labour-Market/Employment/_node.html) for Germany.\n\n* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/member/home/index.htm)\n\n* [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/)\n\n# How to participate / Survey instructions\n\nA template is provided at the bottom of this post to standardize reporting total compensation from your job.

Under-head stress can be determined simply by calculating the force per unit contact area as others have said. Capability to resist load in a transverse direction can be done by simply applying a coefficient of friction to your clamping force. Appropriately conservative coefficients for different material couples can be found in Machinery's Handbook, Shigley's, or [other references](https://s3vi.ndc.nasa.gov/ssri-kb/static/resources/nasa-std-5020.pdf). These should also contain the basic steps to designing a bolted joint, which can be done on a hand calc basis for most normal applications. These hand calculations, when performed correctly, are a quicker and more correct way to design a basic bolted joint than a finite element model (especially for contact stress, which is a trivial calculation and is often incorrect in FEA)\n\nFEA is not a cure-all, and it will not provide you with useful results if you do not set it up correctly. Boundary conditions matter. Properly applied contacts and loads matter. Mesh quality matters. Correct model geometry matters. If you just throw a model together without understanding it, you will not get usable results. You should always verify your model with hand calculations - obviously you can't verify everything in it (the model would be pointless if you could), but the bulk phenomena can be checked to validate that your system is properly setup.\n\nLooking at your model results, the substantial asymmetry in the stress patterns suggests that your mesh is probably too coarse. You also look like you've simplified the connection of two plates into a single body, which I would not recommend given that you've said that the plates are loaded in shear. In the future when presenting FEA results, you should always show your mesh, show your boundary conditions/loads/etc., plot stress contours rather than factor of safety contours, and provide more contour levels (as the 4-color scale you're using treats a .99 FOS region as identical to a .01 FOS region).\n\nAll that said, I have no reason not to believe that the preload is too much for the aluminum plates. Remember that you can easily specify a bolt torque on your drawing if you need to reduce it. However, rather than a non-standard torque, a smaller bolt is often the better solution, even if you need more of them to get the job done. You should also evaluate if a larger washer would help, more surface area will reduce contact stress.

I don't know what your safety factor is set too, but the compressive yield strength of 6061 aluminium is higher than its tensile strength. A quick calculation will give you the expected average stress in MPa under the washers of your bolt:\n\n23200 N / 75 mm\u00b2 = 310 MPa < 386 MPa (see bearing yield strength [ASM Matweb](https://asm.matweb.com/search/SpecificMaterial.asp?bassnum=ma6061t6))\n\nThis is the average compressive load the washer puts on the aluminium, so there may be some local deformation but the connection should be fine under static load. This also means the stress value under the middle (at a radius of 6.1 mm) of the washer should roughly match this value. If that is the case at least the average value of your stress calculation is correct, otherwise there is something wrong with your FEA setup.\n\nIf cyclic loading or fatigue are a concern you'll want to look into this more carefully and consider using larger washers to distribute the preloading better or you should consider lowering the pretension on the bolt and using more bolts. \n\nAlso the Length/diameter-ratio of your connection is too low: \nL/D < 3\nSo setting will (likely) reduce your preload unless the bolts are retightened after a while.\n\nThe peak stresses that you're seeing here in the simulation likely aren't there in real life, this is because for local (peak) stresses you'll need a finer mesh to get accurate results.\n\nI hope this helps you get some more insight into FEA calculations, you really cannot take any result at face value and a manual calculation is always necessary to check the results for accuracy.

I think the result is due to fusion freaked out because theres an edge contact and a right angle there.

In short, you'd never use an M8 bolt on an aluminium thread. \n\nWhat your simulation is telling you is that your bolt is stripping the threading of the aluminium.

We live near a granite quarry that produces gravel products and one material they sell is called \"M-10\" which is basically the quarry fines from about 10mm to dust. \n\nI have read an article from the concrete sub that talked about 2 ways to utilize quarry fines in concrete. Way #1 was to sub a portion of the sand for the fine dust which lead to higher strength concrete due to the fines filling in the voids in the sand. Option #2 was utilizing fines to reduce the cement needed while still achieving the same strength in the mix.\n\nHere's my questions:\n\n1. Does anyone have any experience with something like this?\n2. Has anyone ever seen any mix designs I could take to my local plant for them to follow?\n3. Any recommendations on what testing, tools for site testing of batches, or admixtures for pouring vertical and horizontal slabs with the quarry fines. \n\nAny other suggestions are greatly appreciated, especially books to read to dig deeper into the subject.\n\nThanks in advance ", "post_comments": []}, {"post_title": "Fibre Installation Gone Wrong - How dangerous?", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1byy08h/fibre_installation_gone_wrong_how_dangerous/", "post_main_text": "Pic1 - Openreach (UK) engineer went though a main wire from main fuse.
