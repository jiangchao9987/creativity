Consider the weight of the sections:\r  \n   \\- Evaluate how important that particular section is relative to the others. If it's a crucial foundational piece, it may be worth prioritizing it, even if it means sacrificing some time in other areas.\r  \n   \\- On the other hand, if the section is less heavily weighted, it may make sense to move on and come back to it later.\r  \n\r  \n3. Manage your time efficiently:\r  \n   \\- With only 10-12 days left, you'll need to be very strategic about how you allocate your time.\r  \n   \\- If you've already spent 4 days longer than planned on that one section, it may be better to move on and cover the remaining material, rather than risk falling behind on the other sections.\r  \n\r  \n4. Take breaks and revisit:\r  \n   \\- If you decide to move on, you could still come back to the challenging section later, after you've covered the other material.\r  \n   \\- Taking a break and returning to it with fresh eyes might help you break through the mental block.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, it's a balancing act. My recommendation would be to:\r  \n\r  \nA) Spend a bit more time trying to understand the challenging section, but set a clear time limit (e.g., another 1-2 hours).\r  \nB) If you still feel stuck, move on to the other sections, making a note to come back to the difficult section later.\r  \nC) Regularly review your progress and consider adjusting your plan as needed.\r  \n\r  \nThe key is to be flexible, focus on the sections that will have the greatest impact, and don't get too bogged down in one area at the expense of the others.

There is nothing more important than your mental health. If that doesn\u2019t work then be nicer to yourself. You probably expect much of yourself as you mentioned that you could go on for 10 hours. Take it one step at a time. Set mini goals every day. Tell yourself today I\u2019m gonna study these many minutes (yes start at minutes).

So helpful for days where it\u2019s hard to do self care or you feel like you\u2019re running behind. I\u2019d recommend fiber snacks or fruit snacks; something easy on your stomach. \n\n- Pomodoro apps or videos on YouTube help tremendously with getting stuff done when I\u2019m in a rut. I\u2019ve felt so burnt out with grad school and have seen my motivation spiral and pomodoro have saved me. I also recommend the Study Bunny app on iPhone. I have a pomodoro app on my laptop where it keeps track of the minutes I spent studying (and I like it just bc I like tracking stuff). \n\n- get out of the house to study. Go to a place with sunshine and either take snacks or make sure it\u2019s a place you can buy something to eat or drink you like. Even if you only study for 30 minutes or 4 hours. Every bit counts!

It\u2019s not always easy but on some days where I feel like absolute sh-t I will carve out time to do my eyeshadow and make my hair look decent. It\u2019s a great opportunity to express my creativity, practice mindfulness and enjoy the time using different colors. Doing this helps me feel a little bit more enthused and confident about the day, even if I know I\u2019m still not feeling 100%. \n\n- call or text someone close to you, a safe person, you know you can confide in about your symptoms. Again, I don\u2019t know you personally, but I know for me being able to be honest with someone and not mask helps me feel less alone and like I don\u2019t have to be so hard on myself.

I applied for ba psy at york and bsc in others. I am still waiting for UCL but the problem is these colleges are highly expensive for international student. I have no option in my home country and I do need to select one from the above. York is cheaper as it has more scholarship opportunities but it's also not well known and i have heard mixed review about it. So should I choose an expensive school or an affordable one with low ranking. Also is it worth it to spend huge amount on psy undergrad degree.\nAlso which option is better in terms of career opportunities and money from the below 1.Psychology\n2.Information Technology \n3.Business management\n4.Political Sciences", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "Unicorn-ups", "comment_text": "Choose somewhere u can get your bsc..especially if considering clinical work post grad"}]}, {"post_title": "About my study plan", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/1bya8fz/about_my_study_plan/", "post_main_text": "Hi everyone!\nI have exams coming up in six weeks that could change my current degree, but I haven't been preparing adequately for them because they seem relatively easy. However, I now realize the importance of thorough preparation, especially since I need to balance studying for these exams with my current degree. I'm considering a plan to study for at least 14 hours every week, totaling 84 hours in six weeks, trying to dedicate 2 hours at least each day, but I'm unsure if this plan is effective. Additionally, I have exams in three different subjects: math, physics, and chemistry. Any advice on how to stay disciplined and organized while preparing for these exams, especially with the need to juggle multiple subjects alongside my current coursework and part-time job?\nI get panic attacks just thinking about it, or when I actually start studying I get overwhelmed and stop.\n\nThank you in advance!", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "joecarrow24", "comment_text": "Hey there! It sounds like a solid plan, but don't forget to break down your study sessions into focused chunks with short breaks in between\u2014this can enhance concentration and retention. For balancing multiple subjects, consider a rotating schedule to keep things fresh and prevent burnout. Also, integrating your subjects with your part-time job, if possible, could provide practical application and reinforcement. Remember, quality over quantity counts in studying. Take care of yourself during this time and good luck!"}, {"comment_author": "EuphoriaMeow", "comment_text": "Thank you so much for the advice!!!!

Once it has that, you can also upload your textbook and lecture notes etc. Then it goes about planning a schedule for you to study, go to class, and do assignments. Would this help you as a student?
