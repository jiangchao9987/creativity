Often, those 5 minutes turn into a productive study session.\n* **Break it Down:**\u00a0Large tasks can be overwhelming. Chunk your studying into smaller, more manageable sections. Focus on one concept at a time.\n* **Change Your Environment:** Try studying in a different location like a library, coffee shop, or even outside (weather permitting!).\n* **Find a Study Buddy:**\u00a0Studying with a friend or classmate can keep you accountable and make the process more engaging.\n\nYou can also join our community at\u00a0[](https://www.reddit.com/r/911papers_homworkhelp/)\u00a0for more tips and also to connect with other students who share similar academic experiences.\n\n[911papers.com](http://911papers.com/)"}, {"comment_text": "*image is copied ", "reply_text": "I often use a 30-minutes rule to overcome lack of motivation.

Maybe this is just an emotional post . But f**k it man , we ball . I hate myself and now it's time to change this situation. I know even if I give myself 1 year properly I can recover from a lot of damage I have done to myself over the years . It will be tough but it will be worth it . Have a tough exam coming up in 4 months (usually requires 8 months of prep but as you can guess I procrastinated and will face consequences now ) , I will try to go beast mode if I can . I may fail again but I have to get better even if it's by 10% because I have been at 0% for past 6-7 years . I am just stuck in my mind all the time . Now it's time to get this done .

For our course we have to study systematic anatomy, and I currently find it very difficult and just did a test, which I\u2019m praying to God I passed (x=>50%).

I\u2019m a first year and I feel like I\u2019m being overwhelmed with content, and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll survive the next three years. Back in high school, I was competently academic and got good enough scores to get into top 2% of my state without really studying much, even in finals. I did 3-4 hours of study for the anatomy test and I\u2019m unsure if I pass or not. I\u2019m barely getting by in my classes and sudden drop in my academic progress is really coming as a shock to me.

You're going to have to learn to put more time into study. So when you are learning material it's normal to forget things the first time you are introduced to them. Repetition exposure helps to deeply ingrain memories. \n\nI would try going to a place to study a few hours a day: library, cafe, park, whichever you prefer. Do a quick overview of things you've learned, plus whatever homework you have. Then you can focus on really reviewing material more deeply. Remember you don't have to learn everything the first time, just introducing yourself and exposing yourself to it helps if you keep it up almost every day. \n\nIf it's something like anatomy: the first step would be just reading the names and locations, next session you could do more review and maybe test your memory of locations. Remember it doesn't have to be perfect. Then about 15 minutes later try again, then again. Over time you will see you are making progress.
