Ok so super random but I have a study tool for students with ADHD. I think it would also help you as well as students with ADHD have a dopamine deficiency in their brain which can cause extreme procrastination to the point of task paralysis. The tool is called Kumo Study on the chrome store (totally free to use).\n\n  \nSo would I would recommend using the customisable Pomodoro Timer to chunk down your day into smaller pieces. So basically, I would start with 18mins work/7mins rest. If you feel like that is manageable and you have found some flow I would move onto sets of 45mins work/10mins rest. or 52mins work 8 mins of rest.\n\nIf you are really having a day that you feel like you can't get started - move up in really small increments. So:  \n-5mins work/5mins rest\n\n-6mins work/5mins rest\n\n-7mins work/5mins rest\n\nand work up until you get to a point that feels too long to stay focused. For example: you get to 21mins and it feels like you can't stay focused that long: work back down:  \n-21mins work - 5mins rest\n\n-20mins work - 5mins rest\n\n-19mins work - 5mins rest\n\nLet me know how you go!"}, {"comment_author": "Dr_Cristie", "comment_text": "Many students have this problem, it seems like getting started is the hardest part. Try getting a study buddy/productivity partner. Focusmate is a good service and they have up to a certain number of free sessions a week (I forget how many). You sign up for an appointment and are paired with another study buddy who is also looking for that extra oomph to get started. Knowing that someone is waiting for you is a great motivator.\n\nI also recommend the 15-minute rule. In the morning, sit down and promise yourself that you will put in just 15 minutes. 15 minutes is less than 1% of your day, I'm sure you can manage to give 1% of your day to studying. If, at the end of the 15 minutes you are still struggling then stop. You gave it a fair shake. Try again later that afternoon. But here's the key, when I say stop if you are still struggling, you need to stop. It only works if you keep the promise to stop and not try to force it. More times than not, you'll get into the flow but on those days that you don't then you do need to walk away.\n\nFinally, be sure to make your study plan concrete and measurable. Tasks like \"read the first two sections of Chapter 3\" or \"complete one of the three practice questions.\" One of the reasons your brain doesn't want to start studying is because \"I'm going to study\" is a huge, uncertain concept. It feels never-ending. There's a nice bit of dopamine you can get from completing a task but \"studying\" could have no end. Turn your study plan into a series of checklists to make it feel more manageable and give you more dopamine."}]}, {"post_title": "the overwhelming feeling and needing to be great, is this normal?

However, here are a few factors to consider:\r  \n\r  \n1. Assess your level of understanding:\r  \n   \\- If you're truly stuck and feel like you're not making any meaningful progress on that section, despite your efforts, it may be more productive to move on for now.\r  \n   \\- However, if you feel like you're on the cusp of understanding and just need a little more time and focus, it could be worth persisting.\r  \n\r  \n2. Consider the weight of the sections:\r  \n   \\- Evaluate how important that particular section is relative to the others. If it's a crucial foundational piece, it may be worth prioritizing it, even if it means sacrificing some time in other areas.\r  \n   \\- On the other hand, if the section is less heavily weighted, it may make sense to move on and come back to it later.\r  \n\r  \n3. Manage your time efficiently:\r  \n   \\- With only 10-12 days left, you'll need to be very strategic about how you allocate your time.\r  \n   \\- If you've already spent 4 days longer than planned on that one section, it may be better to move on and cover the remaining material, rather than risk falling behind on the other sections.\r  \n\r  \n4. Take breaks and revisit:\r  \n   \\- If you decide to move on, you could still come back to the challenging section later, after you've covered the other material.\r  \n   \\- Taking a break and returning to it with fresh eyes might help you break through the mental block.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, it's a balancing act. My recommendation would be to:\r  \n\r  \nA) Spend a bit more time trying to understand the challenging section, but set a clear time limit (e.g., another 1-2 hours).\r  \nB) If you still feel stuck, move on to the other sections, making a note to come back to the difficult section later.\r  \nC) Regularly review your progress and consider adjusting your plan as needed.\r  \n\r  \nThe key is to be flexible, focus on the sections that will have the greatest impact, and don't get too bogged down in one area at the expense of the others.

No need to look anywhere else; our holiday workshops are here for you to cover it all, yielding communication skills, an influx of confidence, and creativity. This is how your child can benefit from our workshops:  \n  \nIntroduction to Effective Communication  \n  \n  \nWorkshop attendance is highly recommended as it serves as a very useful introductory course before your child's participation in our weekly classes, which provide them with a wide range of strategies that will help them become better communicators. Relying on the involvement of activities, workshops, and experiential sessions, the kids will acquire the knowledge to speak in public in both academic and real-life environments.  \n  \n  \nElevate Public Speaking Skills  \n  \n  \nBy targeting audience interaction, our workshops have an explicit notion of hoisting your own child's public speaking skills to a higher level. From a persuasive speech for delivery or a project presentation to debating, students will know how to maintain their audience's attention, thus delivering their message clearly and confidently.  \n  \n  \nAdaptability in Public Speaking  \n  \n  \nIn modern times, where change is the name of the game, conventional public speaking norms are becoming a thing of the past and paving the way for innovative and authentic means of communication. We tailored our workshops to be exactly related to this matter, in which your child will learn the skills of how to add his unique style to his speaking while keeping his success in the points he wants to make in every presentation.  \n  \n  \nIgnite Intellectual Curiosity  \n  \n  \nThe public speaking training workshops we plan, will allow your child to enrich their knowledge by fuelling curiosity and exploring novel things. Thus, we do not only stimulate them to explore the well-expressed ideas of others but to synthesize their thinking and to conceptualize the content of the expression as well. As a result, the youngsters become the engines of change; critical thinking and reasoning become the skills that they gradually master.  \n  \n  \nPersonalized Mentorship  \n  \n  \nAt our workshops, students will learn to convey their message as the audience can become a great self-guide and also get acquainted with their particular advantages. Our experienced coaches will be working collaboratively with them, assessing their weaknesses, and providing exclusive guidance every step of the way.  \n  \n  \nSpark Creative Passion  \n  \n  \nApart from a speech, we also pull out the online creative writing workshop of your child and let them explore themselves and what they like. With online creative writing classes and through interactive activities, the students will be able to discover their own beautiful voice and speaking style, which is going to help boost their confidence for the future.  \n  \n  \nConclusion  \n  \n  \nDeveloping your child's communication skills and encouraging his creativity is a gift you can present that cannot be doubled. Our holiday workshops provide a vigorous and engaging learning platform that equips children with the ability to articulate well, reason, and eventually manifest the totality of their greatness. Through the support and knowledge of our seasoned mentors, your child can boost their confidence and take away a lot of important lessons for the future.  \n  \n  \n\n\n\u00a0", "post_comments": []}, {"post_title": "Pleasure", "post_url": "https://i.redd.it/i15xyuf4v0tc1.jpeg", "post_main_text": "", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "Ok-Foundation-7447", "comment_text": "Well, that's my job-"}, {"comment_author": "InformationFair4396", "comment_text": "Tbh I miss Math."}, {"comment_author": "pageyboy335", "comment_text": "Got to college and do a degree in mathematics if you think that would be better."}, {"comment_author": "InformationFair4396", "comment_text": "Who will earn for me then lol"}, {"comment_author": "pageyboy335", "comment_text": "I don't get what you mean, but if you are meaning who would pay you, you could technically get a career from a degree in mathematics.

I\u2019m not sure my tips will be helpful but I\u2019m gonna write them anyways because it\u2019s better than not. I\u2019m just gonna tell you how I manage when feeling down. It\u2019s not depression so I can\u2019t imagine how you\u2019re feeling. When I don\u2019t feel like studying I try to remind myself of why I study. And when I feel down studying helps distracting me from my emotions. Now that\u2019s very different from depression. I would suggest you try to get better by seeking professional help. There is nothing more important than your mental health. If that doesn\u2019t work then be nicer to yourself. You probably expect much of yourself as you mentioned that you could go on for 10 hours. Take it one step at a time. Set mini goals every day. Tell yourself today I\u2019m gonna study these many minutes (yes start at minutes). And then you can gradually increase it because you will for 1. Feel better through achieving goals 2. Slowly but surely be able to study more and more and regain your old habit. And it\u2019s completely normal and okay if you one day don\u2019t achieve what you expected to. Don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. I hope and pray that it will get better.

As someone who's dyslexic I'm pretty sure it's not an efficient/effective method to do 5+ hours without breaks.\n\nAnyhow, what I do is make flashcards on Quizlet and then move them over to Knowt (what quizlet used to be before they started asking you pay for stuff). Although I do prefer flashcard mode on quizlet, but I prefer the 'learn mode' on Knowt which is quite good for active recall.\n\nThen if I'm still unsure on a topic I see if there's anything on youtube / or any academic papers which explain it better, and make a physical A3 /A4 posters as it helps to map things out.\n\nIf you have any practice papers or example questions, definitely do those and see if you can answer those questions in mock exam conditions in your room just to practice.\n\nGood luck!"}, {"comment_author": "jvmpfrog", "comment_text": "This is something I struggled with for a long time. What I did to help me is download the app Forest, a pomodoro timer app that will block you from accessing apps on your phone that will not help you with your studies.

This small little reward system made a huge difference for me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdditionally, I will do only 1-2 assignments per day so I don't get burnt out. I started studying on FaceTime with someone so that I am held accountable, and someone sees that I'm working. Then, at the end of our session we discuss what we accomplished, and how that compared to our daily goal/plan. This way, you're able to see how much you can accomplish without getting burnt out and set tangible goals for yourself moving forward. If you don't have anyone to study with, I highly recommend just going on YouTube and putting on a video of someone studying ([pike channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pikechannel) is my favorite!) just to get the ambiance."}, {"comment_author": "Revolutionary-Sky758", "comment_text": "I'm really sorry you're struggling with severe depression and finding it so difficult to motivate yourself to study.

I don\u2019t know your medical situation but I know therapy and medication tremendously helps me cope. It doesn\u2019t fix everything but helps me stay at a reasonable baseline. \n\nLittle things that help me with depression:\n\n- keep depression snacks in your room or backpack. So helpful for days where it\u2019s hard to do self care or you feel like you\u2019re running behind. I\u2019d recommend fiber snacks or fruit snacks; something easy on your stomach. \n\n- Pomodoro apps or videos on YouTube help tremendously with getting stuff done when I\u2019m in a rut. I\u2019ve felt so burnt out with grad school and have seen my motivation spiral and pomodoro have saved me. I also recommend the Study Bunny app on iPhone. I have a pomodoro app on my laptop where it keeps track of the minutes I spent studying (and I like it just bc I like tracking stuff). \n\n- get out of the house to study. Go to a place with sunshine and either take snacks or make sure it\u2019s a place you can buy something to eat or drink you like. Even if you only study for 30 minutes or 4 hours. Every bit counts! It\u2019s very unhelpful to think in an all or nothing mindset\n\n- do something nice for yourself, something small. It\u2019s not always easy but on some days where I feel like absolute sh-t I will carve out time to do my eyeshadow and make my hair look decent. It\u2019s a great opportunity to express my creativity, practice mindfulness and enjoy the time using different colors. Doing this helps me feel a little bit more enthused and confident about the day, even if I know I\u2019m still not feeling 100%. \n\n- call or text someone close to you, a safe person, you know you can confide in about your symptoms. Again, I don\u2019t know you personally, but I know for me being able to be honest with someone and not mask helps me feel less alone and like I don\u2019t have to be so hard on myself. I used to have a really great friend who used to let me go over to her house anytime to get work done or to have a nice meal whenever my anxiety felt like too much. \n\nYou\u2019re welcome to DM me if I can help with anything else.

I am so sorry you are going through this. Super random, but I have a study tool for students with ADHD that might actually help you as well. Students with ADHD have a dopamine deficiency in their brain which makes it really hard for them to focus and they can get really easily overwhelmed and stressed.  \nIt is called Kumo Study and you can find it on the chrome store.

My tool has a customisable study timer and basically what I would recommend is doing: 5x8mins on 4 minutes off until you get some flow. If you feel like you can do longer than that maybe try 45mins of work/10mins of rest or 52mins work/8mins rest.\n\nSometimes if I am not sure how I am feeling, I will do 5mins work/5mins rest - 6mins work/5mins rest - 7mins work/5mins of rest until I get to a time that feels too long for me and then I work back down.
