["Hello college students, high-schoolers, educators, and everyone in between whose used r/GetStudying,\n\nThank you for 2 million members! This subreddit was created to help connect motivated learners, and help inspire those who were ready to achieve the best they academically could. While education can be a hindrance for some, this subreddit has helped so many people do great things, and we hope this subreddit helped contribute to academic success in some way.\n\nFrom the Moderation team, thank you so much. We never would've imagined having this many people in our subreddit, but we're thankful to everyone for all their help. Onto the next milestone!\n\nAs our subreddit continues to grow, we're looking for moderators to help with the community.

This is the Accountability Thread where people can list what they need or want to accomplish today and have everyone else help keep you accountable to do them. So, in general, a post will look like this:\n\nThings I have to get done today:\n\n~~1: Post Accountability Thread~~\n\nIf I had more to do that I had not completed I would list them and update this when these things were complete.\n\nAlso, if I saw someone doing something that I happen to be well-educated or have some sort of expertise in I can offer support or help on the topic/task.\n\nThe thread is a versatile one, use it in a way that helps you and others stay on task!\n\nHappy studying!", "It's my anniversary today!

You can also use flashcards to help you, but I recommend not creating them manually because it takes too much time.", "Maybe try teaching others, or even group studying and discussions around the topics. Sometimes the little 'mini traumas' we face when trying to speak to others or getting them to speak can help cement some topics. The idea here is that when you try to teach others you immediately find gaps in your knowledge. It is the making of connections that creates long-term memory.\n\nAnd with flashcards, like u/Darcron_ suggested, don't just fill in the blanks, but turn statements into questions. If you have access to an LLM, get the LLM to ask you questions and evaluate your answers critically.\n\nWhat works for me (these things) might not work for you but it's good to at least try new things if your current system seems ineffective.", "> This is why I do fantastic on weekly quizzes and horrible on exams covering previous content\n\nYou cannot explain something that you don't remember. Even when you might be able to \"explain\" something at the first question that goes outside the rails you might find yourself incapable to answer because you have not actually memorized the concept.\n\nIf you want to memorize things long term, my recommendation is always using flahscards. Anki is amazing if you want to invest the time and you are able to build the habit. If you want to speed things up with flashcards we are working on [flashka.ai](http://flashka.ai) which makes flashcards and quizzes automatically from PDFs and text, and there are many other similar alternatives popping out like that!\n\nGood luck!", "Help I desperately want to learn. I'm autistic and have ADHD, I know great combinations struggle to retain information and am very slow at processing things. I have however found a few things that work but the problem is they are for very specific subjects. The first thing is Duolingo and babble. The gamified method really works for me, giving me information and then working on slowly memorising it with pictures, sound and repetition. I have tried similar quiz apps but they just don't work very well for me. Duolingo is almost more childlike, I don't really know how to explain it. The other application I love is Endless Quiz, this is a real confidence booster because it shows me how much knowledge I have tucked away in my brain in my subconscious, I think that's the right word. I want to learn paramedic science but I just can't seem to find anything that works in the same way. It's too much information that I need breaking down which I can't do. That's my problem, it's funny how I only discovered how much I loved learning after leaving the education system."]
