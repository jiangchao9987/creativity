Because digestion is a humongous task your body does, it requires a lot of energy. This can directly affect your sleep, which in turn affects how dull or fresh you feel in the morning. Here are 3 tips that will make it easier for you to wake up in the morning. \n\nChew your food. Sounds simple, but it isn\u2019t. Our digestion process starts from our mouth itself, where the digestive enzymes in our saliva are supposed to break our food down, and our stomach is expecting this half digested food. This way, the energy required by our stomach for digestion will be significantly less. But let\u2019s face it, most of us don\u2019t chew enough, and this is why this is the very first tip. \n\nDon\u2019t stuff yourself with food. This is plain and simple - if you\u2019re overeating, your stomach hates you for making it work overtime! Don\u2019t starve yourself obviously, but also don\u2019t eat like a pig! Interestingly enough, chewing your food well will naturally make sure you don\u2019t eat too much, because we only have so much patience to chew so much food, right?\n\nDon\u2019t Sleep Right After You Eat.  You will observe that our body becomes dull right after we eat. So it may make sense to make use of that dullness and sleep right away. Well, not if you want to get up feeling fresh in the morning! If you keep sufficient gap, where this temporary dullness caused by food has subsided, and then sleep, you will see you will feel much more fresh in the morning when your alarm rings. So have a gap of around 2 hours between dinner and sleep.\n\nMy experience with these tips : So I heard about these tips from Sadhguru last week, and after giving it some thought I was like \u201cwhy not?\u201d. I decided I\u2019ll do it for a week. I'm still baffled to say that I woke up at 5, four times this week! It\u2019s a pretty huge deal for me! I won\u2019t lie though, it feels weird, because I am used to going to bed feeling absolutely dull and sleepy. But I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m able to experience that morning high again!", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "your-so-skibidii", "comment_text": "I\u2019m eating wrong \n\nI\u2019m sleeping wrong \n\nI\u2019m drinking wrong \n\nI\u2019m shitting wrong \n\nEveryday I see posts on reddit or youtube telling me I\u2019m doing almost everything wrong."}, {"comment_author": "zerry47", "comment_text": "I think you also breathe wrong if you do it from your mouth"}, {"comment_author": "Koltaia30", "comment_text": "All you had to do was eat shit sleep.

Schedule in 9 hours for it if you need lots of sleep like me. You'll often end up sleeping only 7,5 hours of it anyway. On the topic of health, eating and drinking healthy enough and working out add to your vitality and help achieve flow through a healthy body and mind.\n\n\n- Assign a physical place to your task that needs flow.

Again as a kid and teen I would often go to sleep very late or even have all nighters. Some time ago I developed a habit of going to sleep very early, like 7pm. I know this might be a bit extreme for some but personally I really like sleeping and also sleep for like 10-12 hours so it's important for me to get a full rest.\n\n* **Spending less time on phone and computer**. Spending less time on social media and videogames has drastically improved my mental health. The most valuable thing I got from it is getting my time back. Nowadays when I play a game or sit on my phone for too long I get this itchy urge like \"Why am I wasting my time on this, I should go do something productive!\", whereas when I still had the addiction it was the opposite - \"I need more time to finish this level!\"\n\n* **Staying clean and tidy**. When I was a kid I really hated baths/showers and cleaning up my room. Sometime during my teens I started loving them and developed a habit and affection for staying clean and tidy.

Ik it sounds silly but stay with me \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f with the meat, that\u2019s kind of all your tasks and obligations so you\u2019re supposed to build 6 different types of days so that when you wake up you can ask yourself \u201cokay what type of sandwich day am I having?\u201d And choose one of the 6 that suits your day best. The cheese is for unwinding like I said, so you essentially write down things that you enjoy that relax you and schedule a time for them after the meat. They didn\u2019t talk about this in the video, but I broke down my cheese into 3 categories: energy givers, neutral, and energy takers. For example, social media time would be an energy taker, TV would be neutral, and drawing would be a giver. I like to pick a couple from different categories to get a balance in my day so I don\u2019t spend all my relaxation time on instagram lol! The two slices of bread basically are for the things that you always do in the morning (wake up brush your teeth make coffee etc.) and at night (wash your face, change, typical bedtime routine stuff). Lastly, there\u2019s \u201cpotato days\u201d as the video put it, where you create a type of day for stuff that you like (not necessarily meant to relax you like the cheese) this could be hiking, traveling, seeing friends etc.) \n\nOnce I have all my sandwich ingredients ready, I wake up in the morning and fill out a small column for every category. Today\u2019s example would be\u2026\nbread: at 9am, make coffee, make my bed, plan day. \nMeat: chore/ menial task day: clean bathroom, review flash cards, etc. \ncheese: work on manuscript, watch tv, social media. \nSleep: skincare, shower, etc. \n\nSorry that\u2019s a lot I didn\u2019t realize till I was nearly done typing \ud83d\ude2d but I hope that makes a little bit of sense?"}, {"comment_author": "kram--", "comment_text": "Oh i love this question.

This method was inspired by how telephones at the time used magnets to create vocal vibrations!\n2. **Learn current events:** Ernie Ball Music Man just launched The Custom Design Experience, which lets you make a custom 4 or 5-string bass guitar, which is similar to the Fender Mod Shop for custom guitars (which has like over 70,000 combinations available, lol).  Pretty neat option for a highly personalized instrument!\n3. **Learn something new:** Could be a technique, or learn how a piece of hardware works, or learn more about a particular musician, etc.\n4. **Do something new:** Try out a new song or a new technique.

So it became impossible to do anything at all. I just had to realize that no one else is in my head, only I am.
