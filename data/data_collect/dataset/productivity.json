I have to stop using it for various reasons. I just need a program to store and categorize notes, journals, creative writing, knowledge and thoughts. I don't use it for anything fancy, just writing text notes, sorting them and tagging them. I like Joplin since it reminds me of the Evernote of old, just clean, straightforward and efficient. But it lacks nested tags/ subtags (however you want to call them) which are extremely helpful for what I use(d) Evernote for, the thing that separates it from my old way of doing things with txt files in folders. I know that I can just DIY them by creating tags like \"tag:subtag:subsubtag\" but that is so messy. Is there a program that could work for me? There seems to be so many now. Joplin would have been perfect if not for the lack of nested tags. Thank you!", "reply_created_utc": 1714506039.0}]}

Before social media we didn't do that...\u00a0 I have a family text chat where we all text each other happy birthday and share various family news sometimes. The people who matter will remain in communication. They will send pics of their experiences. The \"influencers\" don't really have anything important to say at the end of the day. They make money off your attention. YouTube is just as useful for information imo Live your life. Don't watch other people live theirs. Edit to add: I may or may not be more productive. I wrote a book! But I also just have more peace of mind and don't play the comparison game nearly as much... When I'm lonely, I turn on the TV or call a relative... Or hug my dog lol... I also read.

Also, it needs to be available immediately. So for example, going for a run is great but it's not always accessible, but Wordle game is.

I used to be on Facebook & Instagram 24/7, but I don\u2019t know\u2026 One day I just had a change of heart and found the whole thing so cringe. Just the idea of posting pictures of myself with a little caption for basically no reason other than trying to show off to people I mostly don\u2019t even talk to anymore\u2026 I just got the ick with myself lol. And I slowly stopped using those apps. \n\nI do still have accounts and will look on my feed maybe once or twice every couple weeks, just to keep up with family that I don\u2019t see on a regular basis. I don\u2019t post anything at all, and I rarely comment on anything unless a family member tags me or wishes me a happy birthday or something. So I\u2019m not completely off the apps, but it\u2019s a huge difference from how frequently I used to use them. I\u2019ve found that I am much more focused on my own life/goals/interests now that I\u2019m not interacting with other people\u2019s as much, and I no longer feel paranoid that people can just look through years of my history on an app \ud83d\ude2d (I\u2019ve also made all of my accounts private and deleted a lot of embarrassing things). \n\nAs far as what I do instead, I will admit that I have a Tiktok account where I watch videos, and of course there\u2019s reddit. I also have a couple of phone and Xbox games that I play. But all of these, while still being on my phone, are way less consuming and embarrassing than Instagram/Facebook used to be. Not to mention it\u2019s way easier to just not engage with negative content that I don\u2019t want to see (This was not the case with Facebook & Instagram\u2026 If a family member was spewing hateful bullshit, I had to decide whether to remove them & risk drama or just deal with seeing their shitty takes 24/7).

They treat people unfairly based on politics. Reddit is unfair too, but I don't care anymore. I don't really get into discussions anymore because I feel like most posters are bots anyways, and I don't care to change people's opinions on issues because that never works on me. I just comment and then turn off replies when I'm done wasting energy. \n\nSocial media is dying, most of it is garbage, and I don't think it will be around in the future because it was just a social experiment to begin with. Government and corporate manipulation destroyed whatever social media could have been. It has sunk so low that we now have presidents (Biden) paying Only Fans influencers to promote their campaigns. \n\nYou don't need social media, no one does, just like you don't need heroin or crack.

When I use it less, it's surprising how noticeably more calm and relaxed I feel. It probably affects people differently, but for me, social media consistently makes me feel anxious. \n\nIt almost sounds like you are experiencing a type of withdrawal since installing your app blocker. It will probably be tough in the beginning, but if you stick with it, those \"craving\" feelings you're describing should subside. It may be helpful to consider replacing that \"craving\" with another (healthier) hobby - something real-world and not related to anything online. \n\nIt can be anything you love doing, or maybe a new hobby you want to try. :) Maybe taking a walk outside, trying a new dish to cook, reading a new book, exercising a bit, or a new skill you have always wanted to learn! Good luck and I wish you the best with reducing your social media time. :)\n\nOh, I realize I didn't actually answer the question - what helped me the most was turning off **ALL** my notifications. Both on mobile and desktop. (On desktop, I use the Windows \"silent\" or \"do not disturb\" mode - this turns off all notifications.) \n\nFor me, I found it was the notifications that distracted me the most, and not social media itself as much. That's why I have not had to \"quit\" social media or use an app blocker - with notifications off, it has to be a conscious choice for me to look at social media now. Which makes it easier for me to choose not to do so, or only do so on my schedule. \n\nThose notifications are intentionally designed to be addictive (they provide a slight hit of dopamine). Turn them off, and it should be easier (over time) to not feel as \"addicted\" to checking them.\n\n**Edit:** I just remembered! I also read a book exactly about how social media is deliberately designed to be addictive, and make you feel the \"craving\" you're experiencing - learning more about that helped me so much with seeing when this was being done by social media sites. Which made it so much easier for me to not allow that to happen. The book is \"Indistractable\" by Nir Eyal. The author previously wrote a how-to book on how to make addicting apps. Maybe he felt some guilt over it, because *Indistractable* is basically a guide for how to not become addicted to apps, haha.", "reply_created_utc": 1714500920.0}, {"index": "red5_s2_c109_", "comment_text": "Im 34 F , I struggle big time with social media addiction to the point I put an app to block some websites on my computer to help me with productivity.

I learned Python for three months, and JavaScript for another three months. didn't liked any of them. the reason being was because I always thought I'm good at drawing and I should do something art related.

I thought of \"I'm desperate for change\", \"I'm failing at life at 19\" etc... But to get to the point, I really need a change. I just turned 19, and this whole decade I have done NOTHING for myself or my life. I'm failing at life. Like I'm in a horrible position, and I don't know how to change, because I guess I don't have the motivation and discipline, desire, commitment etc. I do wanna change, but I guess deeply I feel somewhat comfortable inside so I kinda don't even though I do, I tried to change numerous times, but I always went back to my old habits and I guess I deeply know that my horrible lifestyle is somewhat sustainable (even though it isn't), meaning I can survive like this or whatever, but it's just not the way I wanna be... Idk. I can't achieve what I want in life living like this, it's horrible. Here's is a list of things I am aware of that I need to change:\n\n* I don't brush my teeth everyday, only like 1-3x a week, mostly on Sundays before school\n* I don't shower regularly, only like 1-3x a week, mostly on Sundays before school\n* I don't really groom myself or take care of myself\n* I don't clean my room like EVER, so it's just a constant mess, then I clean it it thoroughly one time and then I leave it to rot for months\n* I don't make and serve my own food, not even bread with butter, everything gets made and served in front of me\n* I don't know basic things, this ties to the previous point\n* I'm fat & unhealthy (my daily liquid intake consists of liters of soda, I eat a lot and a lot of bad stuff, I use nicotine (whether it's cigarettes, vapes, nicotine pouches etc.), I probably have hypertension, I have hyperlipidemia, my eyesight is getting worse, my BMI is high etc...)\n* I have mental issues (anxiety-related mainly)\n* I'm very shy, introverted, socially anxious and maybe awkward, I would also say I'm a yes-man, won't tell people what I really think and instead let them play with me, I have no respect, I barely have any friends and they also seem to have no respect for me, well, I guess they do, but they just bitch me out sometimes or whatever and I don't say nothing back because I'm a yes-man I guess, I have no social life, I can't really communicate with anybody let alone girls, this leads to a lot of issues like not being able to have a girlfriend, hard to make friends etc. (I'm still a virgin, not even a hint of getting rid of it, can't even imagine getting a girl, it seems impossible)\n* I have no money\n\nThis is everything I can think of right now. There are other things but they are much smaller and if I fix the above I can fix the smaller things with certainty (such as biting nails).\n\nAny tips, advice, whatever will be appreciated.\n\nPlease don't quote my post.", "index": "red5_s14_", "post_comments": []}

When life becomes to much, I fled into an imaginary world (TV, books, fanfcis, games, ...), wasn't very happy with my body and suffered from social anxiety. All of this is better now, but I still sometimes struggle with it.  \nSo, here are some tips:  \n  \n1.And very important: Take care of your mental health. Journal, meditate, listen to music, scream - idc. Whatever feels good to take hold of your emotions. You need to like yourself in order to be happier\n\n2.Take care of your physical health (This also will improve your mental health). Workout (and do whatever you like! E.g. I don't like cardio that much, so I tend to not do it, because it's just torture. But I really like strength training, fencing and walks, therefore this is my fitness. Do whatever you like! (Bonus: If you are in a team, you will get to know new people with shared interests!) Also try to eat healthier. Yes, I love chocolate and fastfood, etc. sometimes, but listen to your body and see how it feels. Balance is key! \"Unhealthy\" food from time to time is fine, but try to add healthier foods in your diet.\n\n3.Take care of your social life:  \n-> I LOVE the books \"How to make friends and influence people\"! It's a great (and cheap) book for social skills and I always will recommend it! The skills I learnt from it, made work with patients far more nice and helped me make friends  \n-> Become interesting! Do some interesting hobby you can passionately tell people about it. (Bonus: If it is something social like charity work, you get to meet new people with similar interests)\n\n4. \"Its the dang phone\"... I know, it's a parent saying, but it is true.

When I went through a fanfic phase I tried to do some \u201cproductive\u201d things too, you could try writing your own fanfics to practice your writing skills, or try making fanart! Don\u2019t feel sad about something you enjoy doing, there are both healthy and unhealthy ways to do things (maybe try and learn not to scroll endlessly though).\n\nYou could also try making (preferably physical) friends with similar interests to yours (fandoms, games) to socialize. Or try doing something you like while doing something you don\u2019t like (ex. I like to listen to YouTubers, music or audiobooks while walking, easy exercise).\n\nYou said you\u2019re 17. Are you in school? Most schools have clubs that might interest you (book club, creative writing, gaming) and extracurriculars are basically how you make friends (for me at least lol).
