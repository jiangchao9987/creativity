To be frank, this is not your problem to solve, nor do you have the access nor the tools or knowledge to solve it. I would approach this situation knowing that there is not much you can do.\n\nFor example, your brother not knowing how to read at 8 might be a compounded issue. Sure the YT shorts might be contributing to it, but it's not like he will magically be able to read if he stops watching the Shorts. He will probably need to spend some time with a professional and see what may be the cause for his delay in reading. \n\nIn terms of alternatives two things needs to happen. To decrease his time with Shorts he needs to increase his time doing something else, such as drawing, playing outside, literally anything else honestly. And the second thing that needs to happen is that his limited time with Shorts is enforced. Chances are that he needs permission and supervision to do anything outside of the home, and it sounds like it's not something you can control. It also is not your responsibility to limit his screen time, nor should you try to -- that is for your parents to do. \n\nWhat you CAN do is encourage him to do things with you that don't involve screens. Great alternatives are reading comic books, drawing, trading card games, even things like watching anime, playing videogames, or even Pokemon Go -- even though it's still screen time it's far better than watching YT shorts. \n\nPlease do not worry yourself trying to do something that is ultimately not your responsibility to control."}, {"comment_text": "I'm concerned about my little brother.

It took time but I figured out how to segregate tasks info the Calendar, Tasks, and Reminder apps.\n\nCalendar = Events that don't happen on a regular basis. Job interview, people's birthdays, plans with friends. I also have a shared family calendar for things that my bf may need to know (like me having a therapy appointment). I make sure to use the bright yellow color for important events.\n\nTasks = small, day-to-day chores that I need to do. Doing my taxes, specific work projects. I also have a task list for my cleaning routine and another list for ongoing projects that are unscheduled. Scheduled events can be made to show up on my Google Calendar, so I can see both the events I have scheduled and the tasks I need to get done on a certain day. The tasks are also a different color than events, and you can see incomplete tasks in a drop-down (pending tasks?) in case you didn't get them done on the scheduled day.\n\nReminders = parts of my routine that I'll forget if I don't have the notification showing up on my phone (which goes away when I complete the task). Taking meds, morning and evening walks with my dog, watering my plants. Brushing my teeth lol. Daily things, not the more intermittent chores (those go in the cleaning tasks list).\n\nUsing this system, I have the calendar fairly uncluttered, especially if I deselect the tasks in calendar view. But it's also a good overview of the unique things I have to do in a day. The reminders have an obvious notification without being a super irritating alarm I have to snooze 5 times before I get around to doing something (that's especially helpful for my meds).\n\nI used to have a totally cluttered calendar with everything down as an event, but the trial and error process with these apps has been making a HUGE difference for me.

Whenever a thought pops into my head, I immediately figure out if it's actionable or not. If I can act on it, then it goes into Things 3. If I can't act on it, or it requires more thought, then it goes into Obsidian. \n\nI use Things 3 as my reminder/to-do list app. So, all my actionable items go into there with a set reminder. For example, if I need to pick up the mail, I'll set the reminder for 6pm, when I get home. I also use it for work, so if there's something that needs to get done, Things 3 is where it goes.\n\nWithin Things, I have three categories: Personal, Work, and Creation. They're fairly self-explanatory, but the gist of it is that anything I need to do at home/ in my personal life goes into \"Personal\". Anything that is done at or for work is put into \"Work\". I'm also an aspirational content creator, so anything involving that goes into \"Creation\". I try to keep these short, but if I believe I'll benefit from an explanation, then I'll include that within the notes. Keep in mind that you don't need to use Things 3. You can use Apple Reminders, or any Android alternative.\n\nObsidian is my \"second brain\" in terms of thoughts. Any non-actionable thought goes here. From simple, random ideas like \"build a rocket ship\" to more complex ideas like \"make a video delving into the possibilities of Obsidian\". I prefer Obsidian over alternatives because it's simple. I get easily distracted with looks, organization, and anything in-between. So I use Obsidian because it's hard (for me) to get distracted. Any thoughts I put in here don't need to have explanations. I try to keep my titles straightforward, so I don't forget why I created a note. It needs to be glanceable. Obsidian is great because it allows me to connect ideas. So, if I have multiple thoughts about Content Creation, then I can look at my graph view and see all the ideas connected within the graph. \n\nLastly is Siri Shortcuts. I use Shortcuts to make accessing the two apps above **really** easy. So, I have a shortcut on my Home Screen labeled \"Capture\". This is for thoughts. It's synced with Obsidian, so when I click that shortcut, it opens a dialog box asking me what my thought is. That is then formatted into a markdown file that is sent to Obsidian. The second shortcut is called \"Remind\". Remind is for Things 3. Similar to \"Capture\", it asks for my thought, then it asks which list to put it into. Then it will open Things 3 where I can set the day and time for the reminder, and everything else. I don't know of any alternatives of Shortcuts for Android, so I apologize to those of you who use it. \n\nBONUS: As a bonus, I also do some work on my Mac. For that type of work, I use Raycast to substitute for Shortcuts. It's the same concept. I use a keyword to add a to-do to Things or a thought to Obsidian.

Here's a rough outline of what that looks like:\n\nIn Workflowy:\n- I have an inbox where I dump my brain every morning, evening and whenever a sporadic thought comes to mind. Getting things out of my head helps free up brain space to actually focus on executing tasks, rather than sitting and ruminating on the same one or two thoughts all day.  \n\n- At the start of every day, I categorize my inbox into projects (things that need doing) areas (things that need maintenance/checking up on frequently) and notes (things that don't have a deadline, but I just want to remember for another time). I have these three things in general categories, e.g. \"home\", \"work\", and \"personal projects\".\n(Taking inspiration from PARA but simplifying for my needs). \n\n- At the end of every week, I'll look through my projects and areas, and prioritize them by \"actionability\". How I define that is a combo of \"how fast/easy is this to complete?\" and \"how urgently does this need to be done?\" (strict deadlines first).  \n\n- I also use Workflowy to create a daily to-do list, where I take things from the top of projects and areas (all categories), and make a rough plan for what I think I can achieve each day in the following week. In conjunction, I'll block my calendar with generic \"focus time\" where all notifications are turned off, and I just jam away at what needs to be done.  \n\nTime blocking is also my enemy, but this workflow provides enough flexibility to make sure I have \"undistracted time\" in my day, without tying myself to something specific for X hours.  \n\n- Once I complete a block of focus time, I'll rename the calendar block to reflect what I actually worked on. This is useful to come back to at the end of each week to review how I spent my time. Especially helpful if I didn't get everything done that I thought I could.  \n\n- Also in my calendar, I schedule recurring tasks for any relevant items from \"areas\", so I have a prset block of time to deal with them, and I don't forget about them!  \n\n- Lastly, I usually do a quarterly review, where I'll look through the calendar and reflect on where I spent my time, how effective I was, and how aligned the tasks I completed were with my goals. I'll also go back through projects, areas and notes, and delete things that are no longer relevant.  \n\nWithout this cleanup, looking at \"projects\" for work, for example, would be a massive list of years worth of stuff. That would be overwhelming, seeing how much I didn't do/knowing I can't do it all. A nice side effect is the cleanup can provide the same dopamine hit as actually doing the thing \ud83d\ude05.  \n\nI'll sometimes save a \"note\" in my notes section to keep a train of thought, or explanation as to why I deleted X thing, in case someone asks me + I need a reminder for myself.  \n\n\nVery broad strokes here, but I'd be happy to answer questions on how this could apply to specific scenarios.  \n\nIt has taken me the better part of a decade of trial and error with different systems to come up with this specific workflow, that works for me.

Ik it sounds silly but stay with me \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4fwith the meat, that's kind of all your tasks and obligations so you're supposed to build 6 different types of days so that when you wake up you can ask yourself \"okay what type of sandwich day am I having?\" And choose one of the 6 that suits your day best. The cheese is for unwinding like I said, so you essentially write down things that you enjoy that relax you and schedule a time for them after the meat. They didn't talk about this in the video, but I broke down my cheese into 3 categories: energy givers, neutral, and energy takers. For example, social media time would be an energy taker, TV would be neutral, and drawing would be a giver. I like to pick a couple from different categories to get a balance in my day so l don't spend all my relaxation time on instagram lol! The two slices of bread basically are for the things that you always do in the morning (wake up brush your teeth make coffee etc.) and at night (wash your face, change, typical bedtime routine stuff). Lastly, there's\n\"potato days\" as the video put it, where you create a type of day for stuff that you like (not necessarily meant to relax you like the cheese) this could be hiking, traveling, seeing friends etc.)\n\nOnce I have all my sandwich ingredients ready, l wake up in the morning and fill out a small column for every category. Today's example would be... bread: at 9am, make coffee, make my bed, plan day. Meat: chore/ menial task day: clean bathroom, review flash cards, etc. cheese: work on manuscript, watch tv, social media. Sleep: skincare, shower, etc.\n\nSorry that\u2019s so long but I personally love a lot of detail in this sort of thing!"}, {"comment_text": "I\u2019ve tried all the productivity systems most people swear by, GTD, para, eat that frog, you name it. \n\nHowever, these systems were made by neurotypical for neurotypical people. \n\nI don\u2019t think they work for a lot of us with ADHD, maybe at the beginning when we are excited about the \u201cnew\u201d thing, but this doesn\u2019t last. \n\nMe personally, I need a lot of flexibility, time blocking is my enemy \n\nMy main issues are time management, time blindness, executive dysfunction & hyper-focus but in all the wrong stuff, and not in what I really need to be doing.\n\nIf you struggle with some of these things too, I\u2019d love to hear what if anything worked for you \n\n\nThanks in advance \ud83d\ude43", "reply_text": "Similar story here, no system worked for me.

It's completely new for me as I worked in warehouses where I had to attend every time, set working hours and set breaks etc. I've decided to change career so I self-studied and I got a job as a Junior Web-developer. I've pretty much prepared for this, have my office ready, hardware wise, furniture wise, even some smaller comfortable stuffs. I'm using PC since I was 7 and now I'm almost 38. My sleep schedule is horrible, my lifestyle is not great at all, so many things need to be fixed which I didn't have a chance working physical job(s) far from home in 2 shifts and occasionally Saturdays also. I have family too, wife and 2 kids so yeah it is busy, tiring.\r  \n\r  \nSo my question is how people stay focused during the working hours? I got either distracted or just can't focus for too long. It is great to be at home but also very challenging as I feel like I'm not even at work. My work schedule is also flexible. I have the daily meetings then either nothing or few more meetings with a workdays 6 hours work + 2 hours flexible. Saturday work is also flexible. Pretty much based on trust.\r  \n\r  \nI don't mind working, I don't mind working hard but changing from a physical job to a mental one is a huge change and challenging.\r  \n\r  \nI was thinking about some technique like the Pomodoro timer(physical) or any other time tracking so I can actually get used to the time/break ratio and get more productive hours a day. I try to stay productive, I have a journal, I make lists, I pretty much organized but I can also get easily distracted and procrastinate.\r  \n\r  \nAs a Junior you can imagine I have a lot to learn and I need to catch up, speed up and show my willingness and worthiness. I'm not pressured at work at all, don't get me wrong. This is coming from my expectations which can be false as I'm new to this but yet it is frustrating enough to feel guilty about my bad focus and slacking.\r  \n\r  \nAnyone had same situation and found some fix for it or how to overcome this?", "reply_text": "My experience with WFH over the last 6-7 years has been that it amplifies your good and bad habits. Meaning if you're an early riser and can manage yourself, you're probably going to thrive working from home with the freedom it gives. If you have bad habits like sleeping in, not managing your time well, and get distracted, you're going to struggle.\n\nThe biggest tips I can give for starting out is to have a single room if at all possible for only working. Aka, an office. If it's not a full room, it can be a section of the house like a corner that's your designated work station. You do nothing else but work there. The idea is that even though you're working at home, when you go to that space, you're working. People even go as far as getting dressed for a work-setting, like wearing pants and polo or button down shirt. We have tons of guys at work that I Zoom with that pop on their cameras and they're sitting in offices with button up shirts on. Some people literally will either walk or drive their car in the morning to simulate going to an office.\n\nWith great power comes great responsibility.

It just seems like the norm and we rarely question it.\n\nBut what's interesting is when you consider it, it's generally harder to motivate ourselves in our free time, whether we are tired or not but having energy certainly makes it easier.\n\nAnd at work, there's a sort of constant atmosphere in place to make sure we meet certain standards, there's already external motivation and requirements built into the environment.\n\nWhile it won't help you on the social side at the moment, you could see if shifting when you have your free time helps.\n\nPlace energy prioritization before work, for a period of free time and self investment.

It replenishes steadily until it reaches your baseline rate, where it then stays still until it is used again.\n\n# How social media uses this against you\n\nMost social media companies are actively doing research to understand what features make people stay on the app the longest. TikTok takes all the video data to understand what length of content gets the most attention, and then puts those videos on your \u201cfor you page\u201d. Instagram has multiple versions of the app with a slightly different feature on each one to test which gets the best engagement. They\u2019ve even admitted it [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CE7i75FpYsj/?hl=en&img_index=1) that they test with different versions.\n\nThese companies know exactly how to best trigger your brain to motivate you to open their app and stay on their app. Since you have a finite amount and social media provides one of the easiest dopamine releases, this leaves you with not much motivation left for your other goals.\n\nMost people are really prone to this when they get stressed.

So now, you\u2019re even further behind on work and even more stressed. Therefore you go on social media even more\u2026 and the cycle continues.\n\n# What you can do about this\n\nFirstly, decide what apps are weighing you down. We did an exercise where we thought about what long term benefit each app has for us and what percent of our time on the app is spent on that. The Instagram app for example keeps you connected with your friends, but maybe most of your time is spent on reels. Now, find a way to make it hard for you to access the apps you don't want. One way to do this is to set time limits for each app. Another way is to uninstall the app and use the browser version The browser version of most apps is harder to navigate and does not have the latest features usually. \n\nIt's going to be pretty uncomfortable at first to not get the same instant gratification that you usually do. Allow yourself to feel that discomfort, and note what you feel uncomfortable by. Is it a work task? Or a homework to complete? Maybe a message that you've been avoiding answering? Put your energy to get your to-do list checked off to combat the real source of discomfort instead of just pacifying it with social media.\n\nAnother thing you could do is to start your day off by not opening distracting notifications or going on social media. **Even with the same screen time,** one hour of screen time at night vs one hour of screen time in the day makes a huge difference. If you start your day with social media, you will have less motivation for tasks throughout the rest of the day. \n\nAnd lastly, if you can, you should try in some way to connect to other people. This doesn't have to be a smart-phone free task - it could be something as simple as calling your family or friends during the time you normally would have been on your phone. Or, if you have the resources, you could join a gym, a hiking group, find local events to go to, etc. ", "reply_text": "Nice write up and practical tips. The biggest problem with all these cheap motivation highs is they do get people motivated as you described from the dopamine spikes, but since no real action was done the brain is tricked into thinking it actually accomplished something, and associates the mindless scrolling / no-action as the behavior to reward. That's probably the most common motivation trap out there.\n\nMotivation without desirable action further reinforces the opposite behavior we are trying to change, but if we lean in with a growth mindset to take action first, push through that limbic friction, then naturally motivation will follow as our drive increases from deliberate choices & actions we lead ourselves by. \n\nThis limbic friction is also what triggers brain plasticity on what we want our brain to associate/learn and we can leverage this to intentionally create new habits and create change faster; neurons that fire together wire together, and at night getting quality sleep is when the actual brain rewiring happens. Overtime there will be less resistance as routines become habits, and eventually turn into a lifestyle value!"}, {"comment_text": "Yeah exactly!

TikTok takes all the video data to understand what length of content gets the most attention, and then puts those videos on your \u201cfor you page\u201d. Instagram has multiple versions of the app with a slightly different feature on each one to test which gets the best engagement. They\u2019ve even admitted it [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CE7i75FpYsj/?hl=en&img_index=1) that they test with different versions.\n\nThese companies know exactly how to best trigger your brain to motivate you to open their app and stay on their app. Since you have a finite amount and social media provides one of the easiest dopamine releases, this leaves you with not much motivation left for your other goals.\n\nMost people are really prone to this when they get stressed. Let\u2019s say you have work to do that you are procrastinating. Social media is an easy way to \u201cdestress\u201d - it provides instant gratification whereas your work would take longer to do. So now, you\u2019re even further behind on work and even more stressed. Therefore you go on social media even more\u2026 and the cycle continues.\n\n# What you can do about this\n\nFirstly, decide what apps are weighing you down. We did an exercise where we thought about what long term benefit each app has for us and what percent of our time on the app is spent on that. The Instagram app for example keeps you connected with your friends, but maybe most of your time is spent on reels. Now, find a way to make it hard for you to access the apps you don't want. One way to do this is to set time limits for each app. Another way is to uninstall the app and use the browser version The browser version of most apps is harder to navigate and does not have the latest features usually. \n\nIt's going to be pretty uncomfortable at first to not get the same instant gratification that you usually do. Allow yourself to feel that discomfort, and note what you feel uncomfortable by. Is it a work task? Or a homework to complete? Maybe a message that you've been avoiding answering? Put your energy to get your to-do list checked off to combat the real source of discomfort instead of just pacifying it with social media.\n\nAnother thing you could do is to start your day off by not opening distracting notifications or going on social media. **Even with the same screen time,** one hour of screen time at night vs one hour of screen time in the day makes a huge difference. If you start your day with social media, you will have less motivation for tasks throughout the rest of the day. \n\nAnd lastly, if you can, you should try in some way to connect to other people. This doesn't have to be a smart-phone free task - it could be something as simple as calling your family or friends during the time you normally would have been on your phone. Or, if you have the resources, you could join a gym, a hiking group, find local events to go to, etc. ", "reply_text": "Yes, I was vicied in social medias when i was more younger.
