I'll tell you one thing to put you at ease, and one thing to serve as a warning.\n\n1. It's good to be interested in a wide variety of things, because this keeps you open to new experiences and new opportunities. It's fine to be interested in psychology, technology, science, literature, language, and ten other things, all at once, because these are the factors that are going to allow you to see possible paths forward in your life, and at your age, a \"possible path forward\" may just mean an *interesting experience*.\n2. **But**. The older you get (and I want to stress here that you have like 10 years before this becomes relevant), the more you're going to want to choose between something being a *professional interest,* a *personal interest,* or a *passing interest*. It's very hard to give up a successful career as, say, a therapist in order to pursue your dream of founding a startup. Not impossible, but difficult, particularly if you have family responsibilities by that point.\n\nI don't want to frame myself as exemplary here, but here's how it panned out for me.\n\nAt 19, in college, I entertained the idea that I could write fiction part-time while also composing music for video games and movies, and maybe starring in my own travel TV show or writing travelogues, in the vein of Paul Theroux. I also cared about language-learning, anthropology (which was one of my majors), and tech, particularly user experience design, which was a fairly nascent field at the time.\n\nWhen I graduated, I moved to Taiwan for two years to teach English and learn Mandarin. While there, I played music, wrote short stories, and began to build a portfolio of UX work. In a lot of ways, those were the two most productive years of my life. I was single, worked 20 hours a week in a job I enjoyed, and pursued these passions with the rest of my time.\n\nI got a job offer to work at a tech startup in Shanghai, China. I stayed in China for six years. During that time, I tried to write more, but my time and energy began to dwindle. I stopped treating music as anything but a self-soothing exercise. This was hard at first, but at some point I realized that I enjoyed just sitting down at a piano and playing around. It didn't have to lead anywhere.\n\nI got engaged, and then we moved back to the US to get married. We had a baby 16 months ago, and trying to be a good husband and dad has taken the bulk of my attention. \n\nAlthough I had been working in the tech industry for close to a decade, when I was laid off last year, I decided to really make a go of writing. That's where I'm at now. I still want to achieve new things (financial success in the literary world), but I've realized that I can't build a whole lifestyle out of everything I am interested in. Some of those interests fell away once I realized that they weren't going to define my career, and that's alright.\n\nThat doesn't mean that those interests and experiences don't matter. They inform the stories I write and the people I meet. They shape the way I view myself.

Nothing about you is attractive to girls, lonely, missing opportunities and you'll remain the same person for the next 3 years as well. Honestly, if I had to travel 1.5 hours to work I'd also quit, so I don't think that's a pathetic choice at all. \n\nMental health and physical health goes hand in hand, so start by picking up a healthy lifestyle. A healthy body is attractive to everyone, and being healthy in general is also attractive because it shows discipline.\n\nIt's okay to be angry, but don't use it on yourself. The world is unfair, so if you instead put that anger into bettering yourself, you'll be a completely new person in no time.

I know it's cliche, but 23 IS still very young, you can start something different or new and be on a totally different place in a couple years. I have (not officially diagnosed but 99% sure) inattentive adhd and it's really hard for me to be motivated and do things, keep a routine, etc, and if I had a job situation like that I would be absolutely just miserable and unable to function. It's good you got out of that situation, now hopefully you can find a different job that is better for you. I have not gone to college or anything and feel I've missed a lot of opportunities by reason of circumstance, but after a lot of looking around I started a course to become a professional bookkeeper and am on my way to finish that and hopefully start my own business. I've been pretty past about it unfortunately, but it's been less than a year and it was a fairly small investment to get me doing something, I might not do it forever but it's decent (can be very decent) income and a springboard to other things. Also, I just got my driver's license after I turned 23! It's never too late. It will feel good to find a new direction, even if you're starting \"from scratch, \" before you know it, it will be 6 months, a year, 2 years down the road and you'll be much farther along than you are now. As far as girls, a decent person will recognize the difference between being a bum and not trying to get anywhere, and between having been handed a tougher hand of cards and working through difficulties. Ultimately this build character in a way that everything just falling into place for you your whole life doesn't. You aren't useless at all, finding your way can be super hard, especially in these times, give yourself a few years though and I really bet you'll be in a better place and a better person for it. One thing you can always do that is invaluable for yourself and makes you more attractive to others, both career-wise in in relationships, is work to better yourself personally. You can't always control your circumstances, but you can control your general attitude, how you treat others, how you handle yourself, how you deal with anger, interpersonal skills, etc. You can always be advancing on one front or another. Maybe start working towards getting your license, start taking steps even if they seem small, it will feel great and they will start to really add up.

It's a lifesaver for me, I'll just get stuck doing literally nothing and feel like I can't move, it's 10x worse if I'm depressed. I don't take any meds, but that helps a ton.

Find something easy to do where you can track your progress. It can be as simple as growing a plant. Helping people at a pet or homeless shelter is also great. **Just keep your body moving and your mind occupied everyday.**\n* Mindfulness - Practice being mindful of your attitude towards yourself. Rubbing salt into your own wounds isn't going to help you get better. Follow every negative thought with a constructive thought. Reading books and finding philosophies to follow could help provide structure (doesn't have to be religion.)\n\nLastly, **take things at your own pace.** It's unfair to measure yourself against someone else, they may have privileges in money, opportunities, mentors, mental or physical health that you don't.
