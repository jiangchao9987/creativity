Because digestion is a humongous task your body does, it requires a lot of energy. This can directly affect your sleep, which in turn affects how dull or fresh you feel in the morning. Here are 3 tips that will make it easier for you to wake up in the morning. \n\nChew your food. Sounds simple, but it isn\u2019t. Our digestion process starts from our mouth itself, where the digestive enzymes in our saliva are supposed to break our food down, and our stomach is expecting this half digested food. This way, the energy required by our stomach for digestion will be significantly less. But let\u2019s face it, most of us don\u2019t chew enough, and this is why this is the very first tip. \n\nDon\u2019t stuff yourself with food. This is plain and simple - if you\u2019re overeating, your stomach hates you for making it work overtime! Don\u2019t starve yourself obviously, but also don\u2019t eat like a pig! Interestingly enough, chewing your food well will naturally make sure you don\u2019t eat too much, because we only have so much patience to chew so much food, right?\n\nDon\u2019t Sleep Right After You Eat.  You will observe that our body becomes dull right after we eat. So it may make sense to make use of that dullness and sleep right away. Well, not if you want to get up feeling fresh in the morning! If you keep sufficient gap, where this temporary dullness caused by food has subsided, and then sleep, you will see you will feel much more fresh in the morning when your alarm rings. So have a gap of around 2 hours between dinner and sleep.\n\nMy experience with these tips : So I heard about these tips from Sadhguru last week, and after giving it some thought I was like \u201cwhy not?\u201d. I decided I\u2019ll do it for a week. I'm still baffled to say that I woke up at 5, four times this week! It\u2019s a pretty huge deal for me! I won\u2019t lie though, it feels weird, because I am used to going to bed feeling absolutely dull and sleepy.

Or what you think they expect.\n* Thinking other people think negative about you.\n* Note the things you think/feel can seem very real and can even be confirmed somewhat by people around you. Reason: people react on your behaviour, on your communication. In a way you get back what you send yourself. A self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\n**Good to know**\n\n* You were not born like this. The way you feel now is 'learned'.\n* Usually this is done to you by your parents. You are a victim of their own problematic personalities. By their authoritarian or emotionally neglective upbringing\n* You can easily have the idea you grew up in a normal way while you didn't.\n* The good news: you can overcome this and lead a great life. Since it is learned, it can be unlearned.\n* Millions of people have this problem, you're not alone!\n\n**Healing**\n\n* How unfair as it is, you are the only one who can heal your poisoned brain. And in the end, you have to do the work yourself.\n* Healing will take time and effort, but it can be done. Millions and millions of people did so - and you can too.\n* Start with accepting your current position. This is it. You have to start here and make progress.\n* Be constantly aware things can always be changed. Always.\n* If your parents have caused this, break with them until you are strong enough and aware enough of their behaviour/communication. Go living on your own if possible. Don't listen to anything they say anymore. They are mentally, well, ill.\n* You may seek help from a good therapist.\n* Read books on self-esteem, self-love, self-worth. This can help you tremendously.\n* Start writing. Write down your thoughts in this respect. Everything. Daily. This is necessary for several reasons: To step out the constant thinking in circles. To be able to read things back. To find solutions for the problems. To see progress. To release tension.\n* Take good care of yourself. This is paramount. Eat healthy, exercise, take care of good sleep. Avoid drugs and alcohol.\n* Consider joining a yoga-class. Or a martial arts class, preferably Krav Maga or Muay Thai, as they are realistic and gradually building your confidence.\n* Important for healing: the competence-confidence loop (Google it) and factchecking your fears on being true (99% sure most are not).\n* Set goals for yourself in the main areas of your life and design plans to make them true.\n\n**Advantages of being someone who needs to heal mentally**\n\nThere's a very, very big advantage too, of being someone who needs to heal mentally: Once you start the proces of healing, you will get insight after insight in yourself, the human psyche in general and, if the case, the distorted brains of your parents. Once you're there, you will have a deep understanding of many things, which will give you a big advantage over other people.
