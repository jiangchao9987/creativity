Qualities like this include:\n\n* **Tired** \\- A character who is just exhausted with *something*.  Whether it's physically tired of the day, tired of dealing with someone or something, tired of the stress, or just *anything* that makes their shoulder's slump and that slight, mouth-agape-frown.  Think Tony Stark from Infinity War dealing with the Guardians of the Galaxy.  Think Kratos from the new God of War games.  People who just want to rest but *can't*.\n* **Confused** \\- A character who has no idea what's going on and can't figure it out.  A fish out of water.  A peasant being paraded around in a royal court, unaware of the political intrigue.\n* **Overwhelmed** \\- A character who *does* know what's going on but can't do anything about it.  There are too many things to deal with, too many lives in the balance, too many sides to negotiate.\n* **Willfully Ignorant** \\- A character who knows there's more than what it seems but is choosing (for various reasons) to overlook it.  Burn down that building that they've been assured is empty and not full of children to save their loved one?  Whelp it's a good thing it's night and they'll be well out of earshot before any screaming may or may not be heard.\n* **Angry** \\- Straight up angry characters.  Not emotionally brooding ones who are silently seething with a smile as their victems chat calmly around them.  Give me Kylo Ren roaring in rage as he slashes up computer consoles impotently with his lightsaber.  Give me Hulk."}, {"comment_text": "[**SatChat! SatChat! Party Time!

They have so much power, but all the magic in the world and within their grasp can't solve their social awkwardness and struggles to live alongside others, relate to humans and the people they try to care about.\n\nIt probably stems from growing up as a gifted and neurodiverse child who could never fit in with everyone else in school. I could count the number of friends I keep in touch with from my schooling years with one hand. Always felt like some weirdo alien wearing a human skin who never understood all these hidden social rules and facial cues.  And despite how everyone says I'll be able to figure out all these emotional, human things eventually, stop alienating people by strange behaviors and being really weird abt things because \"omg you're so smart why can't you get it?\"...I still don't. Still fucking clueless as hell.\n\nSo, sometimes, I give my non-human characters someone I wish I had. A human foil and friend to bounce off. A nice human to show them the good in the world.\n\nIn retrospect, its a recurring pattern in my responses to writing prompts. And for some reason the non-human is usually male and the nice human is female, I don't know why.\n\n[Elbert](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1bsts4h/wp_every_time_you_die_you_receive_points_based_on/kxije2i/) has Samantha, Laura is the only one who believes [Mr. Hopper](https://www.reddit.com/r/TregonialWrites/comments/1brmogt/youre_a_dimensionhopper_who_can_walk_through/kx9y9c8/) can save all the worlds, [Lord Elvari](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1ayhpss/ot_fun_trope_friday_writing_with_tropes_road_trip/ksiiwqh/) has Kat, Sarah is supportive of [Vindalos](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1ajh22c/piscientists_revive_a_dead_god_through_prayer_and/), and there's definitely others I don't remember right now.\n\nAs for me, having joined WP reddit and discord, it feels like the Fun Trope Friday (FTF) gang is the \"nice human\" to the silly tentacle writer here.

With\u00a0[](https://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompts/), I like to view the prompts as puzzles to be solved, or a chance to exercise certain muscles (e.g. scene description, dialogue, inner monologue, etc).

There are all sorts of things I find relatable in all manner of characters. That's the goal of good character writing, after all, isn't it? To color them with the sort of characteristics that make them feel real and... relatable. However, the characters I most *enjoy* reading are dry wits (e.g. Wodehouse's Jeeves) or the delusional and grandiose blowhards (e.g. Ignatius J Reilly)."}, {"comment_text": "[**SatChat! SatChat!

These characters are the most realistic, in my opinion. Chances are, should anyone be sent to an alternate world or anything, they won't run around doing edgy stuff or killing demon lords or any of that. They would probably settle down somewhere and live peacefully while following the law and the economy. (fr most of you won't even last in a swordfight because of the weight alone, no matter what anime or movies say)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nB.) I find characters that don't care to be funny, and also, there is some edgy satisfaction in knowing you can fix a problem yet choose not to because it's not your problem, to begin with (ie. not getting involved in a fight because you don't care and not because of some ideological stuff or moral stuff) and its probably not even worth the hassle to get involved (ie. you can get in trouble or have the blame pinned on you if you interfere)\n\nC.) Not only are these types of characters carefree in that no plot device can necessarily compel them to move towards anything, but morality is fairly flexible for these characters, making them easier to write. They don't get boring because I can easily just model the story however I want to without writing myself into a corner because I made them too evil or too good or any of the typical traps authors get trapped in.\n\nD.) Power is not necessary for these characters, and they are probably the most flexible. I can use them for an action story, a wholesome story, a comedy story, etc., without having to change them much, and these characters, beyond being good protagonists, also make good likable side characters due to their reliability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nE.) Greatest of all, authors bias.\n\nThis type of character is my favorite and reflects how I am in real life more than other characters, so yeah.

Yesterday they decided to replace you with some incompetent noble, before kicking you out of the castle. You then spent the night in a nearby forest. However today you were awakened by the beasts who chose to follow you.", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1c0peoo/pi_you_were_the_caretaker_for_the_mythical_beasts/", "post_comments": [{"comment_text": "Original prompt: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/qm5eh4/wp\\_you\\_were\\_the\\_caretaker\\_for\\_the\\_mythical\\_beasts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/qm5eh4/wp_you_were_the_caretaker_for_the_mythical_beasts/)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe day I was fired from my job as caretaker for the royal family\u2019s creatures, or as my employers put it, \u2018released from duties,\u2019 I didn\u2019t know what to do. Caring for them was practically my whole life.\n\nMy quarters at the castle were no longer mine, but I was never someone who relished in filling my living space with things, so I needed no assistance. They\u2019d given me only one day\u2019s notice, but I didn\u2019t even need that day. My personal belongings could all fit in a bag that slung over my shoulder. That didn\u2019t include my books, though, and those were obviously the most important of my things. So, I donated all but my three favorites to the local library. At least I knew they\u2019d be nearby to reread them if I wished.\n\nMy replacement was incompetent. It was plain to see to anyone paying attention, but the royal family only cared that she was a noble, and they bought into her song and dance of allegedly proficiency with all manner of creatures. It seemed absurd that they were to replace one woman with another just because of social standing, but after the incidents in town the previous month with a mentally unstable necromancer and several draugr, they\u2019d wanted to \u2018upgrade\u2019 the person in charge of their creatures. They were just too foolish to see that that wasn\u2019t what they\u2019d done.\n\nWalking into the forest, I figured I would go through the rocky area to the west of town until I found a cave that was both dry and unoccupied. Such a long time had passed since I\u2019d last slept outdoors that I didn\u2019t even have proper camping equipment. It wouldn\u2019t be a comfortable rest, but I didn\u2019t want to spend my savings on it at the moment, now that I was jobless. Furthermore, I didn\u2019t want to be with the townsfolk right now. For all my efforts, I still blamed them for making such a fuss over that necromancer that the royal family decided to placate them by hiring someone of great renown for the castle\u2019s creatures.\n\nAfter finding my temporary home before the sun went down, I made a pillow by putting some of my clothing in a bag that I would use to designate clothes that needed to be laundered. A hard bed was one thing; nowhere to rest my head would have been difficult. I watched the sun set, turning the horizon into a beautiful glowing mix of deep orange and red, the blue sky giving way to the dark of night.\n\nAt the edge of the cave on the rocky surface of the surrounding area, I built a small fire, tossing in peppermint and lemon balm to attempt to keep away pests. Then, once I\u2019d had dinner, gotten a few into one of my books, and then started to feel sleepy, I snuffed it out. Hoping the smells emanating from the ashes would assist in deterring mosquitos and other bothersome insects, I settled in the spot in which I planned to sleep.\n\nThe forest comes alive in a different way when the sun has set. Most assume the animals of the woods all find a safe place to hide away from the world and sleep, and yes, the ones they see during the day certainly do. But the area was teeming with nocturnal life, and the little noises here and there could scare those sleeping rough for the first time. To me it was a gentle chorus of sounds, the croaks of frogs, the hoots of owls, all the sounds that sang together over the echoing foundation of chirping crickets. I listened as I saw the occasionally firefly flit past and, at one point, saw a nearby frog make a meal of one of the crickets.\n\nMany prefer the familiar sounds of people going about nightly business, even if it means risking being roused and sent packing by a store owner unwilling to let you rest in the alley, or being badgered by a drunk who came to the alley to vomit or piss. I prefer the forest. Always have, always will.\n\nI feel a kinship with my ancestors, the ones who came long before me and made their homes in caves like this. There are dangers in the forest, especially in the dark of night, but I\u2019m quite knowledgeable of them all and know how to stay safe. I\u2019d even been particular with the food I\u2019d procured from the kitchen\u2019s chef before I left, eschewing dried meats in favor of things like plain bread and nuts that had little odor and wouldn\u2019t attract predators.\n\nThat was why my instincts woke me when I heard the sounds of footsteps. Not those of a person; those were distinctive, easy to identify. These were the footsteps of something large, but to my surprise, I realized I recognized the animal they were coming from. Standing up and walking to the mouth of the cave, I saw the Jorogumo come out from the brush. *My* Jorogumo. Well, she was never really mine, but if I\u2019d asked her, Nanami probably would have said she belonged to me and I belonged to her.\n\nThe colossal spider was a foot taller than me, but there was nothing to be frightened of. She was a carnivore, as were so many of the creatures that the royals kept, but similar to any typical domesticated animal, would never harm me. She was absolutely not domesticated, but I trusted her, the type of solid trust built over time, starting with a sturdy foundation and created from mutual understanding and care. When her multitude of eyes settled on me, she chittered and her pace sped up until she was to a stop in front of me, putting a leg over my shoulder and across my back.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here, sweetheart?\u201d I asked worriedly, smoothing down the hairs on her legs. Nanami\u2019s demeanor wasn\u2019t distressed. Quite the contrary, she seemed content, and leaned her leg into my pats. \u201cThey royals are going to be upset that you left.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t exactly speak with the creatures I cared for when they were in animal form, and couldn\u2019t speak with the ones unable to shift to a human form to speak. But they had abilities to understand me on an empathic level, so they knew what my words meant and how to decipher the feelings behind them. Also, body language conveyed a lot, and from what I could see, she didn\u2019t seem concerned with thoughts of the royals.\n\nThen more footsteps sounded, faint at first and then, as I moved to look behind her, getting gradually louder. \u201cOh, my,\u201d I said muttered.\n\nThe others were coming as well. After a few minutes, those who had been straggling behind caught up, and they were all there. Alfie, the Nuckelavee, came over with his big brown eyes blinking at me tiredly, which didn\u2019t surprise me since it was a bit of a trek and he was not among the nocturnal ones in this gathering. The royals\u2019 ammit, the adze, all of them were there. By this point, the guards must have realized the animals had left, but I doubted any had the nerve to chase after them in an attempt to get them to return.\n\nMoving my gaze back to Nanami, I quietly said, \u201cYou are going to get in so much trouble.\u201d I couldn\u2019t hold back a small smile when I said so, however.\n\nThe giant spider stepped back and a female human\u2019s body gradually emerged from her back, a partial shift so she would be able to speak. It was visible down to the shoulders and her long, dark hair fell down the carapace that merged with the skin of the human bust. \u201cYou leave,\u201d she rasped, her slow voice that of an old woman after a lifelong fondness for cigars. \u201cWe leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cNanami\u2026\u201d I started. Staring into her bulbous eyes, I shook my head and sighed. \u201cI love all of you. You know that. But what I had at the castle was a job. That meant they could find someone else, someone of higher standing. I\u2019m no noble, that\u2019s for sure, so there\u2019s nothing to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoble is foolish,\u201d she said with disdain. \u201cFood is silly, dead and mushy and boring. Noble does not play, does not bring treats, does not know us.\u201d\n\nGiving her a grim smile, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. But you bring much pride to the royals by being in their menagerie.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoble does not love us.\u201d\n\nMy face fell at that.

Caring for them was practically my whole life.\n\nMy quarters at the castle were no longer mine, but I was never someone who relished in filling my living space with things, so I needed no assistance.

It was plain to see to anyone paying attention, but the royal family only cared that she was a noble, and they bought into her song and dance of allegedly proficiency with all manner of creatures. It seemed absurd that they were to replace one woman with another just because of social standing, but after the incidents in town the previous month with a mentally unstable necromancer and several draugr, they\u2019d wanted to \u2018upgrade\u2019 the person in charge of their creatures. They were just too foolish to see that that wasn\u2019t what they\u2019d done.\n\nWalking into the forest, I figured I would go through the rocky area to the west of town until I found a cave that was both dry and unoccupied. Such a long time had passed since I\u2019d last slept outdoors that I didn\u2019t even have proper camping equipment. It wouldn\u2019t be a comfortable rest, but I didn\u2019t want to spend my savings on it at the moment, now that I was jobless. Furthermore, I didn\u2019t want to be with the townsfolk right now. For all my efforts, I still blamed them for making such a fuss over that necromancer that the royal family decided to placate them by hiring someone of great renown for the castle\u2019s creatures.\n\nAfter finding my temporary home before the sun went down, I made a pillow by putting some of my clothing in a bag that I would use to designate clothes that needed to be laundered. A hard bed was one thing; nowhere to rest my head would have been difficult. I watched the sun set, turning the horizon into a beautiful glowing mix of deep orange and red, the blue sky giving way to the dark of night.\n\nAt the edge of the cave on the rocky surface of the surrounding area, I built a small fire, tossing in peppermint and lemon balm to attempt to keep away pests. Then, once I\u2019d had dinner, gotten a few into one of my books, and then started to feel sleepy, I snuffed it out. Hoping the smells emanating from the ashes would assist in deterring mosquitos and other bothersome insects, I settled in the spot in which I planned to sleep.\n\nThe forest comes alive in a different way when the sun has set. Most assume the animals of the woods all find a safe place to hide away from the world and sleep, and yes, the ones they see during the day certainly do. But the area was teeming with nocturnal life, and the little noises here and there could scare those sleeping rough for the first time. To me it was a gentle chorus of sounds, the croaks of frogs, the hoots of owls, all the sounds that sang together over the echoing foundation of chirping crickets. I listened as I saw the occasionally firefly flit past and, at one point, saw a nearby frog make a meal of one of the crickets.\n\nMany prefer the familiar sounds of people going about nightly business, even if it means risking being roused and sent packing by a store owner unwilling to let you rest in the alley, or being badgered by a drunk who came to the alley to vomit or piss. I prefer the forest. Always have, always will.\n\nI feel a kinship with my ancestors, the ones who came long before me and made their homes in caves like this. There are dangers in the forest, especially in the dark of night, but I\u2019m quite knowledgeable of them all and know how to stay safe. I\u2019d even been particular with the food I\u2019d procured from the kitchen\u2019s chef before I left, eschewing dried meats in favor of things like plain bread and nuts that had little odor and wouldn\u2019t attract predators.\n\nThat was why my instincts woke me when I heard the sounds of footsteps. Not those of a person; those were distinctive, easy to identify. These were the footsteps of something large, but to my surprise, I realized I recognized the animal they were coming from. Standing up and walking to the mouth of the cave, I saw the Jorogumo come out from the brush. *My* Jorogumo. Well, she was never really mine, but if I\u2019d asked her, Nanami probably would have said she belonged to me and I belonged to her.\n\nThe colossal spider was a foot taller than me, but there was nothing to be frightened of. She was a carnivore, as were so many of the creatures that the royals kept, but similar to any typical domesticated animal, would never harm me. She was absolutely not domesticated, but I trusted her, the type of solid trust built over time, starting with a sturdy foundation and created from mutual understanding and care. When her multitude of eyes settled on me, she chittered and her pace sped up until she was to a stop in front of me, putting a leg over my shoulder and across my back.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here, sweetheart?\u201d I asked worriedly, smoothing down the hairs on her legs. Nanami\u2019s demeanor wasn\u2019t distressed. Quite the contrary, she seemed content, and leaned her leg into my pats. \u201cThey royals are going to be upset that you left.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t exactly speak with the creatures I cared for when they were in animal form, and couldn\u2019t speak with the ones unable to shift to a human form to speak. But they had abilities to understand me on an empathic level, so they knew what my words meant and how to decipher the feelings behind them. Also, body language conveyed a lot, and from what I could see, she didn\u2019t seem concerned with thoughts of the royals.\n\nThen more footsteps sounded, faint at first and then, as I moved to look behind her, getting gradually louder. \u201cOh, my,\u201d I said muttered.\n\nThe others were coming as well. After a few minutes, those who had been straggling behind caught up, and they were all there. Alfie, the Nuckelavee, came over with his big brown eyes blinking at me tiredly, which didn\u2019t surprise me since it was a bit of a trek and he was not among the nocturnal ones in this gathering. The royals\u2019 ammit, the adze, all of them were there. By this point, the guards must have realized the animals had left, but I doubted any had the nerve to chase after them in an attempt to get them to return.\n\nMoving my gaze back to Nanami, I quietly said, \u201cYou are going to get in so much trouble.\u201d I couldn\u2019t hold back a small smile when I said so, however.\n\nThe giant spider stepped back and a female human\u2019s body gradually emerged from her back, a partial shift so she would be able to speak. It was visible down to the shoulders and her long, dark hair fell down the carapace that merged with the skin of the human bust. \u201cYou leave,\u201d she rasped, her slow voice that of an old woman after a lifelong fondness for cigars. \u201cWe leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cNanami\u2026\u201d I started. Staring into her bulbous eyes, I shook my head and sighed. \u201cI love all of you. You know that. But what I had at the castle was a job. That meant they could find someone else, someone of higher standing. I\u2019m no noble, that\u2019s for sure, so there\u2019s nothing to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoble is foolish,\u201d she said with disdain. \u201cFood is silly, dead and mushy and boring. Noble does not play, does not bring treats, does not know us.\u201d\n\nGiving her a grim smile, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. But you bring much pride to the royals by being in their menagerie.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoble does not love us.\u201d\n\nMy face fell at that. Not all royals had caretakers that bonded so closely with their beasts, but it was vital if they wanted a highly reputable menagerie. \u201cIf you refuse to go back,\u201d I told her, \u201cthey might try to force you, and I don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d\n\nHer human face turned to an expression that said, *\u2018I\u2019d like to see them try.\u2019*\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh, knowing that she was probably right in that respect.

Such a long time had passed since I\u2019d last slept outdoors that I didn\u2019t even have proper camping equipment.

A hard bed was one thing; nowhere to rest my head would have been difficult. I watched the sun set, turning the horizon into a beautiful glowing mix of deep orange and red, the blue sky giving way to the dark of night.\n\nAt the edge of the cave on the rocky surface of the surrounding area, I built a small fire, tossing in peppermint and lemon balm to attempt to keep away pests. Then, once I\u2019d had dinner, gotten a few into one of my books, and then started to feel sleepy, I snuffed it out. Hoping the smells emanating from the ashes would assist in deterring mosquitos and other bothersome insects, I settled in the spot in which I planned to sleep.\n\nThe forest comes alive in a different way when the sun has set. Most assume the animals of the woods all find a safe place to hide away from the world and sleep, and yes, the ones they see during the day certainly do.

There are dangers in the forest, especially in the dark of night, but I\u2019m quite knowledgeable of them all and know how to stay safe.

She was absolutely not domesticated, but I trusted her, the type of solid trust built over time, starting with a sturdy foundation and created from mutual understanding and care. When her multitude of eyes settled on me, she chittered and her pace sped up until she was to a stop in front of me, putting a leg over my shoulder and across my back.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here, sweetheart?\u201d I asked worriedly, smoothing down the hairs on her legs. Nanami\u2019s demeanor wasn\u2019t distressed. Quite the contrary, she seemed content, and leaned her leg into my pats. \u201cThey royals are going to be upset that you left.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t exactly speak with the creatures I cared for when they were in animal form, and couldn\u2019t speak with the ones unable to shift to a human form to speak. But they had abilities to understand me on an empathic level, so they knew what my words meant and how to decipher the feelings behind them. Also, body language conveyed a lot, and from what I could see, she didn\u2019t seem concerned with thoughts of the royals.\n\nThen more footsteps sounded, faint at first and then, as I moved to look behind her, getting gradually louder. \u201cOh, my,\u201d I said muttered.\n\nThe others were coming as well. After a few minutes, those who had been straggling behind caught up, and they were all there. Alfie, the Nuckelavee, came over with his big brown eyes blinking at me tiredly, which didn\u2019t surprise me since it was a bit of a trek and he was not among the nocturnal ones in this gathering. The royals\u2019 ammit, the adze, all of them were there. By this point, the guards must have realized the animals had left, but I doubted any had the nerve to chase after them in an attempt to get them to return.\n\nMoving my gaze back to Nanami, I quietly said, \u201cYou are going to get in so much trouble.\u201d I couldn\u2019t hold back a small smile when I said so, however.\n\nThe giant spider stepped back and a female human\u2019s body gradually emerged from her back, a partial shift so she would be able to speak. It was visible down to the shoulders and her long, dark hair fell down the carapace that merged with the skin of the human bust. \u201cYou leave,\u201d she rasped, her slow voice that of an old woman after a lifelong fondness for cigars. \u201cWe leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cNanami\u2026\u201d I started. Staring into her bulbous eyes, I shook my head and sighed. \u201cI love all of you. You know that. But what I had at the castle was a job. That meant they could find someone else, someone of higher standing. I\u2019m no noble, that\u2019s for sure, so there\u2019s nothing to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoble is foolish,\u201d she said with disdain. \u201cFood is silly, dead and mushy and boring. Noble does not play, does not bring treats, does not know us.\u201d\n\nGiving her a grim smile, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. But you bring much pride to the royals by being in their menagerie.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoble does not love us.\u201d\n\nMy face fell at that. Not all royals had caretakers that bonded so closely with their beasts, but it was vital if they wanted a highly reputable menagerie. \u201cIf you refuse to go back,\u201d I told her, \u201cthey might try to force you, and I don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d\n\nHer human face turned to an expression that said, *\u2018I\u2019d like to see them try.\u2019*\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh, knowing that she was probably right in that respect. I\u2019d held this job for eight years, and the man before me had held it for twenty-eight. It was such an important job, and not just for the reasons the royals held. These creatures were precious, rare, and if they were unsatisfied with their caretaker, they could very well make a fuss that would make a child most destructive, deafening temper tantrum look like a polite request.\n\nAlfie walked up to us. \u201cYou help?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot help all of you escape out into the wild,\u201d I chuckled. \u201cThat would never work, for so many reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cNoble does job. You help.\u201d\n\nPausing for a moment, I furrowed my brow in curiosity.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a bad idea. As a matter of fact, the king and queen would likely consider it when they realized what had happened tonight. I hoped they wouldn\u2019t blame me, accuse me of telling the animals to leave until I was rehired as their keeper, but from the years I\u2019d known them, it didn\u2019t seem likely. Queen Penelope, at least, knew that I wouldn\u2019t jeopardize the creatures\u2019 safety. And this was indeed an issue of safety, since plenty of townsfolks would consider most of them a threat just by their presence, and would kill them.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, nodding, causing Nanami to chitter and several others to perk up hopefully. \u201cI\u2019ll ask. But I\u2019m *asking*. They might say no. If that\u2019s the case, I know they won\u2019t be able to keep you from leaving, but\u2026 I just want all of you to be safe. Safe and happy, but mostly safe. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Alfie said. \u201cUnderstand.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d I glanced to the cave. \u201cLet me gather my things and we\u2019ll head back to the castle. Hopefully they didn\u2019t panic the town by sounding an alarm that there was a jailbreak of their collection of carnivores.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "reply_text": "I love this story!

They were just too foolish to see that that wasn\u2019t what they\u2019d done.\n\nWalking into the forest, I figured I would go through the rocky area to the west of town until I found a cave that was both dry and unoccupied. Such a long time had passed since I\u2019d last slept outdoors that I didn\u2019t even have proper camping equipment. It wouldn\u2019t be a comfortable rest, but I didn\u2019t want to spend my savings on it at the moment, now that I was jobless. Furthermore, I didn\u2019t want to be with the townsfolk right now. For all my efforts, I still blamed them for making such a fuss over that necromancer that the royal family decided to placate them by hiring someone of great renown for the castle\u2019s creatures.\n\nAfter finding my temporary home before the sun went down, I made a pillow by putting some of my clothing in a bag that I would use to designate clothes that needed to be laundered. A hard bed was one thing; nowhere to rest my head would have been difficult. I watched the sun set, turning the horizon into a beautiful glowing mix of deep orange and red, the blue sky giving way to the dark of night.\n\nAt the edge of the cave on the rocky surface of the surrounding area, I built a small fire, tossing in peppermint and lemon balm to attempt to keep away pests. Then, once I\u2019d had dinner, gotten a few into one of my books, and then started to feel sleepy, I snuffed it out. Hoping the smells emanating from the ashes would assist in deterring mosquitos and other bothersome insects, I settled in the spot in which I planned to sleep.\n\nThe forest comes alive in a different way when the sun has set. Most assume the animals of the woods all find a safe place to hide away from the world and sleep, and yes, the ones they see during the day certainly do. But the area was teeming with nocturnal life, and the little noises here and there could scare those sleeping rough for the first time. To me it was a gentle chorus of sounds, the croaks of frogs, the hoots of owls, all the sounds that sang together over the echoing foundation of chirping crickets. I listened as I saw the occasionally firefly flit past and, at one point, saw a nearby frog make a meal of one of the crickets.\n\nMany prefer the familiar sounds of people going about nightly business, even if it means risking being roused and sent packing by a store owner unwilling to let you rest in the alley, or being badgered by a drunk who came to the alley to vomit or piss. I prefer the forest. Always have, always will.\n\nI feel a kinship with my ancestors, the ones who came long before me and made their homes in caves like this. There are dangers in the forest, especially in the dark of night, but I\u2019m quite knowledgeable of them all and know how to stay safe. I\u2019d even been particular with the food I\u2019d procured from the kitchen\u2019s chef before I left, eschewing dried meats in favor of things like plain bread and nuts that had little odor and wouldn\u2019t attract predators.\n\nThat was why my instincts woke me when I heard the sounds of footsteps. Not those of a person; those were distinctive, easy to identify. These were the footsteps of something large, but to my surprise, I realized I recognized the animal they were coming from. Standing up and walking to the mouth of the cave, I saw the Jorogumo come out from the brush. *My* Jorogumo. Well, she was never really mine, but if I\u2019d asked her, Nanami probably would have said she belonged to me and I belonged to her.\n\nThe colossal spider was a foot taller than me, but there was nothing to be frightened of. She was a carnivore, as were so many of the creatures that the royals kept, but similar to any typical domesticated animal, would never harm me. She was absolutely not domesticated, but I trusted her, the type of solid trust built over time, starting with a sturdy foundation and created from mutual understanding and care. When her multitude of eyes settled on me, she chittered and her pace sped up until she was to a stop in front of me, putting a leg over my shoulder and across my back.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here, sweetheart?\u201d I asked worriedly, smoothing down the hairs on her legs. Nanami\u2019s demeanor wasn\u2019t distressed. Quite the contrary, she seemed content, and leaned her leg into my pats. \u201cThey royals are going to be upset that you left.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t exactly speak with the creatures I cared for when they were in animal form, and couldn\u2019t speak with the ones unable to shift to a human form to speak. But they had abilities to understand me on an empathic level, so they knew what my words meant and how to decipher the feelings behind them. Also, body language conveyed a lot, and from what I could see, she didn\u2019t seem concerned with thoughts of the royals.\n\nThen more footsteps sounded, faint at first and then, as I moved to look behind her, getting gradually louder. \u201cOh, my,\u201d I said muttered.\n\nThe others were coming as well. After a few minutes, those who had been straggling behind caught up, and they were all there. Alfie, the Nuckelavee, came over with his big brown eyes blinking at me tiredly, which didn\u2019t surprise me since it was a bit of a trek and he was not among the nocturnal ones in this gathering. The royals\u2019 ammit, the adze, all of them were there. By this point, the guards must have realized the animals had left, but I doubted any had the nerve to chase after them in an attempt to get them to return.\n\nMoving my gaze back to Nanami, I quietly said, \u201cYou are going to get in so much trouble.\u201d I couldn\u2019t hold back a small smile when I said so, however.\n\nThe giant spider stepped back and a female human\u2019s body gradually emerged from her back, a partial shift so she would be able to speak. It was visible down to the shoulders and her long, dark hair fell down the carapace that merged with the skin of the human bust. \u201cYou leave,\u201d she rasped, her slow voice that of an old woman after a lifelong fondness for cigars. \u201cWe leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cNanami\u2026\u201d I started. Staring into her bulbous eyes, I shook my head and sighed. \u201cI love all of you. You know that. But what I had at the castle was a job. That meant they could find someone else, someone of higher standing. I\u2019m no noble, that\u2019s for sure, so there\u2019s nothing to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoble is foolish,\u201d she said with disdain. \u201cFood is silly, dead and mushy and boring. Noble does not play, does not bring treats, does not know us.\u201d\n\nGiving her a grim smile, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. But you bring much pride to the royals by being in their menagerie.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoble does not love us.\u201d\n\nMy face fell at that.

It wouldn\u2019t be a comfortable rest, but I didn\u2019t want to spend my savings on it at the moment, now that I was jobless. Furthermore, I didn\u2019t want to be with the townsfolk right now. For all my efforts, I still blamed them for making such a fuss over that necromancer that the royal family decided to placate them by hiring someone of great renown for the castle\u2019s creatures.\n\nAfter finding my temporary home before the sun went down, I made a pillow by putting some of my clothing in a bag that I would use to designate clothes that needed to be laundered. A hard bed was one thing; nowhere to rest my head would have been difficult. I watched the sun set, turning the horizon into a beautiful glowing mix of deep orange and red, the blue sky giving way to the dark of night.\n\nAt the edge of the cave on the rocky surface of the surrounding area, I built a small fire, tossing in peppermint and lemon balm to attempt to keep away pests. Then, once I\u2019d had dinner, gotten a few into one of my books, and then started to feel sleepy, I snuffed it out. Hoping the smells emanating from the ashes would assist in deterring mosquitos and other bothersome insects, I settled in the spot in which I planned to sleep.\n\nThe forest comes alive in a different way when the sun has set. Most assume the animals of the woods all find a safe place to hide away from the world and sleep, and yes, the ones they see during the day certainly do. But the area was teeming with nocturnal life, and the little noises here and there could scare those sleeping rough for the first time. To me it was a gentle chorus of sounds, the croaks of frogs, the hoots of owls, all the sounds that sang together over the echoing foundation of chirping crickets. I listened as I saw the occasionally firefly flit past and, at one point, saw a nearby frog make a meal of one of the crickets.\n\nMany prefer the familiar sounds of people going about nightly business, even if it means risking being roused and sent packing by a store owner unwilling to let you rest in the alley, or being badgered by a drunk who came to the alley to vomit or piss. I prefer the forest. Always have, always will.\n\nI feel a kinship with my ancestors, the ones who came long before me and made their homes in caves like this. There are dangers in the forest, especially in the dark of night, but I\u2019m quite knowledgeable of them all and know how to stay safe. I\u2019d even been particular with the food I\u2019d procured from the kitchen\u2019s chef before I left, eschewing dried meats in favor of things like plain bread and nuts that had little odor and wouldn\u2019t attract predators.\n\nThat was why my instincts woke me when I heard the sounds of footsteps. Not those of a person; those were distinctive, easy to identify. These were the footsteps of something large, but to my surprise, I realized I recognized the animal they were coming from. Standing up and walking to the mouth of the cave, I saw the Jorogumo come out from the brush. *My* Jorogumo. Well, she was never really mine, but if I\u2019d asked her, Nanami probably would have said she belonged to me and I belonged to her.\n\nThe colossal spider was a foot taller than me, but there was nothing to be frightened of. She was a carnivore, as were so many of the creatures that the royals kept, but similar to any typical domesticated animal, would never harm me. She was absolutely not domesticated, but I trusted her, the type of solid trust built over time, starting with a sturdy foundation and created from mutual understanding and care. When her multitude of eyes settled on me, she chittered and her pace sped up until she was to a stop in front of me, putting a leg over my shoulder and across my back.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing out here, sweetheart?\u201d I asked worriedly, smoothing down the hairs on her legs. Nanami\u2019s demeanor wasn\u2019t distressed. Quite the contrary, she seemed content, and leaned her leg into my pats. \u201cThey royals are going to be upset that you left.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t exactly speak with the creatures I cared for when they were in animal form, and couldn\u2019t speak with the ones unable to shift to a human form to speak. But they had abilities to understand me on an empathic level, so they knew what my words meant and how to decipher the feelings behind them. Also, body language conveyed a lot, and from what I could see, she didn\u2019t seem concerned with thoughts of the royals.\n\nThen more footsteps sounded, faint at first and then, as I moved to look behind her, getting gradually louder. \u201cOh, my,\u201d I said muttered.\n\nThe others were coming as well. After a few minutes, those who had been straggling behind caught up, and they were all there. Alfie, the Nuckelavee, came over with his big brown eyes blinking at me tiredly, which didn\u2019t surprise me since it was a bit of a trek and he was not among the nocturnal ones in this gathering. The royals\u2019 ammit, the adze, all of them were there. By this point, the guards must have realized the animals had left, but I doubted any had the nerve to chase after them in an attempt to get them to return.\n\nMoving my gaze back to Nanami, I quietly said, \u201cYou are going to get in so much trouble.\u201d I couldn\u2019t hold back a small smile when I said so, however.\n\nThe giant spider stepped back and a female human\u2019s body gradually emerged from her back, a partial shift so she would be able to speak. It was visible down to the shoulders and her long, dark hair fell down the carapace that merged with the skin of the human bust. \u201cYou leave,\u201d she rasped, her slow voice that of an old woman after a lifelong fondness for cigars. \u201cWe leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cNanami\u2026\u201d I started. Staring into her bulbous eyes, I shook my head and sighed. \u201cI love all of you. You know that. But what I had at the castle was a job. That meant they could find someone else, someone of higher standing. I\u2019m no noble, that\u2019s for sure, so there\u2019s nothing to be done.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoble is foolish,\u201d she said with disdain. \u201cFood is silly, dead and mushy and boring. Noble does not play, does not bring treats, does not know us.\u201d\n\nGiving her a grim smile, I said, \u201cThat\u2019s unfortunate. But you bring much pride to the royals by being in their menagerie.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoble does not love us.\u201d\n\nMy face fell at that. Not all royals had caretakers that bonded so closely with their beasts, but it was vital if they wanted a highly reputable menagerie. \u201cIf you refuse to go back,\u201d I told her, \u201cthey might try to force you, and I don\u2019t want that to happen.\u201d\n\nHer human face turned to an expression that said, *\u2018I\u2019d like to see them try.\u2019*\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but laugh, knowing that she was probably right in that respect. I\u2019d held this job for eight years, and the man before me had held it for twenty-eight. It was such an important job, and not just for the reasons the royals held. These creatures were precious, rare, and if they were unsatisfied with their caretaker, they could very well make a fuss that would make a child most destructive, deafening temper tantrum look like a polite request.\n\nAlfie walked up to us. \u201cYou help?\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot help all of you escape out into the wild,\u201d I chuckled. \u201cThat would never work, for so many reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cNoble does job. You help.\u201d\n\nPausing for a moment, I furrowed my brow in curiosity.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a bad idea. As a matter of fact, the king and queen would likely consider it when they realized what had happened tonight. I hoped they wouldn\u2019t blame me, accuse me of telling the animals to leave until I was rehired as their keeper, but from the years I\u2019d known them, it didn\u2019t seem likely. Queen Penelope, at least, knew that I wouldn\u2019t jeopardize the creatures\u2019 safety. And this was indeed an issue of safety, since plenty of townsfolks would consider most of them a threat just by their presence, and would kill them.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d I said, nodding, causing Nanami to chitter and several others to perk up hopefully. \u201cI\u2019ll ask. But I\u2019m *asking*. They might say no. If that\u2019s the case, I know they won\u2019t be able to keep you from leaving, but\u2026 I just want all of you to be safe. Safe and happy, but mostly safe. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Alfie said. \u201cUnderstand.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d I glanced to the cave. \u201cLet me gather my things and we\u2019ll head back to the castle. Hopefully they didn\u2019t panic the town by sounding an alarm that there was a jailbreak of their collection of carnivores.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nr/storiesbykaren", "reply_text": "Wonderful!
