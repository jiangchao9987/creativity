Glad you asked. :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n-\t**Every week we will have a new spotlight trope.**\n\n-\t**Each week, there will be a new genre assigned to write a story about the trope.**\n\n-\t**You can then either use or subvert the trope in a 750-word max (vs 600) story or poem (unless otherwise specified).**\n\n-\t**To qualify for ranking, you will need to provide ONE actionable feedback. More are welcome of course!**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThree winners will be selected each week based on votes, so remember to read your fellow authors\u2019 works and **DM me your votes** for the top three.\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n\nNext up\u2026\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMax Word Count: **750 words**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTrope: **[Wise Beyond Their Years]( https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WiseBeyondTheirYears)**\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nGenre: **[Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_fiction)** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSkill: **Show a believable friendship or other relationship between two characters** (optional)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nConstraint: **Include a surprisingly wholesome detail or [MacGuffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin)** (optional)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt\u2019s lonely being special. Different. Misunderstood. Constantly looked to for guidance. Positively exhausting! \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe classic wise beyond their years trope is about a kid who understands the world as an adult would. But really this could apply more broadly, so use your imagination. E.g., the twenty-something who understands how their firm works better than management. Or the new parent who is practically savant-like in knowing how to raise kids. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nBut one thing these sagacious characters have in common is seeing the world in a way that is different than the norm for their age. This can lead to respect, jealousy, love, hate. Anything really. So consider exploring how strange this othering can be and how the wise character may feel about it. Arrogant? Unworthy? Lonely? \n\n&nbsp;\n\nOr spin the trope on its head and explore an immature (hu)manchild or the like. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, have at it. Lean into the trope heavily or spin it on its head. The choice is yours!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHave a great idea for a future topic to discuss or just want to give feedback? FTF is a fun feature, so it\u2019s all about what you want\u2014so please let me know! Please share in the comments or DM me on Discord or Reddit!\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n\n**Last Week\u2019s Winners**\n\nPLEASE remember to give feedback\u2014this affects your ranking.

It had been a long and treacherous way to get here, but he had finally made it. The small hut of the herbalist was crooked with a roof that almost reached the ground where a wild flowers and herbs gave off a sweet smell. A calico cat slept in the warm sun.\n\nThe door of the hut consisted of a million tiny beads on strings that gave off a clear tingle when he pushed them aside. \n\nInside he was greeted by the smell of fresh herbs and honey. It was cooler here, but not unpleasant. Light from green glass windows fell on shelves brimming with jars full of various plants and liquids. The herbalist was working behind a burly wooden table teeming with all kinds of instruments that were unfamiliar to Bj\u00f6rn. When he entered she stopped her work and greeted him warmly.\n\n\"Welcome, dear traveller. You must have travelled far, for your feet are heavy and your shoulders weary. Your lover must be lucky to have someone like you to look after them.\"\n\n\"How did you know I was here to find a cure for my lover's illness?\"\n\n\"A lucky guess. What is their name, if I may ask? What ill nature has befallen them?\"\n\n\"Alex, is their name. They have caught a strange illness and no herbalist has found a cure or known help.  It is a black fever that makes one cough up blood at night and turns your very flesh grey. You are the last hope I have, if you can't help no one can.\"\n\n\"A black fever you say? That is bad luck, but I will try my best to mix up a potion that may help you.\" \n\nThe herbalist turned and pulled jars from the shelves. With a quick motion she swept the strange instruments aside and set up a new workplace. While she was working Bj\u00f6rn realised how young she was. She must have seen less than eighteen winters. He had heard of a magical herbalist at the edge of civilization but never that she was only a child. Suddenly a question formed in his mind.\n\n\"Why here?\"\n\nThe herbalist cocked her head. \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why are you here in the middle of nowhere instead of the city? So many people have heard of you and so many could use your help, so why are you not closer to them? For the quiet of the forest?\"\n\nAt once the girl grew quiet and a sudden weight seemed to lay on her shoulders.\n\n\"I am not here because I hate people, if that's what you mean. Nor for the quietness of the forest, although I do enjoy it. If I could, I would not be this secluded, but if I could I would do a lot of things.\"\n\nShe turned aside, but not before Bj\u00f6rn could see tears forming in her eyes. He moved to console her, but stopped himself when he realized he was a big man. Instead he quietly stood there, waiting for her to break the silence.\n\n\"They called me a witch. The devils daughter. You can help people, but that won't stop them from hating you. In the end it is better that I am out here, alone, and that they are back there in their cities. Still there are people who hate you for everything.\"\n\nHe could hear the hurt in her voice.\n\n\"I'm sorry\", he whispered. It didn't seem enough\n\nThe silence between them was broken when the cat strolled inside and rubbed her legs. She picked it up and stroked its soft fur.\n\n\"It's ok. I'm not completely alone and I have my hut and my garden. But you have come for a different reason. Your heart is heavy with sorrows and will only hang heavier with mine.\"\n\nSetting down the cat she picked up work on her potion. Soon she had prepared a flask of dark purple liquid. \n\n\"Give this to them. Their recovery will take time and hard work. They may not pay it back. Will you commit?\"\n\n\"I will. I love him with all my heart. Thank you. I will forever be in your debt.\"\n\nThe herbalist nodded and handed him the flask. On the doorstep he turned back.\n\n\"I am sorry about what I said. I'm happy you have found your place and everyone who says otherwise should learn about compassion first.\"\n\nA small smile crept on the herbalists face.\n\n\"Thank you. I wish you a fond farewell, may your journey be safe and his recovery quick!\"\n\nBj\u00f6rn smiled, waved and escaped to find his lover."}, {"comment_author": "Lothungr", "comment_text": "Hi there, author here. Couldn't fit this comment in the reddit word count. This was a very fun challenge. Sadly I had to cut a lot of details to make the word count. But that's what personal files are for, I guess. If you can find some time I'd love some feedback, so I can improve my craft"}, {"comment_author": "ZachTheLitchKing", "comment_text": "Howdy Lothungr!\n\nJust so you know, you're allowed to put your comment in the main post, just have a little line or something to indicate it's not part of the story :)\n\nAlso per r/WritingPrompts standard, [wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net) is what's used to check the word counts and it looks like yours is coming in at 772, so gotta shave off about twenty-two words.\n\nLet's see if I can help with that :D\n\nLove the first paragraph, it does a great job not only describing the scene but also setting the vibe.  Bjorn was on a journey, a long one, and he was finally at his destination.  He's after a healer, and given he was able to make a long journey it implies that there's a loved one at stake.  This gives a great amount of tension to an otherwise serene location.  I love it <3\n\nThe line describing the door is nice but unnecessary.  It's also twenty-four words.  If you cut it, you'll come in under the word count :D\n\nThe introduction of the herbalist is wonderfully mundane and mystical at the same time.  She's just working away with herbs and spices - I'm imagining her with a mortar and pestle - and greets him when he arrives.  But there's something *knowing* about her.  How much magic is infused in her concoctions?  They know Bjorn is there for another but don't know exactly who.  It's easy to assume it's someone important - I did so in the first paragraph - but she seems to have some extra details like they are lovers.\n\nSus.  Lucky guess indeed :squint:\n\nAhh, so she's a witch.  You did a good job building up her emotional reveal, and the professional aspect of her wanting to turn things back quickly to Bjorn's worries is deftly handled.  \n\nWhile this may not be your intent at all, I feel like there's a *subtle* sinister undertone; the fact that she *looks* so young (trope excluded), the way she was able to just know the relationship Bjorn was there for, and the way a smile *crept* onto her face at the end.\n\nMe thinks people fear the witch for good reason?\n\nAnyway that's just speculation :)  Great piece!  I got a little hooked towards the end which is why my critical eye seems to have fallen off xD But that's a good thing, it means you really pulled me into the story.  I hope to see more from you here in future weeks :D\n\nGood words!"}, {"comment_author": "T_Lawliet", "comment_text": "**A Link In The Chain.**\n\nWC: 750 \n\nDamn you, princess, I thought, riding miserably through the forest. Even the darned horse seemed to pick up on my mood.\u00a0\n\nHeir to the throne, now. She was probably going to marry some frog-faced duke. I\u2019d promised her the world, but what could I give her now that she didn\u2019t already have?\u00a0 I slashed at the surrounding branches, then got my blade stuck in a tree. And me? I\u2019d probably mope around the palace till I perished of old age, provided I wasn\u2019t murdered first.\n\nI tugged on my sword, cursing. Hunting had always been fun, had always been..freeing. But now it just felt like a wider cage.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI wanted\u2026 damn, I didn\u2019t know what. Just something other than this.\n\nWith one final cry, I ripped my blade out of the tree, just in time to hear the beat of a dragon\u2019s wing. *Good morning, breakfast!* I heard a voice squeal. I threw myself off the horse as the dragon\u2019s jaws closed around it. I heard the horse give one frenzied cry, then a loud crunch.\u00a0\n\nThe thorns of the bushes I had landed in were\n\nmaking ribbons out of my tunic, but somehow that didn\u2019t seem too urgent a concern. I raised my sword, but I couldn\u2019t stop my arm from trembling.\u00a0\n\nThe dragon looked at me, its eyes golden saucers. *Ah, I needed a snack to take with me.*\u00a0\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d I yelped. \u201cWait, no -\u201d\n\nThe dragon pounced.\u00a0"}, {"comment_author": "T_Lawliet", "comment_text": "I had plenty of time to think about my life choices, being carried along in the air. For instance, choosing to give my guards the slip. What had I been thinking?\u00a0\n\nIt felt like the wind was my stepmother, slapping me in the face. Bone white talons drug into my shoulders, and I clutched them for dear life. Neither of these things made it easy to think.\u00a0\n\n\u201cGreetings, O Great Wyrm!\u201d I called into the wind. \u201cMay I request\u00a0 the name of a being of such unimaginable majesty?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe dragon huffed. *You talk strangely for such a small manling. Very well, snack, you may address me as the Dragon Caramir, the Red Scourge of the Skies.*\u00a0\n\nIt seemed like a mouthful. I was about to try and butter him up again when the dragon chose to dive. Tell the ballad singers I faced the fall with a stiff lip and a fire in my eye. I clutched my knees together as the dragon dropped me on the ground. My breeches were wetter than usual. I took a deep breath, feeling it rattle in my chest.\u00a0\n\nMy father would be calling a search, surely. And my Delia? She would\u2026\n\nFor a moment, I felt those green eyes stare into me. Stare through me. Unknowable.\u00a0\n\nI felt the dragon\u2019s claw grip me again, and toss me into the cave. It was cold, dark, and nearly completely empty.\u00a0\n\nWhat had I been expecting? I don\u2019t know. I guess it was too much to expect me to be kidnapped by a famous dragon. But this was just ridiculous. I was tempted to say it out loud, just to see the dragon\u2019s expression. Instead:\n\n\u201cO Great Wyrm, what misfortune has befallen thee? Some horrid thief must have taken your hoard!\u201d\u00a0\n\n*A thief, yes.* The dragon seemed to shift uncomfortably. *Yes, that\u2019s exactly what happened.*\u00a0\n\n\u201cDear heavens!\u201d I cried, stepping forward and patting the dragon\u2019s snout.\u201dThis injustice must be ended! Such a wonderful creature should not have to live in squalor!\u201d\u00a0\n\n*Hmm.* The dragon rubbed his nose against my hand. *I know, Mr. snack. You can\u2019t believe what horrors I\u2019ve gone through.*\u00a0\n\n\u201cForgive me if this sounds presumptuous for a mere manling, but I can right this wrong.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe dragon blinked, red scales suddenly enlit by inward fire. *Really? I mean\u2026* He snarled. I\\*\u2019ve heard empty words before.\\*\u00a0\n\nI shook my head. \u201cI always keep my promises, good Wyrm.\u201d But there was more than one way to keep this one.\u00a0\n\nMy father would pay a ransom. He loved me just enough for that. It was the safe option.. And maybe, just maybe, the stress of losing me would raise my princess\u2019s regard\u2026\n\nIt might not.\n\nI always envied the ballads for that. I hated how every time, the hero and his love seemed so sure, so certain. And I\u2026\n\nI looked the dragon eye to eye. \u201cMake me your servant, and i\u2019ll give you all the gold you desire.\u201d\u00a0Then I bowed my head, and made sure he couldn\u2019t see my smile.\u00a0\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n**Want to know the rest of the story?** \n\n[A Hint of Suspicion Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1ac9x7m/ot_fun_trope_friday_writing_with_tropes_crime/)\n\n[A Hint of Suspicion Part Two](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1ai4i7q/comment/kouur0p/?context=3)"}]}, {"post_title": "[OT] SatChat: What types of characters do you find most relatable?

Qualities like this include:\n\n* **Tired** \\- A character who is just exhausted with *something*.  Whether it's physically tired of the day, tired of dealing with someone or something, tired of the stress, or just *anything* that makes their shoulder's slump and that slight, mouth-agape-frown.  Think Tony Stark from Infinity War dealing with the Guardians of the Galaxy.  Think Kratos from the new God of War games.  People who just want to rest but *can't*.\n* **Confused** \\- A character who has no idea what's going on and can't figure it out.  A fish out of water.  A peasant being paraded around in a royal court, unaware of the political intrigue.\n* **Overwhelmed** \\- A character who *does* know what's going on but can't do anything about it.  There are too many things to deal with, too many lives in the balance, too many sides to negotiate.\n* **Willfully Ignorant** \\- A character who knows there's more than what it seems but is choosing (for various reasons) to overlook it.  Burn down that building that they've been assured is empty and not full of children to save their loved one?  Whelp it's a good thing it's night and they'll be well out of earshot before any screaming may or may not be heard.\n* **Angry** \\- Straight up angry characters.  Not emotionally brooding ones who are silently seething with a smile as their victems chat calmly around them.

Give me Hulk."}, {"comment_author": "MajorParadox", "comment_text": "Good choices!"}, {"comment_author": "xwhy", "comment_text": "If they're relatable, they're good, or there's good in them that can be brought out.

They have so much power, but all the magic in the world and within their grasp can't solve their social awkwardness and struggles to live alongside others, relate to humans and the people they try to care about.\n\nIt probably stems from growing up as a gifted and neurodiverse child who could never fit in with everyone else in school. I could count the number of friends I keep in touch with from my schooling years with one hand. Always felt like some weirdo alien wearing a human skin who never understood all these hidden social rules and facial cues.  And despite how everyone says I'll be able to figure out all these emotional, human things eventually, stop alienating people by strange behaviors and being really weird abt things because \"omg you're so smart why can't you get it?\"...I still don't. Still fucking clueless as hell.\n\nSo, sometimes, I give my non-human characters someone I wish I had. A human foil and friend to bounce off. A nice human to show them the good in the world.\n\nIn retrospect, its a recurring pattern in my responses to writing prompts. And for some reason the non-human is usually male and the nice human is female, I don't know why.\n\n[Elbert](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1bsts4h/wp_every_time_you_die_you_receive_points_based_on/kxije2i/) has Samantha, Laura is the only one who believes [Mr. Hopper](https://www.reddit.com/r/TregonialWrites/comments/1brmogt/youre_a_dimensionhopper_who_can_walk_through/kx9y9c8/) can save all the worlds, [Lord Elvari](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1ayhpss/ot_fun_trope_friday_writing_with_tropes_road_trip/ksiiwqh/) has Kat, Sarah is supportive of [Vindalos](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1ajh22c/piscientists_revive_a_dead_god_through_prayer_and/), and there's definitely others I don't remember right now.\n\nAs for me, having joined WP reddit and discord, it feels like the Fun Trope Friday (FTF) gang is the \"nice human\" to the silly tentacle writer here.

There are all sorts of things I find relatable in all manner of characters. That's the goal of good character writing, after all, isn't it? To color them with the sort of characteristics that make them feel real and... relatable. However, the characters I most *enjoy* reading are dry wits (e.g. Wodehouse's Jeeves) or the delusional and grandiose blowhards (e.g. Ignatius J Reilly)."}, {"comment_author": "MajorParadox", "comment_text": "Good answer!

These characters are the most realistic, in my opinion. Chances are, should anyone be sent to an alternate world or anything, they won't run around doing edgy stuff or killing demon lords or any of that. They would probably settle down somewhere and live peacefully while following the law and the economy. (fr most of you won't even last in a swordfight because of the weight alone, no matter what anime or movies say)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nB.) I find characters that don't care to be funny, and also, there is some edgy satisfaction in knowing you can fix a problem yet choose not to because it's not your problem, to begin with (ie. not getting involved in a fight because you don't care and not because of some ideological stuff or moral stuff) and its probably not even worth the hassle to get involved (ie. you can get in trouble or have the blame pinned on you if you interfere)\n\nC.) Not only are these types of characters carefree in that no plot device can necessarily compel them to move towards anything, but morality is fairly flexible for these characters, making them easier to write. They don't get boring because I can easily just model the story however I want to without writing myself into a corner because I made them too evil or too good or any of the typical traps authors get trapped in.\n\nD.) Power is not necessary for these characters, and they are probably the most flexible. I can use them for an action story, a wholesome story, a comedy story, etc., without having to change them much, and these characters, beyond being good protagonists, also make good likable side characters due to their reliability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nE.) Greatest of all, authors bias.\n\nThis type of character is my favorite and reflects how I am in real life more than other characters, so yeah.

She's gorgeous. \n\n\"Are you, uh, sure your parents won't notice their daughter is 'boyfriend girlfriend' with a human female?\"\n\n\"They're not gonna check you. \\[translator error\\]'s honor.\"\n\n\"Okay. But you had better make it worth my while.\"\n\n\"You have my word. I'll do what I can to repay you. Put this on.\"\n\nShe flogs me the same type of clothing she has. A skintight body suit with armor plating and a fur collar. She handed me a scrunchy that had clearly been retrieved from the side of the road somewhere. I quickly disrobe behind some cover and change into the weird alien suit and do my hair up. \n\nThe alien washes my eyeliner and mascara off. Her eyes sparkled after she was done. I know that look. \"*Cute*\" I bet she thought. Never mind, though. I guess it's time to get into a transport and head off to meet the alien's parents. \n\nWe didn't go immediately. Apparently the alien needed evidence to show off to her parents. We'd be making for the whole parental meet'n'greet in a couple days. Over the course of the next day and a half, she took me to an alien theme park, a stargazing tour which was really a bunch of trips to other planets to look at local cultures' constellations, and two very nice dinner dates. All the while she lied via her social media that I was the one that took her to all these things. \n\nThe alien theme park is the most interesting theme park I've probably ever been to. Instead of rollercoasters there were Momentum Runs. You become basically an Oozoid from DND and you slip and slide around a very slick pipe. The feeling is unlike anything I've ever witnessed. Instead of bumper cars you have what the theme park called Zap-Your-Friends, which is just a UFO ride where you pilot your own open cockpit UFO and shoot your friends with nonlethal static shock levels of electricity. Probably 500 volt three nanosecond pulses. They also have food from all over the universe for you to enjoy. You're scanned and food from their stock that you can eat illuminates on a picture menu. Point to it, pay in the equivalent of whatever currency you have and enjoy. There are a few arcade games, some from Earth, most from everywhere in the galaxy, and there are even some conventional Earth carnival rides. \n\nThe stargazing tour took us to so many planets. The local people spoke through more universal translators about the cultural significance of their constellations. I couldn't help but draw on the similarities. We immortalized gods and warriors in the heavens. So too did so many other civilizations. On one of the planets, we were asked if anyone was from Earth. Only I raised my hand. I was greeted in English by the tourguide. A hunched over, saurian, four legged and four armed warrior type creature about twice the height of a grizzly bear on its hind legs beckoned me over and groveled at my feet. It is a Silvalek. This member of a warrior race, as well as the rest of his entire race, apparently worship humans as gods. Beats me as to why. Thankfully I didn't stay around long. \n\nThe dinner dates were honestly some of the best I ever went to. All my food was delicious, even if the alien fare looked absolutely awful. Turns out the alien I'm with is a carnivore. Some of the meat she was eating looked a lot like vegetables, or what I could assume was a vegetable. We went to the home of the Silvalek for one of the dinner dates. At this point, the alien was just trying to mess with me. Even the Silvalek king King Throk came and bid me homage. Literally hundreds lined up outside to fall to their four knees in worship. Silvalek are also carnivores and their staple food is, in Human language, Irik. Irik are chihuahua sized lizard cats that the Silvalek keep as a \"staple crop.\" They taste... Like a weird mix of pork and chicken. Despite the fattiness of some of the cuts, the meat tastes very good. I felt really invigorated after eating it. Must be packed with nutrients and energy. Enough to supply a two-ton silvalek warrior. \n\n\\[1/2\\]"}, {"comment_author": "Scorppio500", "comment_text": "\\[2/2\\]\n\nAfter our dates, and a good night rest, it is finally time to meet the parents of the alien. Throughout all this, she had never given me her name. So while we were en-route to her parents' house, I asked her. \n\nShe looks at me with those beautiful amethyst eyes and says her name. \"Amethyst.\" I smiled in relief. It's not something I can't pronounce. \n\n\"I don't believe I caught your name,\" she says. \n\n\"Oh, right. I'm Emily. But just call me Emile. At least... until we're clear of your parents.\" I smile sheepishly. Really should've introduced myself early on. Awkward. We both end up smiling awkwardly. \n\n\"Okay, Emile, I'm sure my parents will love you!\" Amethyst giggles a bit. God, she's so pretty. \n\nOur little transport docks at a big alien starport. Giant bugfolk check us in for disembarking and come aboard to do a security sweep. Finding a me, a human, they say something to Amethyst in their bugspeak which my translator has a hard time deciphering, but the gist of it was that I need a pressure suit. The bugs exit the airlock and return with a measuring device. They scan me with it, and the space suit they brought in seems to change in size to match my size. I quickly put it on over my clothes. \n\nAmethyst doesn't need a pressure suit. Just a breathing mask. Apparently the reason for all this is because the docking bays area is all depressurized due to a malfunction in the airlocks. Some meddling Lombax accidentally blew the hyperbolic rayshield stabilizers trying to make it function better. At least they tried. I noticed the bugfolk didn't seem to need pressure suits. I guess their exoskeleton and tubes on their tubercles were all they needed. \n\nI was helped along by a bugfok, whose species I learned to be a Hektar, to walk across the low gravity section into the artificial gravity field. It was much easier to walk after that. \n\nThe meeting itself? I had been dreading it for some time. Turns out, it was totally fine. Amethyst's parents are really cool and they knew enough about humans to scare me into thinking the entire ruse would be for naught. But turns out, the ruse did in fact work. Her parents approved of me and we finally got to go back to Earth. \n\nUnfortunately upon departing from the place, Amethyst gets a text message on her comm unit. \"Make sure to bring Emile back with you sometime next week! We want to have him over for dinner! Get to know him a bit better!\" Amethyst looks at me with an \"oh shit\" look in her six beautiful eyes. \n\n\"I guess,\" Amethyst says \"You're going to have to keep doing this for awhile, eh?\"\n\nI look at her and smile. \"If you bring me to places like you've been doing, sure. But why not come spend time on earth? I'd be happy to have the company.\" \n\nAmethyst looked at me joyfully. That smile could light up a city. \"Really? You'd do it? Oh thank you! My parents can be the worst!\"\n\n\"No, really,\" I said, \"I'd enjoy it very much. You're kinder than most humans I've met, and not gonna lie, you're gorgeous. I'm happy just to be around you.\"\n\nWas it impulse? Maybe it was. But as soon as I stopped talking, Amethyst kissed me. On the lips. \"Sorry,\" she said after our lips parted. \"I don't know what I was thinking. I shouldn't have done that just now.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I said. \"It felt nice. You should do that more often.\"\n\nAnd she did. More than a couple times. I stepped foot on earth covered in purple lip marks, and I had the biggest smile on my face.

Gleaming steel adorned in silver crosses. His longsword was similarly adorned. Sir Lang finished his preparations and declared to the gathering of villagers, \"I will escort this months... sacrifice... to the den of these werewolves (Lang made sure it was abundantly clear that he meant plural). Be ready to evacuate if you see any come.\"\n\nAn older man, seemingly the father of the boy Lang spoke with upon arrival, called out, \"There's only one werewolf!

I'm sure when I go off to kill my next vampire, you would wisely advise I hand him the stake to drive through *my* heart.

He tried to run toward Nicole but the lead werewolf cut his path, its mouth salivating.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet, Mayor.\u201d Nicole pointed her gun at the lead werewolf. She and her group needed to be careful. These werewolves can move faster than their trigger fingers.

The threat of death just got a lot higher, and that means two things.\"\n\nThe villager who answered earlier speaks up again, leading me to wonder if he was just there for show, \"What does it mean?\"\n\n\"First, I'm going to need as many silver coins, platters, or other baubles as you can gather, some good leather strips, and don't expect much if any of that back. Secondly, if I do find more than just the one werewolf, you owe me the same bounty for each head I bring back, the silver not included.\" The villagers all paled when they considered the cost and before they could object I explained my thoughts. \"If it were simply one beast, I could take it down without much worry for my life. I've dealt with their kind before. However now that there's a good potential that there's a whole pack of them, i have to worry about being attacked from all angles even when engaged with the original.

Please kind hunter, could you see it in your heart to do us a charity?\" Asked one of the fairer of the villagers in their leader's stead, who seemed to be having a rather rough time coming to grips with my terms. She clasped her hands together and offered the a desperate smile. \n\n\"I don't work for charity Miss. I kill monster's for a living, I'll need another form of payment. Good will doesn't fill my belly, mend my gear, or replace my supplies.\" I shake my head. This isn't the first time someone has tried to haggle with me, and it won't be the last. But at least they haven't promised the world and then tried to kill me to get out of paying their due. \"I may kill monsters, but I'm not a monster myself. How about this, I'll do the deed, and my original price still stands, but we can spread out the payments. One on return, and then let's say another payment every month for as many months as I bring back heads. Unless you have something else of value in town to trade.\"\n\nThe whole room began to murmur amongst themselves, some contemplating if it was worth the cost, others wondering if they had an heirloom that could suffice as payment. After the crowd murmured for a decent amount of time, I thought now would be a good time to mention. \"By the way, did you guys know that Monster Hunter services are a major deductible on your taxes as a village? All the money that you're paying me is coming from the crown's pocket if there's more than one werewolf.\"\n\nThe tension suddenly disappeared in the room, and they were much more amenable after that, and a month later I was recovering well from my injuries, a proper suit of silver mail hung in my armory, and I still had enough gold to last me a couple more summers."}, {"comment_author": "Still_Price_9676", "comment_text": "My blood ran cold upon hearing this statement.

I asked him how often he fed them and he said \u201conce a month.\u201d That\u2019s horrible, absolutely horrible, for all I know I could be talking to one rn, this entire village could be comprised of werewolves. This made worse because everyone in this village is a farmer and they all have cattle. The one thing I know about werewolves is they love pattern so I asked the chief where he meets the wolf, I was told the entrance of the village. I decided that my best course of action was to stay at their overnight inn, I put my sword right by my bedside and I shut off the lamp. *Crack* I woke up in a startle and turned on my lamp. There it was, 7 foot, black fur, large claws, piercing gaze, large ears, and a very muscular build. Weird thing was it had a familiar smell, the smell of the village. I drew my sword and I assumed my stance, I got a few scratches but it\u2019s dead. I decided to look outside the inn to make sure the village was alright and I was met with a grim sight. A group of 7 werewolves were a half mile out from my position, standing right at the entrance. The chief offered up multiple people for the wolves to take. I thought it would be better to deal with this in the morning, I was too tired for this. I awoke to pure silence, there wasn\u2019t the usual breakfast commotion of a place like this, just pin drop silence. I grabbed my sword and stepped out of my room. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes, the innkeeper was gone and the inn was empty, I went behind his desk to search for signs and it smelled exactly like the wolf I just killed, I was right. It\u2019s in the village. I had to tell the chief so I went out of the building to tell him but before I could say anything he came up to me smiling \u201cI know where they are, I found them\u201d he said, skeptical of this because of last night, I asked him to lead me there. Wrong choice of words, we set out towards a nearby forest and while on the way I told him about the innkeeper. He looked deeply saddened by the news, I should\u2019ve seen the red flags. We started to approach a cave but suddenly I heard a whistle behind me. I drew my sword and turned around out of fear, seven of them.

There is some commotion from the crowd of villagers at his reaction but that too was quickly quelled once they met his mismatched eyes. Your motley group dominates the tiny public square, and you travel with four other hunters; Kaal, the career necromancer, the demon twins Avi and Rain, and the berserker Cassandra.\n\nThe village isn't a large one, just a few wooden houses that might have made better kindling than shelter, and a singular merchant's guild with a red painted 'CLOSED' plaque on its door. It was no surprise that any monster hunter worth a bit of salt hadn't come to address the issue, but still, you couldn't bring yourself to denigrate the old man further for his decisions. The chief continued to splutter uselessly, red-faced and perhaps a bit tearful, a sore sight for anyone with a bit of heart. You hold up a placating hand and stare pointedly at the slightly larger hovel he'd emerged from, \"We'd like to learn a bit more about the monsters that plague you--and the...victims, may we?\"\n\n\\--\n\n\"Truly, my friend, you are fucked,\" Cassandra says to the resident baker. The man is downtrodden, having gone through the high of his daughter, Lily, (possibly) being alive quickly followed by the crash of discovering that Lily was very likely a werewolf now and he would more than likely be her very first target.\n\nThe surrounding group of residents were in low spirits, all having learned the consequences of their decisions. Their sacrificial habits hadn't placated the infected werewolf hoard, it had grown it.\n\nThe bonfires they'd been instructed to burn at each corner of the village cast a warm light in contrast to the conflicting emotions that permeate the atmosphere. The trees cast long shadows and faintly, Cassandra hears a howl in the distance and opts to keep that information to herself...for now.\n\nKaal chants quietly under his breath, tying talismans made of sage and slivers of pure silver to the trembling necks of the victims' family members. Others shuffle about uncomfortably.\n\n\"Six months, they've been brewing for so long--\" said Avi, her voice low and calm. \"--longer than usual. How has this entire town not been infected?\" Finishes Rain, he drums his fingers against the shack they are leaning against.\n\nYou settle next to the two, you just finished talking to some farmers who've futilely armed themselves with hoes and scythes. You let the shadows of the building wash over you as you contemplate the strange circumstances you found yourselves in.\n\n*The town was on the map.*\n\nNo matter how inefficient the empire is, it took special care and gave extra funding to the officials in charge of cartography, the census, and especially to the Heralds. It was crucial to keep track of the population to keep track of those infected (The robust Department of Taxation simply ended up being a convenient byproduct for the imperial family).\n\n*There was a merchant guild.*\n\nAlbeit closed, and didn\u2019t that ring alarm bells?\n\n*It has been at least six months since a Herald had come through*.\n\nThe records provided by the fief lord indicated regular visitation by one. The last recorded only a month and a half ago. A Herald should be running through a town every month to keep the public up to date on the latest protocols regarding Infection.\n\n*So where was the Herald?*\n\nGeoff Adler was the last Herald recorded, and according to his route, should be in the Corin Duchy to relay any findings by now. But the Chief had said none had come through matching his description.\n\n\u201cOh, Shit!\u201d Your reverie is broken by a loud curse, the dying light of the setting sun illuminates the now convulsing bodies of those who\u2019d sacrificed their family members to the wolves. You sprint towards Kaal and pull him away from the villagers beginning to claw at his tattooed arms. With a dagger in hand, you back toward the bonfire as without Kaal to cling to, they begin to contort and claw at one another. The scent of blood fills the air, it coats your throat.\n\n*Your fangs threaten to emerge.*\n\n\u201cBy the Jewels.\u201d You hear Cassandra curse, she\u2019s plowed through the lurching villagers to stand by the two of you near the towering flames. The flickering shadow beneath your feet curls and the twins sprout from them, their eyes red and their claws sharpened.\n\nKaal gasps, he leans forward, supporting himself with a hand on your shoulder. He shakes his head at your concerned glance, instead, he looks toward the mayhem taking place. You follow his line of sight and notice\u2026*not a single villager has been spared.*\n\nThe old chief lies bloodied in a fetal position nearby.\n\nThese creatures shy away from the bonfires Kaal enchanted. Some tear at their faces, others gnaw on the severed limbs of the fallen. From here, you can see smatterings of bloodied bone litter the ground. In a few moments, the village transformed into a hell on earth.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t normal infection--\u201c whispers Rain, he\u2019s in a defensive position, crouched low to the ground, Avi curls next to him, she's trembling ever so slightly.\n\n\u201cNo\u2026it\u2019s worse,\u201d Kaal says through heavy breaths.\n\nAnd then...you hear the howls."}]}, {"post_title": "[WP]Your are your normal, boring self.

Then I awaken... in a very nicely furnished jail cell? What is this, the SCP foundation? \n\nTurns out I'd be closer to the correct answer than I thought. This is a cell in the USP Florence ADMAX facility. Says so on the wall. The supermax prison not too far from the city I live in. I feel like garbage. I must've been chloroformed or something. \n\nI don't remember coming here at all. I was still in my sexy lingerie my boyfriend got me and my kitty ears and tie-on tail. I'll bet carrying me while I was unconscious wearing this was awkward. I sent up a silent prayer the agents that took me here weren't weirded out. I might've also got really drunk last night, so on top of the chloroforming or other sedation method, the ick feeling was compounded by my clearly hungover state. I saw some mismatched clothing with the tags still on them sitting in the bunk across from the sofa I was laying on. I put those on. \n\nThere is a button on the wall with a note that says \"When you're up and dressed, press this. We'll bring you a coffee and some warm breakfast.\" The wire ran through the window to the veritable blast door which was removed so it could be run. I laced on the standard prison shoes and pressed the button. \n\nTwo armed security guards appeared at my door. One has a coffee in his hand, the other has a quite nice looking breakfast under a clear cloche carefully positioned under her arm. She asks me to unhook the button, shove it through the window, and pull the door to my left. I do as instructed and exit the cell. \n\nI'm led to an interrogation room and the guards let me eat my breakfast. \"Here,\" says the female guard. \"I've got some splenda for ya too.\" I take it gratefully and wash my breakfast down with the coffee. I feel better already. I finish and the guards take my tray and mug and dispose of them for me. It's only then that a suited man comes in. \n\n\"Miss Clearwater, I suppose you're wondering why you're here.\"\n\nI sit up straighter. This man sounds authoritative. \"Yes sir. I'd complain but you DID just feed me.\"\n\nThe man cracks what might be a rare smile on his frown lined face. \"Indeed. The circumstances are strange. But the person we aim to interrogate requested you and only you. Now I know that face. Why? I'll tell you. She looks exactly the same as you do and is allegedly you from another dimension.\"\n\nI'm dumbfounded. I don't know what to really respond with. The suited man continues. \"Just be warned, Miss Clearwater. She is very clever.\"\n\n\"Fantastic,\" I said. I'm in no way clever at all. \"I guess bring her in.\"\n\nThe man nods and walks outside. He taps a button on an intercom and goes into the observation room. The door opposite the one I came in and the man left out of opens. Out walks my doppelganger. Her eyes are aglow with a purple light and her hair shimmers with purple energy. \n\n\"Hello... Rhea Clearwater,\" the doppelganger says. \"Ask me who I am.\"\n\n\"Okay, uh... who are you?\"\n\n\"My name is also Rhea Clearwater. But where I'm from, I'm called The Night Witch.\" Her aura sparkled sickly purple sparks. \"I rule my dimension.

Why not just go back?\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear doppelganger. *I'm* not going to do it. *You* are.\" My doppelganger grins evilly as she says this. \n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's simple. I give you access to my abilities, you send me back to my home dimension, then the power corrupts you by its very nature, and you repeat the cycle.

With the power I shall give you, there is no righteous thought you can have that will sway you.\"\n\n\"You might be wrong, you know.\" I said this with confidence but my mind was a little fearful. I didn't show it. \n\nBut she sends a bolt of energy from her eyes at me. Energy courses through my body and... absorbs. My hair begins to glow like hers and my eyes begin to glow like hers as well. I feel like a god. I do what she asks, and send her back to her dimension.\n\nBut now I'm scared. Do I become what she said? No. I won't. This world has super heroes!

How one is chosen for a task is almost entirely opaque, even to the best minds of our time. I've known since I can remember, my parents have known since I was born. Something great would be demanded of me. Something that would change the course of my life, force me to become something utterly unlike the person I had been up to that point. I can see that I must, that failure to set out will lead to a dark future. But I strongly desire to stay home. To defy fate.\n\nI was twelve when my parents sat me down, told me about it. I knew I was destined for something, but they told me other things. That I was special for being marked for such a purpose, and that there would be danger. I told them, \"I just want to stay here, learn a trade and live a normal life.\" There was pain in their eyes as they said, \"You will have to go, son. People have tried to defy this sort of destiny before, and terrible things resulted. You still have years before the ordeal, but when it arrives, you must accept it. The call will come, and you will have to answer.\"\n\nI would stare into the dark at night and consider my future. I would meet new people, do interesting things. But the life of an adventurer did not interest me. I would be transformed, but what if the person I was now did not like the person I would become? I would be hollowed out and supplanted by something else. It was a sort of death, and there was also a risk of actual death, too.\n\nI was seventeen when the call came. I woke up in the night, warmth on my palm. The mark was glowing. I woke my parents, showed them. Tears formed in my mother's eyes, sadness played across my father's face. \"We'll give you money to pay for food and expenses on your way to Cerulean, those chosen always gather there before they embark.\"\n\nCerulean was the largest city for hundreds of miles and the seat of government. It had changed and grown over a long time, parts of it were built over seven hundred years ago. I was traveling with a modestly sized merchant caravan. It would be a five day long journey. Plenty of time to think things over, maybe find a way to escape. I wrapped my hand with a cloth, hoping to avoid the attention the mark might attract. When we stopped for the night, I sat on the periphery, looking up at the stars. I could vanish here, and no one would be the wiser.\n\nThe campfire is winding down when there is a cry in the dark. I am the closest. Without thinking, I go towards the scream. My eyes are well adjusted to the dark. I find a boy, no older than seven, being menaced by a feral dog. I look for a weapon, and find a stone. I throw it at the creature's head as hard as I can. It yelps, then runs off. \"You alright lad?\" \"I... I think so. I was emptying a chamber pot and that thing came out of the dark.\" There is a brief pause, then he looks at my hand. The cloth had fallen off, revealing the mark. \"You're one of the chosen? Here you are saving people, and the quest hasn't even begun!\"\n\nWe ran into others who had come to help, and explained to them what happened. The boy tells everyone about my mark. I am the center of attention, there will be no slipping away into the shadows tonight.\n\nThe next day, we make it to a village called Blisterwort. I try to hide the mark again. I hope to find another caravan heading away from my home and from Cerulean. I ask around, trying to avoid drawing attention to myself. I am about to fall in with another group, when I am tapped on the shoulder, \"Are you Tomas? You are, aren't you. They said they had one of the marked here, and you fit the description. I am Sally.\" She raises her right hand, and shows the glowing mark. Not knowing what else to do, I unwrap my hand. The marks are identical. \"It seems we are both heading to the same journey. It is good not be alone with the responsibility!\"\n\nWe depart, still heading towards Cerulean. I have lost all hope of escaping with another caravan. My last hope is that I can fade away into the crowd once we reach Cerulean. I understand there is a huge number of people there, disappearing into the multitude should be easy enough. Sally seeks me out, trying to start conversations. I reply tersely, I don't want to give an indication that I am still planning to defy destiny.\n\nThe next days pass without incident. We reach Cerulean early in the afternoon. To my horror, there is an official waiting in the market district, specifically looking for those intended for the quest. Sally pulls me towards them. The man looks at our marks, then tasks one of his underlings with taking us to a place called The Hall. The Hall is where all the marked are gathering. I can find no way to escape. It would seem that I am going on a quest after all."}, {"comment_author": "TheFlyingRavenBird", "comment_text": "John, the lost crown prince of the fantasy world Nahba, considers just turning around and going back to bed when he sees the old man sitting on his\u00a0 kitchen table.

The fated eclipse will occur, I will set off through nations and skies, oceans and mountains, great cities and quaint towns. My limits will be more than just tested.\n\n\"In your 26th year, there will be a solar eclipse. After that day, your life will change forever; you will lose a part of yourself, becoming something new. And the world will be better for it.\"\n\nThese words have been ricocheting through my head ever since I heard the eclipse was happening. I had forgotten all about them for the past decade or so. Many things have happened: my family being torn a part, unwanted invaders tormenting me for years, the struggles of living every day waking up each morning just to slog through it all yet again. I'm surprised I even remembered the stupid fortune.\n\nWell, tomorrow's it\u2026I guess there isn't much use in worrying and dreading what's to come. I should probably use tonight to prepare, but I can't kid myself - I'll just continue to sit here, reflecting and letting these anxious feelings eat away at my insides into the early morning hours.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPart II - Journey\n\nThroughout my journey so far, I haven't noticed a part of me change. My anxieties are still tearing me up, and I still suffer each day, waiting for the current one to end and the next one to begin. Perhaps the fortune wasn't meant to happen immediately, I suppose it's only been a few days since the eclipse. If anything though, that worries me even more. I'd just like to get it over with as quickly as possible.\n\nAs I travel through the sky toward a distant nation, I can't help but think of the potential issues I'll face. Firstly, the language barrier. I don't speak their language, they won't speak mine. How will we communicate? What if I spark animosity or offend the wrong people? There's also the issue of me not knowing where to go or how to get anywhere once I arrive. Coupling with the first issue, I won't even be able to ask for directions. Are these people going to think ill of me? Will they berate me? Laugh at me? Hate me? It's not like they are asking my to embark on this quest - it's something that was asked of me.\n\nI'll be arriving soon. I best try to stop thinking about this as much as possible - my stomach will be tossing and turning regardless, so l should just focus on trying to enjoy it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPart III - Growth\n\nI'm not sure when it happened. As these two weeks have passed, I've found myself able to do things I couldn't before. Not only is the language barrier not an issue, I can talk to people with little issue. Before hand, an invisible force inside me wouldn't let me. Any social interaction was incredibly difficult to perform. But now\u2026now I've been conversing (well, as much as one can with a language barrier) with this nation's people and taking part in their culture.\n\nI'm no longer focusing on the negatives as much - I still have every now and then, I'll grant that. However, what's it matter that I got lost multiple times? I didn't inconvenience anyone\u2026plus it was even kind of fun trying to interpret the different train lines and when I got off at the incorrect spots, there were people who would help me out of the goodness of their hearts.\n\nThe eclipse, this journey, and even the unfortunate events I lived through prior - they all lead to this. I've overcome these feelings that have held me back in life. That invisible force no longer binds me. I did lose a part of me. I lost a weakness. These experiences I went through, I've become a new me. I'm excited for tomorrow; I'm excited for what life will bring."}]}, {"post_title": "[WP] You originally started this restaurant as merely a front for a drug smuggling ring.

You report income from a business that had nothing to do with the business, and can then turn that money into expenses, wages, or even an owner salary.  Like any act of fraud, numbers need to be kept reasonable, or else the G-men will come knocking.\n\nClown Burger had been profitable for five years; not an invented income, but people liked bright flavorful deserts, Funny and Very Funny cheeseburgers, and the Onion Rings were red hot.  New items were coming, \"Bozo Chili Sauce\" was good enough to eat with a spoon, but sold with an order of fries it was pure bliss.  And while 'Fearless Chicken' had long been a dad joke, it brought comparisons to a Kentucky Colonel.\n\nTaxes were due.  I had to to report my finances, but I had cleared a 10% operating profit on its own.\n\n///\n\nTen years ago, I was desperate.\n\nThe government still didn't understand marijuana, but they understood it even less than they did today.  You could smoke it, but the talent I had was 'edibles'.  It didn't take long for money to start to pile up, and the Bank would report anything over $10,000.\n\nClown Burger began as a paper fiction, before due diligence demanded I created a store front.  I had to dispose of dyes, so I turned Vanilla Ice Cream into a flavorful and colorful experiment.  I expected to run a loss for a long time, but I had something different, something unique, and in a world where giant chains sell very consistent things, Clown Burger was a bizarre novelty.\n\nI'd fenced off edibles to people, dumped the money into Clown Burger, and narrowed the losses, before reaching break even.  But there was something else to all of this--I'd gotten away with it all.  No one does that forever, not unless there is nothing to reveal.\n\n///\n\nI made my decision.\n\nI would exit the edibles business; I didn't need the money, and I certainly didn't need the risk.  I'd make a couple calls to sell off the old product, and close out that operation.\n\nClown Burger had begun in a bizarre way, but hadn't Pizza Hut been born out of a falling out between brothers?  Wasn't McDonalds a family restaurant that got bought out by the ice cream machine vendor?  Clown Burger didn't need an illegal off book activity, and neither did I.  It was time to set an old way of life aside.\n\nIndeed, it was time to head to the kitchen:  What if Potato wedges could be mixed with Bozo Chili?

Once for the forgiveness of his own sins, and second for the forgiveness of the priests\u2019 sins. The priest laid in a pool of his blood, staring up at the painted ceiling of the church. It\u2019s magnificent white clouds, the only glimpse of heaven he would get before his soul was dragged to hell. A punishment that didn\u2019t seem fair from the priest\u2019s perspective.\n\n \n\n\u201cCongratulations, your self-righteous quest is complete. I hope you understand the scale of what you\u2019ve done today, because there are such things as necessary evils. Best of luck to you, kid.\u201d The priest\u2019s last words held no malice behind them, genuinely wishing the best for the kid. Father Luke rolled his neck to the side, watching the boy as his life left him. The knight had the kind eyes of a believer, something he admired before he passed. \n\n \n\n\u201cThere was nothing self-righteous about this, Father Luke. I did it to spare the people of our village. How many have you fed to that thing?\u201d Eric glanced at the priest, crossing his hand over his heart. \u201cMay the lord forgive your sins, for I\u2019m unable to.\u201d He set his blade in its sheath, hoping this would be the last battle to ever take place in this holy house.\n\n \n\nAs he examined the body, something strange caught his eye, a slight blue glimmer of magic coming from the priest\u2019s bloodied palm. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d He squinted, only to feel a bitter touch on his shoulder, a woman\u2019s voice in his ear.\n\n \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate being called a thing.\u201d She clenched her hand, slicing off a piece of flesh from his shoulder. While the pain roared through his body, he knew he had to ignore it. Jumping back, he drew his blade, taking up a stance.\n\n \n\nThe creature had already finished devouring the flesh by the time Eric took his stance, its shadowy form towering over the young knight with a face full of eyes that twitched and blinked whenever it moved. The demon hurt to look at, the sight of it disorientating the young knight. It was like it changed shape whenever his mind got used to looking at it, a constant blur of dark shadows and features.\n\n \n\n\u201cI\u2019ll slay you, beast. For the honor of my god.\u201d The knight\u2019s words lacked resolve, unable to work up the strength to take a step forward.\n\n\u201cGod? Look around you. God left this church decades ago. How else was I able to get in?\u201d A pointed tongue replaced an eye, licking the spot where its cheek should have been. \u201cYou\u2019ll make a fine snack. Without the priest\u2019s agreement, I\u2019ll be allowed to feast as freely as I like.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNo?\u201d It laughed, floating forward, lurching over the knight. \u201cNo? That\u2019s cute. Annie is your little sister, right? I\u2019ll visit her once I\u2019m done with you. I just hope those little bones don\u2019t get caught in my teeth.\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cNo.\u201d The knight sobbed, building up whatever courage he had left, striking his sword at the creature, only to watch his blade break apart, scattering across the marble floor. \u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201d His head fell, dropping beside the dead priest. \u201cNo. PLEASE, I DON\u2019T WANT TO DIE. I DON\u2019T DESERVE TO DIE, I\u2019VE BEEN GOOD. I TRIED MY BEST. MOOOM. PLEASE, MOM.\u201d\n\n \n\nThe demon cackled, letting him sob, enjoying the sight. \u201cHow did a weakling like you kill that priest? Oh, I see. He didn\u2019t have the heart to fight back. I thought he was one of the smart humans, one that understood what needed to be done. Seems he was as flawed as the rest of you. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll tell your mother your last thoughts were of her. Then she can join you.\u201d The demon\u2019s hand wrapped around the knight\u2019s neck, only to drop him, feeling a sharp sting running up her arm.\n\n \n\n\u201cNo! THAT OLD BASTARD. I WON\u2019T LET YOU SEAL ME.\u201d The blue glow stirred even brighter, the priest\u2019s last trick activating now that she was in range. No matter how much she pushed against the magic, the force of his seal was too strong, constantly blocking any attacks she threw at it. She spat fire, curses and ice, anything to break it, but nothing worked. So, she turned her attention to the knight. \u201cIF I\u2019M GOING TO HELL, YOU\u2019RE COMING WITH ME.\u201d\n\n \n Before she snagged the knight, her body faded. That claw going through his body as she vanished. \u201cI\u2019ll see you in hell, priest. I hope you understand you\u2019ve made an enemy for your doomed eternity.\u201d As her voice left the church, the knight rolled onto his back, panting as he stared at the ceiling, trying to catch his breath. \n\n \n\n\u201cFather\u2026. I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t know how bad that thing was.\u201d Out of fear and grief, the knight sobbed, getting no comfort until later that evening, when a nun visited the church. A month after the events at the church, the knight resigned from his duties, wanting to honor the late priest by taking on his position.\n\n \n\nEric still didn\u2019t know if necessary evils existed, but he understood why the priest did what he did. Sacrificing the sick and desperate that came to the church seemed reprehensible until one saw what he was trying to prevent. Sadly for the priest, Eric was the only living person who knew what the priest saw. \n\n \n\n\u201cBrother, can we go home and have dinner?\u201d Annie whined, watching her brother fix the altar. She had promised to help him with his duties, but had grown bored only minutes into helping him. Instead, deciding to jump the church pews while she waited. \u201cCome on\u2026\u201d\n\n \n\n\u201cOne moment, Annie.\u201d When he was happy with the altar\u2019s presentation, he took her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d As he left, he said a silent prayer of thanks to Father Luke, hoping that his prayers were enough to send the man to heaven. Wanting to repay Father Luke for sparing not only his life, but the lives of those that lived in the village. That seal required him to bind his own soul to the demon, which was why he was hesitant to use it, assured he would be stuck in hell with the demon for the rest of time.\n\n \n\nEric, on the other hand, liked to think Father Luke was out of the demon\u2019s grasp. While their souls may be joined, that wouldn\u2019t matter if the two were on different plains of existence. Not even a bound soul would be enough to allow the demon to torment someone in heaven. That\u2019s at least the best Eric could have hoped for as he left the church.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n(If you enjoyed this feel free to check out my subreddit /r/Sadnesslaughs where I'll be posting more of my writing.)"}, {"comment_author": "Tregonial", "comment_text": "It was all over the news.

It was a phrase coined by Kaem'Zan of the Fwakshea, the lead scientist of its empirical ship. When one splits the atoms apart and fuses it with a neighboring particle of the same charge before it is put back together and reformed the ship and everything else on it. It was his nation's proudest scientific miracle for space travel. Capable of blinking across star systems in an instant, it was sought after by everyone on his home planet of Hyunalith. \u00a0\n\n\"Sir, we are finding an unusually high radioactive rating of 5 mega parcels per atom on a certain planet considering the system's sun is just a standard yellow ball.\" The planetary analyst rubbed his chin, the sound of knocking on his hard turtle carapace echoing in the ship's robust design. \"That shouldn't be possible considering its sun is nowhere near the UV index to produce such radiation of this caliber. I think we need to check out this new planet.\" He bowed slightly and was hopeful that his disposition would be appreciated.\u00a0\n\nKaem'Zan struggled to find a reason why they should visit a planet considering their entire purpose was to just map the universe around their home planet. \u00a0\n\n\"Hm. Why do you wish this, hm?\" His voice sounding with malice as usual. \"Do you think it would be good for us to go to a planet that is more radioactive than its surroundings? That doesn't seem very smart.\"\u00a0\n\n\"Well, that's the problem sir. It's radioactive, but only outside the planet. The planet itself is perfectly fine.\" He chimed in quick response hoping that he could sway his mind with speed rather than logic. \"It is extremely unusual for a planet to ward off such high amounts of radioactive particles when its sun isn't producing the necessary catalyst for it. I'm thinking of one of two possibilities: That there is life capable of atom fusion or that the atmosphere is incredibly durable. Both would be an important find, no, sir?\" The Planetary Analyst grinned slyly. He's got him now.\u00a0\n\nKaem'Zan was impressed. He didn't think to scan for life forms on the planet as it was beyond his pay grade. \u00a0\n\n\"Have you been scanning for biological matter on each star system?\" He questioned him like a doctor asking a patient. \"Do you think we would benefit by-\" He stopped himself. It would be huge news if they were the first to discover not only life, but intelligent sentient life. \"On second thought, excuse my rudeness. I believe we will take a closer look at the Planet. \n\n1/8"}, {"comment_author": "Blackraptr", "comment_text": "Show me the elemental composition and atmospheric conditions as well as any other information you deem worthy.\" Kaem'Zan clicked his shoes as he walked away.\u00a0\n\nAlright! His first time meeting the commander of the ship and he has already won him over in conversation. This is gonna be a fun analysis now that he doesn't have to hide it anymore. He began to bounce multiple lasers through its atmosphere analyzing the light refractions and the color the laser produces on each and every particle. \u00a0  \n\u00a0\n\n\"Hm... interesting.\" He squinted his eyes and began to read the small numbers that appeared before him. \"That... is that... what is that.\" He focused further as he read it. \"Why is there such a diverse composition of elements... argon... Oxygen... nitrogen... they're everywhere.\" He couldn't believe his eyes. There were even elements unknown to his vast knowledge. He was ecstatic to find such an incredible planet in space. He calmly got up, brushed off his hide, and sprinted towards the commander.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCAPTAIN! CAPTAIN!\u201d He ran with all his might, forcing others out of the way or they would get tossed aside by his brute force. \u201cTHE PLANET IS A MIRACLE! IT\u2019S GOT ELEMENTS UNKNOWN TO EVEN ME AND AFTER A QUICK ANALYSIS OF IT\u2019S AERIAL COMPONENTS!

You want to go down?\u201d He laughed. \u201cWhy? So, you can collect more scientific anomalies? HA! Fat chance.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\u201cThe radiation was artificially made.\u201d The Planetary Analyst said so in confidence that it would spark interest. \u00a0\n\n\u201cArtificial radiation, hm?\u201d He looked out the ship\u2019s visored window and towards the star. \u201cSo, how much of it around the planet is artificial? If you tell me an appropriate amount, I\u2019ll forget this rudeness you\u2019ve caused by running through into my headquarters.\u201d\u00a0  \n\u00a0\n\n\u201c78% sir.\u201d His face was kept as straight as possible as to not give suspicion to his mind that he could lie, which he wasn\u2019t. \u201cI think sentient life is on that planet.\u201d\u00a0\n\n2/8"}, {"comment_author": "Blackraptr", "comment_text": "Kaem\u2019Zan laughed more.

Please prepare for planetary landing and atmospheric depressurization.\u201d He looked at the analyst. \u201cTell me your name shelled-one.\u201d He clicked his tongue amusingly.\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Teen, Sir.\u201d He bowed fully this time. \u201cThank you for not reprimanding me. I\u2019ll begin analyzing for lifeform composition and its other inhabitants.\u201d \u00a0\n\nTeen went back to his work desk and began running biological scans and data mining frequencies across a wide radio band. He found that global communication was achieved, however, all the channels were empty. Only small sounds and noises remained, as if something completely alien was trying to communicate with itself. He found a lush green and blue marbled world that teemed with carbon-based life. Plants, animals, and everything else in between existed in the skies, on land, in the water, and even in places where light isn\u2019t present. After 8 minutes of this, he was approached by the captain again.\u00a0\n\n\u201cTeen. Status Report?\u201d He was excited to hear more news on the findings before the ship-fall. \u201cTeen.\u201d He said again, this time louder.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHuh- Oh sorry Sir. I was lost in my thoughts. I have found that this planet is filled with an overabundance of life. There are chemical readings everywhere on its land masses, its oceans were polluted in some parts, completely devoid of life outside of a few hardy specimens. It\u2019s thrilling to see such durability in organism evolution, don\u2019t you think?\u201d He maliciously smiled at the reflection on the monitor. \u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful to find new things to study.\u201d\u00a0\n\nKaem\u2019Zan focused his vision on Teen. He was intrigued in his thirst for scientific knowledge but fears it might be his downfall. \u00a0\n\n\u201cI see. What about intelligent life? You said so, since there is artificial radiation, yes?\u201d \u00a0\n\n\u201cYou see, that\u2019s the problem, Captain... there are none. I\u2019m seeing formations of metals and stones and even wooded materials forming what I assume could be alien buildings, but they are vacant. I\u2019ve shot numerous particles in hopes of finding something that would return a biological survey, but I\u2019m only finding large, very large, insectoids that seem to be chattering with themselves.\n\n3/8"}, {"comment_author": "Blackraptr", "comment_text": "I\u2019m not able to decipher them, sadly. Their language matches nothing in our databases and I\u2019m not finding any matches from the alien symbols on some buildings compared to how the insectoids speak.\u201d Teen pursed his lips together. \u201cI think, the original creators of the architecture had gone extinct and met their fate, leaving life on the planet to evolve, thus: The Insectoids.\u201d He smiled with delight. \u00a0\n\nKaem\u2019Zan smiled as well. He walked away. His feet producing that same clicking sound, a warning of the Captain\u2019s Presence.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPrepare to make first contact, teen. We will get you some samples after all.\u201d He held up his hand for a nod of approval and received it. \u201cExcellent.\u201d The sound faded, but not his beating heart. He was overwhelmed with excitement. Oh man, this is it. Fresh subjects, materials, and new ideas of the universe to be meddled with. Teen couldn't contain himself as he thought.\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease take off the Skittering Suits and remain seated for atmospheric decompression and arrival, welcome to an alien world. We are the first to make history.\u201d Kaem\u2019Zan let go of the button and began to let the ship count down and begin. \u00a0\n\nSeveral minutes passed by and they were finally on the planet and ready. Teen had run tests on the air, and it was deemed suitable for us, but it may prove difficult to breathe if we go too high due to how heavy the air is compared to our home planet. When the ship doors opened the crew found themselves bewildered at the sights. The planet was immensely rich in not just materials, but everything from smells, to sights, to even sounds. It didn\u2019t matter where you looked, you could find life everywhere. Organisms that had taken flight, tiny chitin-shelled organisms, smaller insectoids, mammalian life. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWell, Teen you\u2019re lead here. You currently know more than anyone, even I.\u201d Kaem\u2019Zan had met his eyes and wasn\u2019t accepting no for answer. \u201cLead away, Expedition Lead 1.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\u201cR-Right, Captain-.\u201d Then, he heard that same skittering noise from before. \u201cWait.\u201d Teen had removed a listening device capable of showing where sounds waves were coming from and he could then translate the sound waves into a frequency, and finally into a language he can understand.\u00a0\n\n4/8"}, {"comment_author": "Blackraptr", "comment_text": "\u201cThey\u2019re here. Here. Here, them. Look. Look. Many. Turtle creature. Reptiles behind turtle. Insects too. Confused.\u201d Teen was shocked. It was like talking to a child. Nothing was a complete sentence and everything was just words that pointed forward a single clear message. \u201cGun. They have gun. Not Human. Unknown. Scared.\u201d The insects were intelligent, however they were still primitive. Then, he saw one in a bush poking it\u2019s antennae out, probing. \u00a0\n\nHe spoke into the device and relayed the frequency into the insectoid language they spoke, albeit it was a little more advanced than what he was hoping to say back, \u201cWe come in peace. Please show. We wish to talk.\u201d Then, the antennae disappeared as quickly as the message spoke.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt speak language. Ours. What happening. Find the leader. Need smart.\u201d The listening device was picking up more skittering, albeit all too quiet to hear, however he could hear the bushes and grasses rustle.\u00a0\n\n\u201cFollow me if you wish. I have just spoken to them however; We will not harm them. They are still primitive. If we follow them silently, maybe we can find their village.\u201d He walked silently as possible with his large form. Turtle. The fuck is a turtle. It was bothering him how much they already knew. Guns? Humans? Nothing made sense. It was like they were already being taught something and we failed to find the planet before these so called \u201cHumans\u201d.\u00a0\n\nIt was him and 3 others that were ready to brave the planet, including the captain. They walked for a long time coming into close contact with many fauna and flora. Animals looked at them and ran, while some stared at a distance. Sounds of liquid water could be heard which was strange considering liquid water was considered only to be possible on Death Worlds due to their high probability of intense apex species, which was a problem considering they weren\u2019t armed very well. It made him uneasy.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCaptain, does anyone one have a weapon on them? I think... this could qualify as a death world.\u201d Kaem\u2019Zan froze in place as he looked around cautiously and pulled out a large, bladed staff, the Kensho. \u00a0\n\n\u201cShall I lead the charge, then?\u201d He walked ahead of them and listened carefully for anything could even be a threat. They walked for a while as they tailed them. They got better glimpses of them as they walked in to a clearing. They were very, very large insectoids with wings and 6 appendages.\n\n5/8"}, {"comment_author": "Blackraptr", "comment_text": "They often crawled on all 6 legs at alarming speeds which would be a problem if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that they are also bipedally walked once they got out of the forest. They were capable of language, although once we saw their village it was clear they hadn\u2019t even a written language however, could easily produce fire and tools of surprisingly good quality.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThese fuckers are fast, huh.\u201d Teen said with bloodlust in his voice eager to get samples and start testing. \u201cThey are rather clever for how intelligent they are. I am worried about these Human people they mentioned. Maybe a false deity.\u201d He wrote it down on a note pad someone was holding, the designated notes person. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be too much a problem. They seemed pretty scared of our armaments. They even called something a \u201cgun\u201d. Whatever that means.\u201d Teen cleared his throat as pronouncing words in his own language using their translation was very strenuous. \u201cI think we should go down there before they leave with their \u201cLead\u201d. \u00a0\n\nThey approached the village and carefully made sure that they were being loud so they wouldn\u2019t freak anything out.\u00a0\n\nHe spoke into the listening device, it\u2019s translations slowly getting better through consistent use of hearing their tongue. It was determined that they called their language \u201cEnglish\u201d, but said the wish their masters were still here to teach them more things before they had to depart. \u00a0\n\nThey walked into the village and were met by immediate action as what I could assume to be soldiers marched to us with 8 legs this time and sharp looking weapons.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d They held up their hands as the captain used the Kensho to cut the weapons they used in half with ease. \u201cTh-thanks, hehe.\u201d His laughter was forced as he was nearly killed by both the captain and the bug\u2019s advance.\u00a0\n\nThe insectoids made their noise of language and I waited for a translation. You not human. Explain or be wiped off the Earth. The device was improving significantly in their speech and pattern recognitions and was now able to give a detailed alphabet of 24 characters. Teen spoke into the device for it to radio back. What is Earth? Who are the Humans and what are you? We are the First Contact Vessel Venxrex of the Hyunalith. We hope for peace.\u00a0\n\n6/8"}, {"comment_author": "Blackraptr", "comment_text": "The insectoids had looked at each other before speaking. \u00a0\n\n\u201cWe are Cockroaches. We do not know the meaning of the word, but Humans called us this. They realized that we were going to be the next intelligent life form on Earth, the planet, and imparted to us their vast knowledge throughout their 360,000 years of evolutionary expansion from Ape to Man. They used to be an apex specie on earth, until they had a devastating war. They were forced to flee the planet after the United Front won. They understood how durable we were and tasked us with the power of removing the radiation and toxic waste from Earth. If peace is what you wish, then we can accomodate you, but only you. The man with the staff is intimidating.\u201d They looked at captain with prying eyes.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCaptain Kame\u2019Zan, they willl only allow me to follow them due to your menacing aura. I think I will be fine. They seem to be far more intelligent than I had originally thought. I think you should go back to the ship. I will return once I have satisfied with the information. Please, I ask this selfish request.\u201d He bowed deeply and waited for Kaem\u2019Zan to decapitate him where he stood.\u00a0\n\n\u201cHmmm. I shall grant it. Don\u2019t be late before night fall. I hope you know the cycle of this planet, because we will not come for you and will be closing the ship and sleeping on the surface. If you don\u2019t make it. You will survive on your own. Understood?\u201d His tone was harsh, as if he didn\u2019t want me to stay alone and used this as a means of punishment.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d I began walking towards the Cockroaches as they cautiously looked me up and down. \u00a0\n\nTheir leader was just a slightly bigger cockroach that looked as if it had mutated. It\u2019s skin was pale and colored purely unlike its other kind. \u00a0\n\n\u201cHello, the one from space. I am Cheech, Lead Director of the village in the east. Sit down and we shall begin.\u201d Its noisy language was much firmer and confident in how it spoke.\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou must be the Smart One I eavesdropped on.\u201d The alphabet had been updated to include two more letters for a grand total of 26 characters and the device deemed it was a completed alphabet, but further analysis would be required. \u201cTell me more about the Humans first. I believe their history was the origin point of you guys and I would like to know about your uh... condition.\u201d\n\n7/8"}, {"comment_author": "Blackraptr", "comment_text": "Teen gestured towards his pale complexion, while the cockroach did what I could only assume to be a laugh as terrifying as it was.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe humans were an apex specie that evolved from monkeys, a mammal. If you asked the others the same question, then I presume you heard of the war? I will tell you more later. However, to answer your simplest question first: I am an Albino. A term coined by the Humans meaning, \u2018to be born without color.\u2019 I was simply born white rather than the standard darker complexion of my brethren.\u201d He clicked happily as we talked. Turns out the humans had abandoned their planet and fled underground to a planet called \u201cMars\u201d. When I asked them how they were capable of hiding their traces from our planetary scans, Cheech wasn\u2019t sure as he was the smartest in the village, but the Humans didn\u2019t tell them unnecessary information. They told them to use their durable bodies to absorb the radiation and shed their molts to dispose of the radiation in a timely manner. They were told to put all their irradiated molts and other objects into a large tube the Humans built before they left. This tube somehow launches things into what the Humans called, \u201cSpace.\u201d Which I determined to be the equivalent to what we call, \u201cUervun.\u201d I was ecstatic. I ate something called a \u201ccow\u201d which looked like they have mastered husbandry and frequently also hunted. They were opportunistic scavengers at heart, but their recent few decades of exponential growth led them to mainly be carnivores \u2013 a term Humans used to describe organisms that only thrive on eating other organisms. \u00a0\n\nAfter a few hours, I realized the sky was getting dark and I was about an hour travel from the ship.\u00a0However, thankfully Cheech had a team of cockroaches to escort me quickly as I rode their backs. They were very cold, almost chilling, massive muscle and fibrous bound insectoids. The one thing Cheech couldn\u2019t tell me was how the atmosphere of your planet was able to withstand such radiation and UV rays while not breaking down. He suspected Human engineering, but ultimately could not tell me as he didn\u2019t even know himself.\u00a0\n\nI got back to the ship and told everyone of my great conversation with tier leader, Cheech the Albino Cockroach. After we returned to our home planet, word spread, and we were decorated and rewarded. A month later we returned for a more semi-permanent stay to help my understanding with them. \u00a0\n\n8/8\n\nHope you enjoyed it!"}, {"comment_author": "YellowSkar", "comment_text": "Incredible....
