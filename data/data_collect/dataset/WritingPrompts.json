Qualities like this include:\n\n* **Tired** \\- A character who is just exhausted with *something*.  Whether it's physically tired of the day, tired of dealing with someone or something, tired of the stress, or just *anything* that makes their shoulder's slump and that slight, mouth-agape-frown.  Think Tony Stark from Infinity War dealing with the Guardians of the Galaxy.  Think Kratos from the new God of War games.  People who just want to rest but *can't*.\n* **Confused** \\- A character who has no idea what's going on and can't figure it out.  A fish out of water.  A peasant being paraded around in a royal court, unaware of the political intrigue.\n* **Overwhelmed** \\- A character who *does* know what's going on but can't do anything about it.  There are too many things to deal with, too many lives in the balance, too many sides to negotiate.\n* **Willfully Ignorant** \\- A character who knows there's more than what it seems but is choosing (for various reasons) to overlook it.  Burn down that building that they've been assured is empty and not full of children to save their loved one?  Whelp it's a good thing it's night and they'll be well out of earshot before any screaming may or may not be heard.\n* **Angry** \\- Straight up angry characters.  Not emotionally brooding ones who are silently seething with a smile as their victems chat calmly around them.  Give me Kylo Ren roaring in rage as he slashes up computer consoles impotently with his lightsaber.  Give me Hulk."}, {"comment_author": "MajorParadox", "comment_text": "Good choices!"}, {"comment_author": "xwhy", "comment_text": "If they're relatable, they're good, or there's good in them that can be brought out.

Most of the ones in our local area are, but as you move farther out, they get stranger, but they all seem to have some human emotion that the reader can grab a hold of. \n\nI have a lot of relatable characters, some more than others, over in r/xwhy.

They have so much power, but all the magic in the world and within their grasp can't solve their social awkwardness and struggles to live alongside others, relate to humans and the people they try to care about.\n\nIt probably stems from growing up as a gifted and neurodiverse child who could never fit in with everyone else in school. I could count the number of friends I keep in touch with from my schooling years with one hand. Always felt like some weirdo alien wearing a human skin who never understood all these hidden social rules and facial cues.  And despite how everyone says I'll be able to figure out all these emotional, human things eventually, stop alienating people by strange behaviors and being really weird abt things because \"omg you're so smart why can't you get it?\"...I still don't. Still fucking clueless as hell.\n\nSo, sometimes, I give my non-human characters someone I wish I had. A human foil and friend to bounce off. A nice human to show them the good in the world.\n\nIn retrospect, its a recurring pattern in my responses to writing prompts. And for some reason the non-human is usually male and the nice human is female, I don't know why.\n\n[Elbert](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1bsts4h/wp_every_time_you_die_you_receive_points_based_on/kxije2i/) has Samantha, Laura is the only one who believes [Mr. Hopper](https://www.reddit.com/r/TregonialWrites/comments/1brmogt/youre_a_dimensionhopper_who_can_walk_through/kx9y9c8/) can save all the worlds, [Lord Elvari](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1ayhpss/ot_fun_trope_friday_writing_with_tropes_road_trip/ksiiwqh/) has Kat, Sarah is supportive of [Vindalos](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1ajh22c/piscientists_revive_a_dead_god_through_prayer_and/), and there's definitely others I don't remember right now.\n\nAs for me, having joined WP reddit and discord, it feels like the Fun Trope Friday (FTF) gang is the \"nice human\" to the silly tentacle writer here.

I've always found little creative writing projects to do. Lately, I've been trying to focus my attention on longer form projects, but short form just seems to hit the sweet spot for me.\n* **What is your writing motivation?**\u00a0Hmm, it depends on the format. With\u00a0[](https://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompts/), I like to view the prompts as puzzles to be solved, or a chance to exercise certain muscles (e.g. scene description, dialogue, inner monologue, etc). Overall, I'd say I'm motivated by the desire to shape ideas into coherent, relatable and funny bits in order to court sweet, sweet upvotes.\n* **What programs do you use to write?**\u00a0For longer form things, Scrivener.

However, my laptop is elevated, and I'm sure if I put it directly on the desk, I could do it faster.\n\nAs for the OT post: interesting question. There are all sorts of things I find relatable in all manner of characters. That's the goal of good character writing, after all, isn't it? To color them with the sort of characteristics that make them feel real and... relatable. However, the characters I most *enjoy* reading are dry wits (e.g. Wodehouse's Jeeves) or the delusional and grandiose blowhards (e.g. Ignatius J Reilly)."}, {"comment_author": "MajorParadox", "comment_text": "Good answer!

I find it an amusing angle to read from as well because I myself am anxious and then compare if I\u2019m like that while laughing at myself. \n\nAnother would be the over-possessive male. Easy to write for and I just enjoy writing out details of body language and facial expressions. Reading for that character gives inspiration. Plus it\u2019s just- everywhere right now on BookTok. \n\nI enjoy overwhelmed characters that sort of ties into anxious. When they finally have their moment and explode it\u2019s always a cathartic read. \n\nI would say that finally I enjoy the quiet guy.

These characters are the most realistic, in my opinion. Chances are, should anyone be sent to an alternate world or anything, they won't run around doing edgy stuff or killing demon lords or any of that. They would probably settle down somewhere and live peacefully while following the law and the economy. (fr most of you won't even last in a swordfight because of the weight alone, no matter what anime or movies say)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nB.) I find characters that don't care to be funny, and also, there is some edgy satisfaction in knowing you can fix a problem yet choose not to because it's not your problem, to begin with (ie. not getting involved in a fight because you don't care and not because of some ideological stuff or moral stuff) and its probably not even worth the hassle to get involved (ie. you can get in trouble or have the blame pinned on you if you interfere)\n\nC.) Not only are these types of characters carefree in that no plot device can necessarily compel them to move towards anything, but morality is fairly flexible for these characters, making them easier to write. They don't get boring because I can easily just model the story however I want to without writing myself into a corner because I made them too evil or too good or any of the typical traps authors get trapped in.\n\nD.) Power is not necessary for these characters, and they are probably the most flexible. I can use them for an action story, a wholesome story, a comedy story, etc., without having to change them much, and these characters, beyond being good protagonists, also make good likable side characters due to their reliability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nE.) Greatest of all, authors bias.\n\nThis type of character is my favorite and reflects how I am in real life more than other characters, so yeah.

As well as being able to pull on our heartstrings and suck us into their stories with wonderfully vivid descriptions, they\u2019re also more than capable of injecting a healthy dose of humour into some of their pieces. Plus, as well as sharing their words with us, they\u2019re also great at sharing advice and feedback with other writers.

Apparently the alien needed evidence to show off to her parents. We'd be making for the whole parental meet'n'greet in a couple days. Over the course of the next day and a half, she took me to an alien theme park, a stargazing tour which was really a bunch of trips to other planets to look at local cultures' constellations, and two very nice dinner dates. All the while she lied via her social media that I was the one that took her to all these things. \n\nThe alien theme park is the most interesting theme park I've probably ever been to. Instead of rollercoasters there were Momentum Runs. You become basically an Oozoid from DND and you slip and slide around a very slick pipe. The feeling is unlike anything I've ever witnessed. Instead of bumper cars you have what the theme park called Zap-Your-Friends, which is just a UFO ride where you pilot your own open cockpit UFO and shoot your friends with nonlethal static shock levels of electricity. Probably 500 volt three nanosecond pulses. They also have food from all over the universe for you to enjoy. You're scanned and food from their stock that you can eat illuminates on a picture menu. Point to it, pay in the equivalent of whatever currency you have and enjoy. There are a few arcade games, some from Earth, most from everywhere in the galaxy, and there are even some conventional Earth carnival rides. \n\nThe stargazing tour took us to so many planets. The local people spoke through more universal translators about the cultural significance of their constellations. I couldn't help but draw on the similarities. We immortalized gods and warriors in the heavens. So too did so many other civilizations. On one of the planets, we were asked if anyone was from Earth. Only I raised my hand. I was greeted in English by the tourguide. A hunched over, saurian, four legged and four armed warrior type creature about twice the height of a grizzly bear on its hind legs beckoned me over and groveled at my feet. It is a Silvalek. This member of a warrior race, as well as the rest of his entire race, apparently worship humans as gods. Beats me as to why. Thankfully I didn't stay around long. \n\nThe dinner dates were honestly some of the best I ever went to. All my food was delicious, even if the alien fare looked absolutely awful. Turns out the alien I'm with is a carnivore. Some of the meat she was eating looked a lot like vegetables, or what I could assume was a vegetable. We went to the home of the Silvalek for one of the dinner dates. At this point, the alien was just trying to mess with me. Even the Silvalek king King Throk came and bid me homage. Literally hundreds lined up outside to fall to their four knees in worship. Silvalek are also carnivores and their staple food is, in Human language, Irik. Irik are chihuahua sized lizard cats that the Silvalek keep as a \"staple crop.\" They taste... Like a weird mix of pork and chicken. Despite the fattiness of some of the cuts, the meat tastes very good. I felt really invigorated after eating it. Must be packed with nutrients and energy. Enough to supply a two-ton silvalek warrior. \n\n\\[1/2\\]"}, {"comment_author": "Scorppio500", "comment_text": "\\[2/2\\]\n\nAfter our dates, and a good night rest, it is finally time to meet the parents of the alien. Throughout all this, she had never given me her name. So while we were en-route to her parents' house, I asked her. \n\nShe looks at me with those beautiful amethyst eyes and says her name. \"Amethyst.\" I smiled in relief. It's not something I can't pronounce. \n\n\"I don't believe I caught your name,\" she says. \n\n\"Oh, right. I'm Emily. But just call me Emile. At least... until we're clear of your parents.\" I smile sheepishly. Really should've introduced myself early on. Awkward. We both end up smiling awkwardly. \n\n\"Okay, Emile, I'm sure my parents will love you!\" Amethyst giggles a bit. God, she's so pretty. \n\nOur little transport docks at a big alien starport. Giant bugfolk check us in for disembarking and come aboard to do a security sweep. Finding a me, a human, they say something to Amethyst in their bugspeak which my translator has a hard time deciphering, but the gist of it was that I need a pressure suit. The bugs exit the airlock and return with a measuring device. They scan me with it, and the space suit they brought in seems to change in size to match my size. I quickly put it on over my clothes. \n\nAmethyst doesn't need a pressure suit. Just a breathing mask. Apparently the reason for all this is because the docking bays area is all depressurized due to a malfunction in the airlocks. Some meddling Lombax accidentally blew the hyperbolic rayshield stabilizers trying to make it function better. At least they tried. I noticed the bugfolk didn't seem to need pressure suits. I guess their exoskeleton and tubes on their tubercles were all they needed. \n\nI was helped along by a bugfok, whose species I learned to be a Hektar, to walk across the low gravity section into the artificial gravity field. It was much easier to walk after that. \n\nThe meeting itself? I had been dreading it for some time. Turns out, it was totally fine. Amethyst's parents are really cool and they knew enough about humans to scare me into thinking the entire ruse would be for naught. But turns out, the ruse did in fact work. Her parents approved of me and we finally got to go back to Earth. \n\nUnfortunately upon departing from the place, Amethyst gets a text message on her comm unit. \"Make sure to bring Emile back with you sometime next week! We want to have him over for dinner! Get to know him a bit better!\" Amethyst looks at me with an \"oh shit\" look in her six beautiful eyes. \n\n\"I guess,\" Amethyst says \"You're going to have to keep doing this for awhile, eh?\"\n\nI look at her and smile. \"If you bring me to places like you've been doing, sure. But why not come spend time on earth? I'd be happy to have the company.\" \n\nAmethyst looked at me joyfully. That smile could light up a city. \"Really? You'd do it? Oh thank you! My parents can be the worst!\"\n\n\"No, really,\" I said, \"I'd enjoy it very much. You're kinder than most humans I've met, and not gonna lie, you're gorgeous. I'm happy just to be around you.\"\n\nWas it impulse? Maybe it was. But as soon as I stopped talking, Amethyst kissed me. On the lips. \"Sorry,\" she said after our lips parted. \"I don't know what I was thinking. I shouldn't have done that just now.\"\n\n\"Why?\" I said. \"It felt nice. You should do that more often.\"\n\nAnd she did. More than a couple times. I stepped foot on earth covered in purple lip marks, and I had the biggest smile on my face. No one will believe me, but that doesn't matter. I guess I've got an alien girlfriend."}, {"comment_author": "brokeanail", "comment_text": "Left me with a smile.

I blinked, and raised my hands.\n\n\"No, no, not broken, I understood you just fine.\" I put a hand on my hip, raising the other one, palm up, to wave at her...ship? sitting in the middle of my corn field. \"But...really? This is the sort of thing we read in cheap tabloids at the supermarket or on downvoted posts on reddit.\"\n\nShe turned and looked back at her ship, then back at me. Her eyes went from my face, down my bare chest and jeans, to my boots. Then, she looked past me at the small house.\n\n\"I am so sorry for being cliche like this,\" she started apologizing. For a cerulean-skinned, hairless alien, she was surprisingly human in form and mannerisms. \"We've seen some of these stories and how they always involve orifice probes and never people from cities and\u2014\"\n\n\"Well, you didn't make that mistake this time...I moved out here to get away from the constant crowds of the city.\"\n\n\"So you're not a...hick?\"\n\n\"I probably would be now; but I used to be an urban video game player.\"\n\nShe smiled, and her evenly-colored, pupilless jade eyes seemed to sparkle. I noticed her teeth seemed to be unusually smooth and even; but after a few seconds, I realized she had only two \"teeth,\" one above and one below, like an animal trap.\n\n\"Look, Miss..?\"\n\n\"Kyliasha,\" she supplied, \"but call me Ky.\"\n\n\"Ky. Let me get my shirt from the tractor seat, and we can go inside and talk about it for a few minutes over coffee.\"\n\nI turned and pulled the t-shirt\u2014an old G'nR shirt my dad had had\u2014from the seat. As I doffed my straw cowboy hat to pull it on, Ky turned toward her ship and pressed a few entries on a device on her forearm. The four-winged, ovular teardrop share seemed to shimmer before dots on its surface began to disappear, like falling rain drops soaking the surface into invisibility.\n\nAs we walked back to my house, I had to ask the question.\n\n\"So, Miss Ky, you seem very human, aside from a couple of surface differences.\"\n\n\"Oh? Well, that's probably because I am. Or perhaps you're Nirau...that's my base species. It's a common physiological template for carbon-based macrocellular species across the galaxy, with a studied genetic compatibility that hints all Nirau\u2014and possibly your species as well\u2014share a common ancestor species, long since lost to time, with differences being largely the result of adaptation to different environmental circumstances.\"\n\n\"So...you actually *are* a girl?\"\n\n\"Would you like to confirm?\" Her fingers went to her suit collar, and I held up my hands.\n\n\"No! Nono no, I'll take your word for it. Not going to take advantage of the pretty girl with blue skin who asked me on a date.\"\n\n\"You are physically attractive yourself...\"\n\n\"Thomas. Or Tom.\"\n\n\"...Tom.\" She smiled up at me again, and I could feel my heart thumping in my chest. She seemed to look away before saying,\n\n\"It wasn't strictly by chance. I've been scouting you for two days...when you aren't farming, you have a healthy stream of communication in and out, and you are physically quite attractive. Your residence indicated you are unattached. So...I made contact. And I really *am* in quite a bind on this matter, so I do hope you'll say yes.\"\n\n[TBC]"}, {"comment_author": "Kempeth", "comment_text": "It was a weird sensation. A Tingling that gradually spread from my extremities to my very core, accompanied by an eerie huming sound. And to the eyes it felt like the visual equivalent of a shoddy music crossfade on the radio. One moment I was walking from the shower back to my room, the next moment I'm standing on a kind of glass pedestal. A girl, roughly my age, was standing opposite me behind some a podium or console. She excitedly tapped a few buttons before she rushed over to me. *\"Is this translator working?\"*\n\n\"Huh?\" was the first somewhat coherent word that made it past my hangover from last night. \"What happened? Where am I?\"\n\nThe girl spoke some words I couldn't recognize, then the whole room underwent a noticable jolt, like a train that began to move. *\"Listen. I need you to pretend to be my boyfriend for three days so my parents will get off my back about it.\"*\n\n\"Kathrin?\" - *\"Yes! You remember!\"* Even in my groggy state she was impossible not to recognize. Cute as a button, delicate freckles, gorgeous auburn locks, she was even still wearing her pitch black contact lenses. I was kicking myself the whole way home and then some for not asking her number. But wait a minute!\n\n\"Yes! I was hoping to see you again. But I would still like an answer to my questions!\" My synapses were slowly starting to fire. Kathrin had coaxed me off the glass platform and we were now standing on the *softest* carpet of the world, possibly even the universe. The walls were intricate and luxurious, violet and purple patterns with gold trims. Between them metallic frames and to you right a handleless door with strange characters printed on it.\n\n*\"Of course, but lets go to the lounge. Do you want something to drink?\"* - \"Oh yes, please! I slightly overdid it last night!\" We made our way into a narrow corridor past some stairs to another door. As it opened it revealed a massive seamless window front through which I could see stars streak by more impressively than a long exposure of the perseid meteoroid shower. I could not help myself but stagger back from the awe of it.\n\nAfter I had regained my composure, we sat down at a table, breakfast appeared out of thin air and equally long awaited explanations started to come forth as well. Yes, this was a starship. Yes, we were travelling faster than light to her home system. And no, she was not wearing contact lenses. She was an alien from an influential family on her planet and she needed someone to accompany her to a relative's wedding.\n\n\"That... raised at least as many questions as it answered!\" - *\"Like?\"* - \"Your name is Kathrin? Not Klibrit or something more alien sounding?\" - *\"Well... It is a... reasonable rendering in your language and it's adorable that after all these revelations this is your first question about all of it.

It does that every evening for eight hours.\n\nI wasn't about to be caught in gridlock traffic just to stand in a crowd on a hill staring up at the sky with my mouth open like some slack-jawed moron. Why did the moon's shadow have to pass over my house directly? Door Dash was going to cost me a bajillion dollars because everyone wanted to come see this thing. My dad and sister were all abuzz about it, calling me an old stick in the mud, but if Mom were alive, she'd understand. \n\nI paused my game and looked out the window. It was still dark out. I checked the clock on my PS5 interface. It should have ended by now. I shrugged and loaded in for another game. When the round finished and the results screen detailed everyone's scores, I looked through the window again.\n \nStill dark.\n\nAfter a couple more games, I checked my phone. It looked like every source clocked the eclipse at only about 5 minutes\u2014 at the least the total darkness part of it. And my house was about 15 minutes away from an area where you could view the eclipse in its full totality. It wasn't adding up.\n\nAfter an hour of darkness, I decided to call my dad. Then my sister. Then my cousins. \nAll straight to voicemail. \n\nI shut the game off, grabbed my keys, and left the house. I didn't look directly at the eclipse, but it was definitely still hovering there. I hopped in my car and pushed the start button. I knew where my family was. They had secured a reservation at our church's retreat. It was private property, and they were charging $10 a person to try and thin out the big families that had come together from other areas.\n\nThe road was completely clear. I hadn't seen anything like it since the height of Covid. I cruised down the interstate all the way to the retreat and pulled into the packed parking lot. I took a handicapped spot right next to the door and made my way inside. I walked through the quiet empty building and out the other side.\n\nAnd when I passed through the door and stepped out onto the walkway, the sight was chilling.\nHundreds and hundreds of people stood, nearly shoulder to shoulder, staring up at the eclipse through special glasses meant to make the viewing safe. Their mouths were wide open, their faces frozen, twisted up in an expression of surprise and horror. It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. \n\nAnd it had everything to do with the silence. \n\nNobody was talking. Nobody was moving. It was as though they had been petrified in place. I slowly walked up to one of them and waved my hand in front of their face. No response. I looked to the next. \n\n\"Hello?\"\n\nNothing. \n\nNow I was worried.\n\nI began pushing through the crowd, calling for my dad and my sister. After combing through the masses for several minutes, I began to realize how hopeless the endeavor was. It was playing Where's Waldo from a ground perspective. I quickly checked my phone to see if this phenomenon was worldwide, but there was nothing about it yet. \n\nIn a fit of frustration, I turned to the nearest woman and shook her by the shoulders, yelling in her face, and slapping her cheeks, but there was no response at all. I walked up to the man next to her and plugged his nose, stuck my finger in his mouth, and finally shoved him. He didn't bother to keep his balance. He fell backward into the guy behind him and sort of just leaned there like he was all drugged out.\n\nFinally, I snatched the glasses of the woman and put them on. I turned around and stared up at the eclipse. My body turned instantly cold. My breathing stopped. I heard a snapping a sizzling sound just beneath my skin as I stared up at the monster in the sky.\n\nIt was wholly indescribable no matter how long I beheld it. \n\nIt took up almost the entire sky. Its body was shiny and black. Dark appendages that blew gently like giant streamers in the breeze branched off of its main body, where insectoid legs slowly kicked not unlike a bug grasping for solid earth after being picked up. I heard a terrible noise like a boathorn that shook the earth beneath my feet. I began to hear screaming all around me, but the voices didn't sound like people's. \n\nIt was a high-pitched screech\u2014 a noise one might expect from a deep sea creature communicating to others around it. \n\nI felt my stomach tighten. I couldn't look away.\n\nI didn't want to look away.\n\nI liked being cold.\n\nI didn't need to breathe.\n\nAnd the sizzling under my skin was like a spa day for my muscular system.\n\nI felt completely relaxed. And as the creature drew nearer, I began to understand, almost innately, that the screeching noise around me was the planet itself. The grass, the trees, the shrubs... it all wailed in unison for the first time.\n\nFear? Joy?\n\nI was about to find out which.\n\nr/A15MinuteMythos // reyathenswrites.com"}]}, {"post_title": "[WP] You have plucked up the courage to tell your crush how you feel about her, but she has something she wants to confide in you - she is pregnant and the father is a mythical monster.", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1byxjt3/wp_you_have_plucked_up_the_courage_to_tell_your/", "post_main_text": "", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "AutoModerator", "comment_text": "**Welcome to the Prompt!** All top-level comments must be a story or poem.

You have clearly spoken enough on this issue.\"\n\nThe old man fell silent, but still glared at Sir Lang, who took the hand of this sacrificial woman and led her into the forest.\n\nThe moment they were out of sight of the village, Sir Lang found a branch of white berries and held it high above his head as they continued. \"So, what got you sacrificed?\" Sir Lang asked.\n\n\"I asked my parents to let me leave. I said I wanted to be free of this village. They hadn't cared for me... no one did. But they took that as me wanting to be fed to a werewolf.\" The woman said as they trudged through the thickening bushes.\n\n\"Well, the good news is that you do have options.\" Sir Land continued, \"you no doubt heard me explain, in less than elegant terms, that this werewolf is likely turning each sacrifice. So you could very well join the pack. I'm not to judge. Alternatively, I could name you a squire. It's decent pay, and you don't need any family titles when you have sponsorship. My father was a sponsored squire after he helped save the first session of parliament from an insurrection. I could also drop you off at any number of towns with my gold purse to do as you wish.\"\n\nThe moon reflected in the woman's eyes as she replied, \"Thank you. I'm still in disbelief that werewolves are so...\" She looked outwards into the forest, meeting the gaze of two yellow eyes in the brush, which moved forward and revealed their owner. A large werewolf with fur like the ash of a campfire.\n\nThe werewolf spoke in a (clearly rehersed) viscous growl, \"Ah! Another tasty sacrifice. On a silver platter too!\" The woman gasped, but Sir Lang stood still.\n\n\"The jig is up. I know your pack of outcasts is nearby. I only want to talk. And perhaps you can make your number ten tonight.\"\n\nThey werewolf made a brief howl, and seven more pairs of piercing yellow eyes emerged from the forest. He replied in a softer tone, \"Eight. Two didn't make it in the cold before we could find them. And I don't want to raid the village.\"\n\nSir Land replied, \"I know that. But it's still advisable if you and your pack came with me. The current parliament is very generous to many manner of cryptids. If you cooperate, you are guaranteed a generous domain of protected wilderness.\"\n\n\"Tempting,\" The werewolf admitted, \"But I like this area. The village kicks out all the people with the best traits to be in a werewolf pack. It's a good place to grow this family.\"\n\n\"How about one more and you move south?\" The woman spoke up, \"I'll let you turn me. The southern valley was over-grazed after the last of the regular wolves were hunted down. The village kinda needs you now.\"\n\n\"Careful, that's a hard demand I'd have to make of the local lord. And he is known to but heads with the new parliament.\" Sir Lang warned, \"But I suppose the parliament can reassign the county to a different family.\"\n\n\"I'll agree to this.

He tried to run toward Nicole but the lead werewolf cut his path, its mouth salivating.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cDon\u2019t thank me yet, Mayor.\u201d Nicole pointed her gun at the lead werewolf.

Secondly, if I do find more than just the one werewolf, you owe me the same bounty for each head I bring back, the silver not included.\" The villagers all paled when they considered the cost and before they could object I explained my thoughts. \"If it were simply one beast, I could take it down without much worry for my life. I've dealt with their kind before. However now that there's a good potential that there's a whole pack of them, i have to worry about being attacked from all angles even when engaged with the original. Silver armor isn't exactly cheap, or practical to fight much other than a few select monsters, so I'll have to improvise with whatever you have.

But at least they haven't promised the world and then tried to kill me to get out of paying their due. \"I may kill monsters, but I'm not a monster myself. How about this, I'll do the deed, and my original price still stands, but we can spread out the payments. One on return, and then let's say another payment every month for as many months as I bring back heads.

The one thing I know about werewolves is they love pattern so I asked the chief where he meets the wolf, I was told the entrance of the village. I decided that my best course of action was to stay at their overnight inn, I put my sword right by my bedside and I shut off the lamp. *Crack* I woke up in a startle and turned on my lamp. There it was, 7 foot, black fur, large claws, piercing gaze, large ears, and a very muscular build. Weird thing was it had a familiar smell, the smell of the village.

Then I awaken... in a very nicely furnished jail cell? What is this, the SCP foundation? \n\nTurns out I'd be closer to the correct answer than I thought. This is a cell in the USP Florence ADMAX facility. Says so on the wall. The supermax prison not too far from the city I live in. I feel like garbage. I must've been chloroformed or something. \n\nI don't remember coming here at all. I was still in my sexy lingerie my boyfriend got me and my kitty ears and tie-on tail. I'll bet carrying me while I was unconscious wearing this was awkward. I sent up a silent prayer the agents that took me here weren't weirded out. I might've also got really drunk last night, so on top of the chloroforming or other sedation method, the ick feeling was compounded by my clearly hungover state. I saw some mismatched clothing with the tags still on them sitting in the bunk across from the sofa I was laying on. I put those on. \n\nThere is a button on the wall with a note that says \"When you're up and dressed, press this. We'll bring you a coffee and some warm breakfast.\" The wire ran through the window to the veritable blast door which was removed so it could be run. I laced on the standard prison shoes and pressed the button. \n\nTwo armed security guards appeared at my door. One has a coffee in his hand, the other has a quite nice looking breakfast under a clear cloche carefully positioned under her arm. She asks me to unhook the button, shove it through the window, and pull the door to my left. I do as instructed and exit the cell. \n\nI'm led to an interrogation room and the guards let me eat my breakfast. \"Here,\" says the female guard. \"I've got some splenda for ya too.\" I take it gratefully and wash my breakfast down with the coffee. I feel better already. I finish and the guards take my tray and mug and dispose of them for me. It's only then that a suited man comes in. \n\n\"Miss Clearwater, I suppose you're wondering why you're here.\"\n\nI sit up straighter. This man sounds authoritative. \"Yes sir. I'd complain but you DID just feed me.\"\n\nThe man cracks what might be a rare smile on his frown lined face. \"Indeed. The circumstances are strange. But the person we aim to interrogate requested you and only you. Now I know that face. Why? I'll tell you. She looks exactly the same as you do and is allegedly you from another dimension.\"\n\nI'm dumbfounded. I don't know what to really respond with. The suited man continues. \"Just be warned, Miss Clearwater. She is very clever.\"\n\n\"Fantastic,\" I said. I'm in no way clever at all. \"I guess bring her in.\"\n\nThe man nods and walks outside. He taps a button on an intercom and goes into the observation room. The door opposite the one I came in and the man left out of opens. Out walks my doppelganger. Her eyes are aglow with a purple light and her hair shimmers with purple energy. \n\n\"Hello... Rhea Clearwater,\" the doppelganger says. \"Ask me who I am.\"\n\n\"Okay, uh... who are you?\"\n\n\"My name is also Rhea Clearwater. But where I'm from, I'm called The Night Witch.\" Her aura sparkled sickly purple sparks. \"I rule my dimension. And I shall rule here as well.\"\n\n\"Why?\" You'd think I'd be scared, but I'm not. \"What reason is there for that? Why not just go back?\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear doppelganger. *I'm* not going to do it. *You* are.\" My doppelganger grins evilly as she says this. \n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's simple. I give you access to my abilities, you send me back to my home dimension, then the power corrupts you by its very nature, and you repeat the cycle. Soon the world will be yours!\"\n\n\"And if I aim to not take over the world?\"\n\n\"You will want to. With the power I shall give you, there is no righteous thought you can have that will sway you.\"\n\n\"You might be wrong, you know.\" I said this with confidence but my mind was a little fearful. I didn't show it. \n\nBut she sends a bolt of energy from her eyes at me. Energy courses through my body and... absorbs. My hair begins to glow like hers and my eyes begin to glow like hers as well. I feel like a god. I do what she asks, and send her back to her dimension.\n\nBut now I'm scared. Do I become what she said? No. I won't. This world has super heroes!

You report income from a business that had nothing to do with the business, and can then turn that money into expenses, wages, or even an owner salary.  Like any act of fraud, numbers need to be kept reasonable, or else the G-men will come knocking.\n\nClown Burger had been profitable for five years; not an invented income, but people liked bright flavorful deserts, Funny and Very Funny cheeseburgers, and the Onion Rings were red hot.  New items were coming, \"Bozo Chili Sauce\" was good enough to eat with a spoon, but sold with an order of fries it was pure bliss.  And while 'Fearless Chicken' had long been a dad joke, it brought comparisons to a Kentucky Colonel.\n\nTaxes were due.  I had to to report my finances, but I had cleared a 10% operating profit on its own.\n\n///\n\nTen years ago, I was desperate.\n\nThe government still didn't understand marijuana, but they understood it even less than they did today.  You could smoke it, but the talent I had was 'edibles'.  It didn't take long for money to start to pile up, and the Bank would report anything over $10,000.\n\nClown Burger began as a paper fiction, before due diligence demanded I created a store front.  I had to dispose of dyes, so I turned Vanilla Ice Cream into a flavorful and colorful experiment.  I expected to run a loss for a long time, but I had something different, something unique, and in a world where giant chains sell very consistent things, Clown Burger was a bizarre novelty.\n\nI'd fenced off edibles to people, dumped the money into Clown Burger, and narrowed the losses, before reaching break even.  But there was something else to all of this--I'd gotten away with it all.  No one does that forever, not unless there is nothing to reveal.\n\n///\n\nI made my decision.\n\nI would exit the edibles business; I didn't need the money, and I certainly didn't need the risk.  I'd make a couple calls to sell off the old product, and close out that operation.\n\nClown Burger had begun in a bizarre way, but hadn't Pizza Hut been born out of a falling out between brothers?

How one is chosen for a task is almost entirely opaque, even to the best minds of our time. I've known since I can remember, my parents have known since I was born. Something great would be demanded of me. Something that would change the course of my life, force me to become something utterly unlike the person I had been up to that point. I can see that I must, that failure to set out will lead to a dark future. But I strongly desire to stay home. To defy fate.\n\nI was twelve when my parents sat me down, told me about it. I knew I was destined for something, but they told me other things. That I was special for being marked for such a purpose, and that there would be danger. I told them, \"I just want to stay here, learn a trade and live a normal life.\" There was pain in their eyes as they said, \"You will have to go, son. People have tried to defy this sort of destiny before, and terrible things resulted. You still have years before the ordeal, but when it arrives, you must accept it. The call will come, and you will have to answer.\"\n\nI would stare into the dark at night and consider my future. I would meet new people, do interesting things. But the life of an adventurer did not interest me. I would be transformed, but what if the person I was now did not like the person I would become? I would be hollowed out and supplanted by something else. It was a sort of death, and there was also a risk of actual death, too.\n\nI was seventeen when the call came. I woke up in the night, warmth on my palm. The mark was glowing. I woke my parents, showed them. Tears formed in my mother's eyes, sadness played across my father's face. \"We'll give you money to pay for food and expenses on your way to Cerulean, those chosen always gather there before they embark.\"\n\nCerulean was the largest city for hundreds of miles and the seat of government. It had changed and grown over a long time, parts of it were built over seven hundred years ago. I was traveling with a modestly sized merchant caravan. It would be a five day long journey. Plenty of time to think things over, maybe find a way to escape. I wrapped my hand with a cloth, hoping to avoid the attention the mark might attract. When we stopped for the night, I sat on the periphery, looking up at the stars. I could vanish here, and no one would be the wiser.\n\nThe campfire is winding down when there is a cry in the dark. I am the closest. Without thinking, I go towards the scream. My eyes are well adjusted to the dark. I find a boy, no older than seven, being menaced by a feral dog. I look for a weapon, and find a stone. I throw it at the creature's head as hard as I can. It yelps, then runs off. \"You alright lad?\" \"I... I think so. I was emptying a chamber pot and that thing came out of the dark.\" There is a brief pause, then he looks at my hand. The cloth had fallen off, revealing the mark. \"You're one of the chosen? Here you are saving people, and the quest hasn't even begun!\"\n\nWe ran into others who had come to help, and explained to them what happened. The boy tells everyone about my mark. I am the center of attention, there will be no slipping away into the shadows tonight.\n\nThe next day, we make it to a village called Blisterwort. I try to hide the mark again. I hope to find another caravan heading away from my home and from Cerulean. I ask around, trying to avoid drawing attention to myself. I am about to fall in with another group, when I am tapped on the shoulder, \"Are you Tomas? You are, aren't you. They said they had one of the marked here, and you fit the description. I am Sally.\" She raises her right hand, and shows the glowing mark. Not knowing what else to do, I unwrap my hand. The marks are identical. \"It seems we are both heading to the same journey. It is good not be alone with the responsibility!\"\n\nWe depart, still heading towards Cerulean. I have lost all hope of escaping with another caravan. My last hope is that I can fade away into the crowd once we reach Cerulean. I understand there is a huge number of people there, disappearing into the multitude should be easy enough. Sally seeks me out, trying to start conversations. I reply tersely, I don't want to give an indication that I am still planning to defy destiny.\n\nThe next days pass without incident. We reach Cerulean early in the afternoon. To my horror, there is an official waiting in the market district, specifically looking for those intended for the quest. Sally pulls me towards them. The man looks at our marks, then tasks one of his underlings with taking us to a place called The Hall. The Hall is where all the marked are gathering. I can find no way to escape. It would seem that I am going on a quest after all."}, {"comment_author": "TheFlyingRavenBird", "comment_text": "John, the lost crown prince of the fantasy world Nahba, considers just turning around and going back to bed when he sees the old man sitting on his\u00a0 kitchen table.

The fated eclipse will occur, I will set off through nations and skies, oceans and mountains, great cities and quaint towns. My limits will be more than just tested.\n\n\"In your 26th year, there will be a solar eclipse. After that day, your life will change forever; you will lose a part of yourself, becoming something new. And the world will be better for it.\"\n\nThese words have been ricocheting through my head ever since I heard the eclipse was happening. I had forgotten all about them for the past decade or so. Many things have happened: my family being torn a part, unwanted invaders tormenting me for years, the struggles of living every day waking up each morning just to slog through it all yet again. I'm surprised I even remembered the stupid fortune.\n\nWell, tomorrow's it\u2026I guess there isn't much use in worrying and dreading what's to come. I should probably use tonight to prepare, but I can't kid myself - I'll just continue to sit here, reflecting and letting these anxious feelings eat away at my insides into the early morning hours.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPart II - Journey\n\nThroughout my journey so far, I haven't noticed a part of me change. My anxieties are still tearing me up, and I still suffer each day, waiting for the current one to end and the next one to begin. Perhaps the fortune wasn't meant to happen immediately, I suppose it's only been a few days since the eclipse. If anything though, that worries me even more. I'd just like to get it over with as quickly as possible.\n\nAs I travel through the sky toward a distant nation, I can't help but think of the potential issues I'll face. Firstly, the language barrier. I don't speak their language, they won't speak mine. How will we communicate? What if I spark animosity or offend the wrong people? There's also the issue of me not knowing where to go or how to get anywhere once I arrive. Coupling with the first issue, I won't even be able to ask for directions. Are these people going to think ill of me? Will they berate me? Laugh at me? Hate me? It's not like they are asking my to embark on this quest - it's something that was asked of me.\n\nI'll be arriving soon. I best try to stop thinking about this as much as possible - my stomach will be tossing and turning regardless, so l should just focus on trying to enjoy it.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPart III - Growth\n\nI'm not sure when it happened. As these two weeks have passed, I've found myself able to do things I couldn't before. Not only is the language barrier not an issue, I can talk to people with little issue. Before hand, an invisible force inside me wouldn't let me. Any social interaction was incredibly difficult to perform. But now\u2026now I've been conversing (well, as much as one can with a language barrier) with this nation's people and taking part in their culture.\n\nI'm no longer focusing on the negatives as much - I still have every now and then, I'll grant that. However, what's it matter that I got lost multiple times? I didn't inconvenience anyone\u2026plus it was even kind of fun trying to interpret the different train lines and when I got off at the incorrect spots, there were people who would help me out of the goodness of their hearts.\n\nThe eclipse, this journey, and even the unfortunate events I lived through prior - they all lead to this. I've overcome these feelings that have held me back in life. That invisible force no longer binds me. I did lose a part of me. I lost a weakness. These experiences I went through, I've become a new me.
