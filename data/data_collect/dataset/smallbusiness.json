Ask them what they struggle with. You may start to notice patterns of problems across the 10, 50, 100, or more people you\u2019ve spoken to. These are signs that there is a problem you can solve. If the pain is great enough, or the benefit clear enough, they pay you gladly.\n\nAlso don\u2019t underestimate the trades, services businesses, etc. there\u2019s a reason they are always in demand. Although it can seem crowded, you can easily standout in smart ways.\n\nGood luck my guy. You will do great things. Happy to help if you want to shoot me a dm, I\u2019m part of a community of service businesses that help one another to grow"}, {"comment_author": "hierosir", "comment_text": "There's a lot here. And some terms need to be defined before we can answer. Firstly - what do you mean by wanting \"more freedom?\"\n\nDo you want more spare time? Or do you to have more authority over your life? \n\nIf it's spare time, it's likely not through a small business (though not impossible. You could choose to have a \"lifestyle business\", meaning you make choices to give time, not economic reward.)\n\nIf it's more self actualization - yes, a business is a good way to go. \n\nNow, what business? My advice would be to not think about \"what's the best business for money?\" At least not as your first axiom.\n\nInstead think about \"what problem am I most interested/capable to solve for others?\"\n\nThink of that first. And then think about \"how can I make solving this problem most economically viable?\" (That's where you think about business model.) Eg. You could choose to help people with removing garbage. Garbage is the problem you're solving. You could choose to solve that by running around with a bag and pick it up by hand - charged per hour. OR you could give people big bins where they deposit it themselves on premise, and you come around with a truck to collect it weekly/monthly, for a recurring fee.\n\nThe latter is likely a better business model to solve the same problem.\n\nAfter you get this far... All businesses need some fundamental skills. 1. Marketing, 2. Sales, 3. Fulfillment, 4. Operations.\n\nWithin each bucket there's lots of sub skills.\n\nMarketing: building a website, copywriting, running ads, email automations, SMS marketing, buyer intent/journeys, etc.\n\nSales: sales cycle design, B2B sales, b2c sales, objection handling, tonality, sales team management, sales talent hiring, etc.\n\nFulfillment: customer journey design, workflow automations, etc.\n\nOperations: IT, HR, Legal, Payroll, Tax etc.\n\nLearn these peacemeal as your business requires. YouTube & Google are your friend. At first when you have no money to hire people to do the above FOR YOU, youll have to do it yourself.

The fact that this idea is even in your head makes me think you have a lot more learning before you are ready. Malls are a dying business model. They are closing all over the country.

This creates the potential for market saturation and also creates the potential for you to fuck up majorly and choose a poor location. UPS stores are not what they once were. With shipping software becoming more mainstream day by day, youre entering a market where you are needed less and less. As old people die off, your customer base dwindles. The younger generations are printing their own postage at home more and more.\u00a0 Looking at the stats, it appears that as much as 60% of the UPS store locations break even or worse.

At the time, it  was addressed with firm warning, a repayment schedule, and very clear instructions from me and our other partner that this was not okay, and that all further expenses be preauthorized or paid by him personally and then submitted for reimbursement. \n\nI don't know what to do as he's now refusing to own up to this behavior as he seems to think it would be an admission of guilt which we could then use against him, despite us having video/audio recordings, slack conversations and the books that already clearly demonstrate the truth.\n\nThe business is growing like mad, is very profitable, and he has been instrumental in building it, despite a laundry list of quarterly colossal fuck ups. He is also, by and large, the face of the company and has all but promised mutually assured destruction if taken to court. \n\nMy current request is that he own it, commit to a repayment schedule, and since this is a repeat offence, I want him to relinquish majority decision making to either all three of us by vote, or just my allow my other partner to serve as president/ceo for the foreseeable future.\n\nAny advice or feedback from this sub would be greatly welcome here.

I\u2019m a one person business too, and make jewelry also (totally different tho, assembly jewelry and lower prices that yours (altho my prices are higher than my competition, i still sell well cause of unique design, good branding and excellent photos). Been in business for over 17yrs now, 15yrs full-time.\n\nWhen i started, there was soooo much less stuff to do. Like photos had to be ok, and that was enough to sell. No videos was the absolute norm. SEO wasn\u2019t a thing on etsy, and it barely was a thing in general. Social media was\u2026 well twitter or facebook, that\u2019s all there was. Basically, there was so much less to do to be \u201cselling appropriate\u201d, and so much less competition as well. \n\nI learned and learned and learned (only thing j outsource is yearly taxes). And at some point in 2017-2018 i hit a wall. I just couldn\u2019t do more anymore, i didnt wanna learn a new goddamn thing again, i\u2019d had enough. I also didn\u2019t wanna outsource because of 1- funds and 2- altho i accept some outside pov, honestly, no one knows my products, and my buyers, more than me. No one can write an instagram post that sounds like me\u2026\n\nSo, i realized my only option was cutting out stuff. And that started with social media. The hours i was putting into instagram did bring *some* sales in, but it was NOT proportional to the time i invested, like at all. Same for Pinterest or Facebook. So, these were put on the backburner (aka a post here and there that i would cross-post, but i stopped putting myself pressure to keep a tight schedule, to keep pushing this at all cost. It became \u201cif feel like it so i\u2019ll do it, and if not i won\u2019t.\u201d That gave me back literally HOURS to\u2026 STOP AND REST. Which in turn made me more productive when i did work, cause i wasn\u2019t burned-out-and-panicked. ;)\n\nIn comparison, the time i invested in overhauling my etsy SEO had clear direct positive impacts on sales, so I decided that this was a thing i\u2019d keep some focus on. It was also clear that the time i invested in photos were crucial to my sales, so that stayed. A good chunk of my business is consignent locally in over 10stores, and those sales are stable and work well, and diversifies the eggs in my basket, so that stayed. \u2026\u2026. However, the time i spent trying to figure out Google SEO wasn\u2019t working much, cause let\u2019s get real, as a canadian wanting to reach US customers thru google, it\u2019s nearly impossible as a small business, since google knows i\u2019m in canada and so they show me to canadians (which is fine, but we\u2019re like less people than California alone, that ain\u2019t gonna cut it lol) So, you guessed it, i put that on the backburner again. Sometimes i work on it if i feel like it when i list something new, and if now, oh well, later perhaps.\n\nAlllll that to say (sorry for the novel lol), you don\u2019t have the income to hire out really, so your option is cutting out stuff. From your post, i\u2019d say \u201cstop trying to go viral\u201d. It\u2019s 1- a lot of time to do reels and all that and 2- everyone wants to go viral on there, but most never do. That\u2019s just real life facts. \u201cGoing viral\u201d is not a realistic solution to more sales, so, drop it. \n\nJust an extra thought, YOU NEED TO REST. I know it sounds impossible, but i promise you, down time is essential if you\u2019re in this for the long haul. Find the schedule that works for YOU! If what you need is one whole day, then do that. If it\u2019s something else, do that. (For example, it took me a while to figure out what worked best for me, but now it\u2019s: i work 7 days, but i take most mornings off. That\u2019s what works for me since afternoons are my productive time, and this way i can enjoy my mornings off without guilt cause i know later i\u2019ll be working. So yeah, it\u2019s 7 days, but it\u2019s not all day every day. I\u2019ve also had my best year yet last year, and ive never worked less before\u2026 i\u2019m a machine in the afternoons cause im so rested haha it\u2019s like i do things so effectively that it compensates the lower hours, it\u2019s crazy!)\n\nAlright, i\u2019m stopping now.

This can be done by a monthly email newsletter sent out, discounts for referrals and maybe discounts for an order with multiple items. Give a discount when they sign up for your newsletter and send a discount code in each email. Market to your demographic through Google. Have someone do this for you as your talents resides in making the pieces. \n\nI am also in a very niches business and use the tactics above and it works.

How much does a ring typically sell for? \n\n  \nJust off the bat you're only doing commissions, which means your marketing strategy will need to be different. \n\n  \nYour website is good, your domain name isn't ideal but it's quirky which works for the type of products you sell. \n\n  \nOne major thing you need to do - add information on pricing range, and delivery time on your website. I'm sure that's the first thing that pops on to people's mind for 90% of the people interested. Not having that information means an extra step in the buying process - people need to email you to find that out, and then decide if they want to buy. Most people won't bother to send the email, and then when you do reply a lot will have forgotten why/what they wanted to buy. Frictionless is key to online selling - think Amazon and their one page checkout. A lot of purchases are 'impulse' purchases too, you show them why they want something and they buy it. \n\n  \nI'm in your target market - late 20s male, living in a major city (London). I would buy one of these if more information was presented. \n\n  \nHonestly in terms of marketing I don't think there's a lot you need to do. Your type of product means stuff like SEO, PPC, Affiliate marketing etc are not needed. You basically need to create 5 or so strong social media ads, target them very well to the right demographics, and not worry anymore. If you're not great with advertising, pay someone $500-$1000 to set it up, and maybe like a $200 monthly retainer to optimise it for you.
