This sums it up: I created the account because I needed to start taking payments asap, I got my account created and I could not log in to OB no matter what I did. They \"look into it\" two weeks go by and I finally get frustrated, call in a demand to speak to a manager and get thus resolved so I can take payments and not frickin venmos, after an hour they  realize the guy who created my account mis entered on the digits on my EIN and I basically had to go back in a set up everything again from scratch. A plethora of misinformation about interest rates, balance transfers, and promotional deals I told I was getting, and every single person told me conflicting things. Then I did a balance transfer because i was specifically told it was 0% interest. I had to make a call at the bank to do it where I was then told it was 21% interest. I immediately canceled the next morning at 9. They told me the cancel was successful and it would not go through. Then, a week or so later, I see the amount of the balance transfer on my credit card. I call in to see why it's on there. Several calls were made, and they told me it was cancelled and that it would fall off the balance. A week or so later, it's still there so I call in for like the 50th time for various issues. The lady on the phone admitted to me that whoever canceled it made a mistake and didn't do it properly, so it went through. I told her about how I was told it was 0% interest and that the reason I cancelled it was the hugh interest rate. She Saud they would call me and let me know if they could change the interest rate to 0. Two weeks go buy, and I finally hear from dispute resolution. They said, \"we have investigated this incident and found that we were not in error, so the interest rate would not change.\" I was furious. The lady literally told me they made a mistake. I paid the bill in full to avoid interest instead of using that towards an item for my business.\n\n I could go on there are a few more things, but long story: avoid PNC at all costs", "reply_created_utc": 1714503002.0}, {"index": "red3_s8_c46_", "comment_text": "My buddy and I started our company and went with grasshopper and it\u2019s taking 6 business days  to deposit 5k into our acct.
