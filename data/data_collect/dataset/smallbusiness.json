I never questioned it because her business as 3x my salary in the first year and kept growing.  I developed the mentality of \u201cwhenever people are throwing money at your feet, bend down and pick it up\u201d.  Just my way of saying if you hit upon something, just focus and work your ass off to maximize that thing as much as possible. \n\nNow we\u2019re functionally retired and  the business brings in about 2 mid-career tech salaries without us having to do more than a few hours work every month.  We figured out how to grow our team to run operations at a steady state and just make solid money.  Oddly, income/profits are up this year by 60% in the first 3 months so definitely something is going right.\n\nNote: education business & no, I won\u2019t tell any more details.

And then think about \"how can I make solving this problem most economically viable?\" (That's where you think about business model.) Eg. You could choose to help people with removing garbage. Garbage is the problem you're solving. You could choose to solve that by running around with a bag and pick it up by hand - charged per hour.

I own a tutoring business, and my hours of operation are typically after school (3 pm\u20148 pm) and weekends (10 am\u20146 pm). I have two office spaces, about 12'x15' each, fully equipped with a printer/scanner, laptops, iPads, a 3D printer, high-speed internet, etc... My lease has terms where I cannot sublease my space, but I could use my office from 8 am - 2 pm to earn additional revenue. I am seeking suggestions to spark inspiration to use the space in the mornings without breaking my lease.\n\n", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "AutoModerator", "comment_text": "This is a friendly reminder that r/smallbusiness is a question and answer subreddit.
