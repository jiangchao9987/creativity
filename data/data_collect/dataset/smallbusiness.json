When we build a website we make sure to first do keyword research and a competitor analysis and then write the content to be as readable as possible with internal linking, correct hierarchy, etc. We also make sure the site is fast, ADA compliant, responsive, bug free, etc. \n\nRanking high in search comes down to many factors but essentially it comes down to having a high quality website, posting regular high quality blog posts, and getting backlinks (links from one site to another) from reputable websites. For example, if the local news used you for a quote and linked your website in their article that would count as a high quality backlink.\n\n  \nFor Google My Business SEO the ranking factors are 80% reviews, 15% maintaining your profile (responding to reviews and posting regular updates) and 5% continuity across the web, so for example, making sure your hours are the same on your Google My Business page as they are on Facebook. \n\nOur $99/mo plan includes a well optimized website but doesn't include any blog posts or off page SEO features. Our $149/mo plan includes monthly blog posts though as well as monthly reports to show it's working. A few months ago a service based business in a big city got the $149/mo plan and they are already ranking in the top 10 for their desired keywords and continue to rank higher and get more traffic month after month. \n\nSorry for the novel of a response but I wanted to make sure I explained everything accurately.

Essentially, I got into the hobby back in January, and I realized that there were no US-based services for replacement parts. So I saw the opportunity and hopped onto it.\n\nI started by stocking up on low-cost kits ($15-30) for the sake of diversity of inventory, selling parts sections (e.g. the head, the left arm, the backpack, etc). This was marginally successful--I started averaging 5 sales a week--but I realized that the big money was going to be in purchasing larger, more expensive kits and selling the parts individually, resulting in larger profit margins and less labor required on my part.\n\nNow I can hardly go a day without a sale. My last weekly eBay payout was $81 and I have the ball rolling to continually expand my inventory without adding to my initial capital investment, while slowly paying myself back for the roughly $800 I initially invested into my inventory. My name is often passed around the internet hobby communities, and I hope to get to a point where I can formally register as a business, get an EIN, and order parts from a proper distributor, and sell full kits as well as replacement parts. My long-term goal is to start a model kit-oriented hobby store, but that's probably a few years down the road."}, {"comment_text": "This post welcomes and is dedicated to:\n\n* Your business successes\n* Small business anecdotes\n* Lessons learned\n* Unfortunate events\n* Unofficial AMAs\n* Links to outstanding educational materials (with explanations and/or an extract of the content)\n\nIn this post, share your small business experience, successes, failures, AMAs, and lessons learned.

I was at a networking event speaking to another local business owner and he said something that stuck with me.

The good ones always had the same traits (and so did the bad!).\n\nI guess the main thing that I took was for me to give back a little more to those local businesses in my area that can use my help and rather than keep the knowledge I have gained, I should be sharing more to help those starting out on their journey. \n\nAnyways!

My parents were having a new roof put on their house while they were on vacation on the other side of the country.  My mom told me to pay them whenever they finished, and just wrote me a check for it.  I deposited the check in my account. Then wrote the check to the roofers.  It was for $20K.  When the audit happened I thought for sure they would give me shit about that. But they accepted my explanation.  You could see the money came in and right back out.\n\nBut there are other things that I do that could be a problem.  Since covid happened I go to the grocery store for my parents.  I Started doing it so they didn't have to go into public.  I just kept doing it to help them out.  I buy whatever they need, then give them a bill at the end of each month. My mom writes me a check for the amount.  I'm afraid they could claim that is income.\n\nBut the most valuable lesson I learned is to have lots of bank accounts.\n\nHave a business account.  Have a personal account.  Have a couple other accounts.

I legit was about ready to show up at a few contractors offices with a bat because it was pretty much the only option left lol.

Suing a business who can\u2019t or wont pay their bills is always a precarious plan, but really the only one you have as a last resort.

", "reply_text": "This is not going to be very comforting, but here we go:\n\nYou and your husband are learning a number of very important business lessons. First, in the company that that went bankrupt, it is unlikely that you'll recover much if anything, maybe pennies on the dollar and you'll need an attorney to even get that.  The company is probably in the very lengthy \"unsecured creditor\" line and the secured creditors get their cut first and unsecured creditors get to fight over the crumbs.\n\nWith respect to the \"other guy\" that is still in business - see if you can arrange a payment plan with them - anything to get the cash flowing again.  Cash flow is the key to small business survival. \n\nWith respect to cutting expenses:  There isn't enough 1-ply toilet paper in the world that will solve your problem.  You can cut expenses to zero, but if there's no revenue, you're in a world of hurt.  Cutting expenses only slows the bleeding, it does not stop it.\n\nWith respect to clients that do not pay or are slow payers; You must get a retainer up front for 50-75% of the job before work will begin.  Large companies may balk at this because they think they have power over you (and they might), but I've consistently taken the stance, \"If they want the goods, they must pay the tariff\" and that has served my company quite well.\n\nIf your business survives, and that is a pretty big \"if\" at this point from the desperation I hear in the post, you've learned that you need both a personal and business cash reserve that you can tap into when the times are slow.  Some small business gurus say 3-6 months of anticipated expenses.  I say two years and that wisdom has proven its worth during the COVID era.\n\nI can also speak from the husband's perspective: Whinging about it is not going to help matters.  I guarantee that Hubster is acutely aware of the problem.  You're in this together and both of you must take emotion and ego out of the solution; which may mean that he has to temporarily close the business and go back to engineering for someone else until you can right the ship and then try again (or permanently close the business and go back to work for someone else).  Closing down and going back to work as a W2 employee is an option that must be on the table.\n\nI wish you the best of luck."}, {"comment_text": "My husband expanded his engineering business 2 years ago to become a full service engineering, architecture and land development Co.

I hardly pay any taxes for my business. But I'm in a write off heavy industry.  I own a cabinet shop.  I've been in the growing phase since I Started it in 2011.  I've bought property, a commercial building, and buy all the new tools and machines I can.  Slowly switching out older machines for high tech new ones.    This is a proven way to build a business.  \n\nFor example.  I just bought a new laser cutter that is getting ready to be delivered.  It was around $30K.  I will depreciate it and write off $6K for five years on my taxes with it.  So I'm not paying income taxes on the money I used to buy it.  I do have to pay property taxes on it, but that also will depreciate.  A write off just lets me not pay income taxes on the money, its not free money.  But I'm building equity into the business.  So its worth more.  \n\nYou need to get a good tax person and figure out what kinda write offs you should be chasing each year.  The ideal business is one that is paying zero taxes.

You need a cashflow forecast. This will help smooth out your 'low lows' and 'high highs'. You/your CPA/bookkeeper need a strong understanding of your business and payment cycles. You should be able to know (within reason) how much cash your business will have 30 days from now. \n\n2.) It doesn't sound like you made quarterly tax payments. Start doing this ASAP. Make sure this gets tracked so at any point in time you know how much you've paid in for the year. \n\n3.) You need to keep your finger on the pulse of your AR. Brainstorm ways to shorten your collection period. Ideally, you would automate this in some form. \n\n4.) Keep your overall tax strategy in mind throughout the entire year. It would be helpful if you had a defined budget outlining any CAPEX you have planned. Using these 2 things together, you'd know if you should 'spend more' or not. \n\nI recommend getting a really good CPA to help you with the steps outlined above. \n\nWords of advice is to keep on going! You're obviously doing something right being able to scale your business to $220k.

I went to the doctor and he gave me painkillers and told me to keep moving/walking and it would get better.\n\nThe person that got me the job and was my mentor, also did sports massage. He released the tension in my muscles and showed me some stretches. It was gone in a week and after 2 weeks I had no pain, just a lot of weakness in some muscles and eventually got better.\n\nSo I was motivates to learn. I took a course and he taught me sports massage and deep tissue. So I did massage + PT at the gym and started to work with him on a company he wanted to start up. We started with massage at workplaces. Went from 1-3 different office deals in a year. Third year we opened up a clinic. \n\nFast foward to this year, Ive been doing sports massage for 5-6 years and he wants to go back to PT. So Im buying the company and everything we built up.

", "reply_text": "Mine came about organically. As a child, I wanted to be a writer when I grew up. Discovered I could actually make a living with computers when I was in high school, so I got a degree in information technology in college. \n\nSince I had to pay for college myself and I hate wasting money, which was still possible in the 90s, I scrambled for every scholarship I could get and spent the $100 per test to test out of as many required classes as I could. This meant I got to stack extra classes into my major for double the required concentrations, including some graduate courses for undergraduate prices. It also left me with enough credits to fill that I got a minor in literature. \n\nSpent the next decade as a system administrator for a check printing company until I got laid off right before my first child was born. Drove home with no idea how I'd pay my mortgage but thinking that was a lot of stress off my shoulders and I could now go full time with my coaching business that has been a side gig for the past 4 or 5 years. (I coached mostly marathoners, with a few ultra runners and helped with a group coaching of newer runners at the local shoe store as a good source of lead generation for future solo clients.)\n\nPretty much didn't touch that business again, since I was charging 4 times more than anybody else in my area and it wasn't worth the time I gave every client and I resented the time out of the house. (I was a good coach, but there were other coaches that were good that charged a lot less. Funny thing is that I gave up the one way that I made money from my running but added on a ton of volunteer activities where I didn't such as club committees, board of directors for a national non-profit, and organizing 14-20 road and trail races every year...)\n\nInstead, I started a publishing company. Started with a book I'd woken up two nights before the lay off thinking about, then working with a runner friend to publish some books about his dog for him. I was a perfectionist and there weren't good formatting tools then like there are now, so I built one for myself that turned 18 hours of work into about 2 hours per book. I then partnered with a couple guys to finance development of my software into something commercial, which they hired my brother for who had just graduated from college, and then they hired me to use that software to format their books for them. I took over all of their publishing, plus did a little web administration for them. \n\nFast forward a few years, one of those gents sold his share of the business, and the other had been trying to hire me full time that entire time, so I took on some more responsibility as we were moving to a new house and having a second kid and the cash flow would be nice. One of my new responsibilities was managing a membership site teaching people how to self publish that I'd helped them set up a couple years prior. \n\nFast forward 4 years and we hired my wife to do customer service, and slowly but surely the two of us were the have of that branch of the business. A couple years ago we bought a few of the brands off our boss, including the software tools we'd continued to develop over the years. \n\nSo, basically, I randomly fell into a career where I spend all day talking to people about books or developing cool software to help people write and sell their books. Which makes me amongst the minority of people I know and grew up with that are actually using their college degrees at this stage of our life.\n\n(Fun fact: I don't think they actually copied us and had most likely independently created a similar tool, but the original version of Kindle Create by Amazon was almost a complete clone of our initial tool my brother developed for me about a dozen years ago. Both tools have gone in different directions and don't resemble each other at all now, though.)"}, {"comment_text": "People who own businesses, how did you find out what you wanted to do? was it set from the start or did it take you a while to figure it out? \n\ni\u2019m struggling to even have an idea of what to start, i just know i want a buisness.
