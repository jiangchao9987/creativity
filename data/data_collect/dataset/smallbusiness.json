So if that business owner paid $5,000 for a herman miller office chair. They would subtract $5k from their $100k income. And then they would be taxed 30% on 95k instead.

Ultimately, business loans have to be secured by capital or personal guarantee (if you have enough assets to cover it).

I do bi-weekly drops of curated items. There is a high demand and people often ask me to reserve things for them. As I want to keep things fair and want to give everyone the same chance, I almost never do this and just let first come, first serve count. However, I recently did a favor to one of my customers (whom I regularly positively interact with on my brandpage and who gives me a lot of positive feedback) where I let them know in advance that an item I know they'd like was coming up (from previous shopping experience) after they had asked me if I would be able to help them out since they were unlucky a lot of times with getting their hands on items and I really wanted to help them out. Even though I am not a person to care at all about status, this person is a known football player and it puts me in a bit of a difficult spot. Last week I happened to be at one of the matches of their team and I let my customer know that I'd be there. They then let me know that we could do the handover of the item after the match, since this customer lives overseas and their team would play in my city - it would save a lot of shipping and hassle. I knew that this might not be the most ideal as I understand things could get very busy after the match, so 2 days beforehand I asked for reassurance if I should still bring the sweater, yes or no. I then got asked if yes, I could please bring the sweater. It's the day of the match and I didn't hear or see anything and waited for 1,5 hours after the match without any replies to my message or any updates -- and since they are \"famous\", there was no way for me of reaching them. Even though I understand that a lot would be going on after the match, I personally felt a bit disrespected both professionally and personally as I had asked for confirmation 2 days prior and got asked to 'please' bring it. The next morning I still hadn't heard anything. In the afternoon I sent out a text that I felt a bit disrespected as I hadn't heard anything still and that we had an agreement, I then asked if they still wanted to purchase the sweater. At the end of the day I got a reply that yes they still wanted to purchase the sweater and that they didn't have time after the match. It still felt off to me, as it was their idea to do the handover of the sweater after the match even after I asked for reassurance. At that time I said it was all good and asked how they would like to do the payment so I could set the manual order in progress. This was 7 days ago. I haven't heard anything back, but I do see they are online on Instagram. In a few days I have my next drop. The sweater that I have reserved is a sweater with high demand. It would sell out quickly. But I am a bit stuck between what I should do now. I want to offer great customer service, but I am also wondering when it should be enough. Seeing as I want things to be fair for everyone. I also cannot afford any bad reviews from this customer, since they have a large fanbase.\r  \n\r  \nI would like to hear some advice/opinions on when customer service has been offered enough?
