What would enable you the most if you could magic a different sequencer?"}, {"comment_text": "A sequencing question - awesome! I'm pretty excited about long reads and ability for de novo assembly at a reasonable price point. It is still too expensive for a company to scale but getting closer and short read sequencing with Illumina is really good, highly accurate and has been clinically validated. One current challenge with the current sequencers is to make cost efficient you have to run dozens of samples at once so trade-offs between cost and turnaround time to manage. Upstream & downstream constantly being improved.", "reply_text": "Thanks for answering!\n\nWhen you say long reads, can you clarify? Do you need 100kb or would 1-2kb make a difference? Also curious about your point regarding economies of scale. If you could achieve the same cost per Gb without multiplexing, would that make a difference? If you could do it much faster too, would that make you sequence more often?\n\nOne thing I have a hard time to understand is that even if you could achieve the same price per datapoint with a single sample, you may still want to multiplex as it will simplify your loading of the sequencer. If you use robots to prepare 96 samples in a plate, it then becomes a single step to load and run a NovaSeq. But if you could run them separately, then you do the sample extraction and individual loading which may be more work."}, {"comment_text": "Thanks for answering!\n\nWhen you say long reads, can you clarify?

I am not as up to date on technology as I was when at a research institution and we evaluated all new sequencers but my guess is 5-10kb is plenty to eliminate amplification bias and improve assembly. \n\nThe toughest part of building a genomics service is the quantity of samples required to achieve the lowest cost/Gb. I think Novaseq X is \\~120 samples per 48 hours now so either need \\~1800 samples per month or sacrifice reagent cost or turnaround time - depreciation, which is usually excluded from Cost/Gb calculations, is also a major component of cost when a sequencer costs $1M and has a useful life under three years. \n\nI think there are also some quality control benefits to multiplexing in addition to automating the library prep. Library prep is pretty quick for genomes so try to optimize prep+loading strategies as much as possible."}, {"comment_text": "Answer here is a little beyond Fore but an area I'm familiar with having been at labs in the past.

I also emailed every hotel, restaurant, pub, hospital, university etc, in Dublin. \n\nI spent approx 100 hours on getting everything set up. Getting the email addresses for all of the targeted businesses was the grind. \n\nThe money was soon rolling in and I was spending about \u20ac500 a week on paid ads. I had no idea where the signups were coming from (paid ads, or the emails), so I just decided to saturate both with my referral code.

I asked if there were any restrictions on sign ups or pay outs, and they said\u2026 \u201cno, keep doing whatever you\u2019re doing\u201d.\n\nI knew they would eventually realise, probably by seeing my ads themselves.

So my taxi business has been booming ever since. \n\nAlthough I made \u20ac120k, Mytaxi paid out \u20ac240k when you include the \u20ac10 discount they covered for each customer.\n\nIt mightn\u2019t be the typical story you see here, but just wanted to share, and show how you can stumble into something extremely lucrative by keeping your eyes open.

What I would change:\n\n* Click on features link to your youtube explainer, but there's no textual information here to work off with. Just a video that has no voiceover, no explanation. \n* I would add a simple table (two-column layout) comparing the free usage vs the paid tier. Do I get 3 idea validated per day with the free tier? What about caps or limits? Do I get the email functionality? \n* No screenshots? For a SaaS like yours to stand out against the competition, this is something that will validate the user's (no pun intended) assumption about feature sets when comparing across products vs. just using something like Trello / JAM-stack to put up a simple sign up page.\n\nI hope I don't come across as harsh. I'm also a software entrepreneur so I know how lonely and frustrating this can be. My first software went on for 11 months before I got my first paid sign-up. I sold it in 2016 to get some cash out, and went into a different vertical (data science and analytics).

Talking to people and the target. Starting with a niche, understanding that niche, creating a prototype/MVP with a main feature that focuses on the specific need of the target customer.

This part isn't always easy because most people don't answer you, so it's important to be creative in creating a mechanism for collecting feedback. Lots of research! Understand the current players etc. I suggest you have a plan, a plan means you don't do things randomly but do things to measure specific results.
