To get clear on the value you offer to the market-place, a good first step is to draw your attention to two things: (a) any times you felt you were in flow and making a valuable contribution, and (b) any times you were told -- by employer or colleagues -- that you were making a valuable contribution\n6.

", "post_comments": [{"comment_author": "HelloBello30", "comment_text": "How I did it is a really long story and some of it is not possible to replicate. Sometimes, the details aren't relevant because they can be discouraging. \"ah, you did this thing, which is not possible to me, therefore I am out of luck\". I do not want to convey that sort of sentiment, so I will give some general principles. It can take 10 - 15 years and it's not easy.\n\n1. First, you shouldn't necessarily jump straight into the mentality of becoming rich. It's possible to go straight from poor to rich, but it's far more rare than becoming poor to middle class to rich. Your goal should be financial stability.\n2. Pursue financial stability at all costs. Basically, you need a career that can pay your basic bills, rent, and doesn't eat all your hours. This may involve a trade or a formal education. This isn't glamorous. It shouldn't be something that will consume your life.  There are a lot of such paths.\n3. Invest (even go into debt) in a method to get more disposable income. I converted my basement to a basement apartment. Someone paid me rent and this didn't take more time. Invest any new disposable income into a business. This can be some side hustle that you can do that doesn't consume you.\n4. Now you have a sufficient amount of disposable income to start poking around in online ventures while you continue to work. I say online because online stuff is easier to manage while you simultaneously have  'normal career\". I understand this is extremely broad.\n5. Keep at your online hustles for a long time. It should be big enough for it to safely replace your career before you consider quitting your career. You will be working 2 full time 'jobs' for years and this is exhausting.\n6. Your business has demonstrated growth. Continue growing it. Take all of the profit and re-invest in your business or into a variety of standard investments (real estate, stocks, whatever). Mix it up. Your investments should be high risk, high reward (but calculated, nothing that like gambling). You are doing this with extra profits and therefore this shouldn't break you. You still can't afford luxury. Is there some luck involved at this stage? yes, but that's why you are continuing to invest in different high reward avenues. There is constant research here. Constant networking. Constant exploration of opportunities.\n7. After a few years of #6, you will be a millionaire. High risk stuff doesn't mean low chance. Some of it will work. This seems like a large broad jump, but really, with a career and business for that long, you were only a few 100k off from being a \"millionaire\" anyway. Not that big a leap. At this point, you still aren't done. Start converting your investments to more stable (medium and low risk) investments. Pay off debts like mortgages.

The main motivator cannot be money, you\u2019ll be led by it in your decisions and you\u2019ll end up making a mistake. Morgan freeman said and I quote \u201cmoney is just a side effect\u201d, when you\u2019re passionate and really motivated to do something, you\u2019ll be so focused on the vision and not on measly dollars you can make on this or that deal. You\u2019ll be leading all of your decisions, even if they might be costly, to the greater goal.\n\n\nSo, to resume, you need to go to school, preferably a really good one so I recommend you get your grades up if you haven\u2019t and try to get a scholarship at an Ivy League school; not completely for the education but for the highly motivated and usually wealthy people you will meet there. These people will be your key to success if you aren\u2019t already in that environment. Rich people hang out with rich people, that\u2019s part of the reason they stay rich. They are ahead of most competition by having access to information and resources to make things happen. You NEED to be placed in that environment and only way to do that as a young adult is by either going to a top university or hanging out in those young rich adults groups.\n\nAfter you finished your studies in whatever industry you like, you\u2019ll start working in said industry and specializing yourself, once you understand what you\u2019re good at, you sharpen your skills and try a few different jobs to get an understanding of the industry you\u2019re in. Once you are ready, take a few good acquaintances that are smarter than you in some areas and as ambitious but be careful not to pick someone you\u2019ll have a cock fight with\u2026 that\u2019s dangerous for business.\n\nThe idea of a good school is that once you wanna start your business, you\u2019ll have high credibility to find investors that will trust you thanks to your degree because most of the guys that have money are either 40+ (old school) or banks\u2026 also old school and they see security in someone that graduated from a great school and has a good professional track record. They would be hesitant in investing into someone that hasn\u2019t had a good education.\n\nI know this is probable not what you want to hear because it\u2019s a slow process, the money will be made through a long and hard process of learning, failing and trying again. There is no quick way of making money without taking enormous risks. You can take that road if you want but you better be damn sure about what you\u2019re doing.\n\nBest of luck"}, {"comment_author": "MoveOverBieber", "comment_text": "What's your definition of a \"millionaire\"?

What you do needs to provide real value, so avoid drop shipping, social media adv/marketing, logo design, seo, anything that people can do on a computer for themselves.

Job let me keep growing the real-estate portfolio and made it easy to borrow. Used the two together to grow well past 7 figures by the time I was 30.\n\nUpper-ish middle class background. Parents came from a very middle class family and my dad worked his way up. Because of this I was able to attend private middle and high school and mom was stay-at-home. \n\nI spent most of my childhood messing around with computers. By the time I was in high school I could set up a Win 3.11 network and connect the systems to a file server, so my school hired me and a couple of friends over the summer to set up the school's labs. That led to a ton of \"hire me to set up my computer at home\" kind of gigs as a teenager.\n\nI used to joke with my friends to \"not let school get in the way of your education\" so spent a lot of time just educating myself about things that seemed useful and interesting which for me was strangely Linux, Windows NT and IT security. Straight out of high school I found a job in IT making about 40k (this was 1998) and then used the opportunity to educate myself as fast as possible with tech certifications and developing my soft skills. My salary grew to around 95k over the next few years. This was partly during the dotcom boom which was a strange time in tech and frankly I was making more than I probably should have for someone my age.\n\nI got really good at working with people so at 25 I quit my IT job and started an IT consulting business. My dad gave me nothing except insight on how to network with people, but I acknowledge that the opportunities I had as a kid were crucial to knowing what to do when I started my own business. But I was also stupid and overconfident and lucky too. Within a few months I had replaced my salary and was only going up. \n\nAs my own firm grew, I was able to leverage my increasing income to keep investing in larger real estate projects including apartment buildings in crappy parts of the city. I spent a heck of a lot of my evenings and weekends painting walls and fixing toilets in my shitty apartments. There was a real estate crash around 2008 and I was positioned to buy more.  \n\nLet me tell you that along the way of this path I second guessed myself often and never felt like I'd figured out anything secret whatsoever. I had to - at times - wade through literal shit and even had to get police help to evict druggies from my apartment once. My friends and family thought I was crazy. \n\nDuring all this time, I was reading constantly (some popular stuff like \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" but also about day trading, finance, entrepreneurship, learning how to do sales, how to manage people, etc) and also seeking advice from other more successful people around me. \n\nA secret that many teens don't understand is that successful business people actually love to talk with teens and share their stories. Too many teens are afraid to pick up the phone or send that email and ask for a meeting even after I tell them this. Steve Jobs has this story where he dialed up the co-founder of HP (Bill Hewlett?) and asked for some computer parts - and that landed him an internship! But don't try to call Tim Cook or Satya Nadella. Figure out who owns that local restaurant chain or local house building company or some other local business guy. You might be surprised that these dudes are often millionaires too. \n\nIf I were to try to make a useful set of suggestions for someone who's a teen today, I'm not sure if my advice would apply. Houses are too expensive, I'm not sure if the FHA 3% down program still applies to quadplexes, IT jobs have a higher bar for entry and they are crowded. Getting to 6 figures in your 20's is probably a lot harder now unless you get lucky with a business idea or aim for a professional field. \n\n1) Pick hobbies and spend your time doing something that will have a future. Building leadership skills, technical skills, sales, problem-solving skills, finance/accounting understanding, developing entrepreneurial projects and trying/failing/trying/failing/trying/failing in a loop until you figure out what the factors of a working business model are.\n\n2) Choose your friends wisely. Hang with the ones who challenge you related to #1 above and don't mind a bit of competition. If the idea of them being more successful than you is a bit scary to you, maybe that's a good start\n\n3) live like a miser in your 20s/30s but maximize your income. DO. NOT. BORROW. MONEY. except for appreciating/income-producing assets. Credit card debt just slows you down. \n\n\nAlso, if some new internet money tech comes along and you can buy thousands of pieces of it for like 20 cents each, DON'T SELL IT WHEN IT GROWS TO BE $2/piece.

He initially reached out for the development of his SaaS product. His existing business was targeting \"local businesses\", for marketing services. And his SaaS was like a marketing tool for local businesses (in US).   \n\n\nThese were very early days of GenAI, so he tried automating part of his job with a Chrome extension, which he could sell to his customers. Since he had been working in the industry for a long time, he knew all the pain points of the customers well enough. For us, as the vendor, it was like just another project. A customer came to us with his requirements. And we just built and launched a functioning product for them.   \n\n\nAfter launch, the product blew up. It got a lot of attention and we saw 5000 downloads on Chrome Web Store after a couple months. (Currently it's sitting at 10k downloads)  \n\n\nThat product alone was so successful that the client then came to us for the development of more of his product ideas, and we started shipping those as well. I never asked the client about how the first product got successful and what's the \"scale\" of that success.   \n\n\nA few months later, I had a call with him and he told me that the Chrome Extension SaaS we built for him helped him 3x his primary business's revenue. How? By upselling his local marketing services to the users of that extension.  \n\n\nThis really blew my mind. He built a SaaS product, just as a lead magnet, and even that lead magnet was generating revenue. And then he was able to upsell his more expensive services to those users.   \n\n\nAbsolutely brilliant.  \n\n\nLessons:  \nInstead of thinking about random ideas to work on, work on what you already have expertise in. SaaS and AI are a huge trend right now. Build a small product and start marketing it. Your goal should be to upsell your more expensive services, instead of just selling subscriptions.  \n\n\n&#x200B;", "post_comments": []}, {"post_title": "For those who transitioned back or into the corporate World..

The amount of time, effort and resources required to make it successful compared to the timelines and money you say you have available.\n\nHere\u2019s a few additional thoughts to consider:\nA fashion brand requires testing designs, sampling different kinds of fabric, finding a manufacturer, etc, and it also does not become a brand until it\u2019s well known. A different, yet more affordable approach could be\n1. Create a design in Canva (free)\n2. Set up a Shopify site ($1 first month)\n3. Upload the design to Printful and connect it to your site\n4. Order a shirt for yourself (about $20) and make videos talking about it or wearing it\n5. Upload videos to TokTok\n6. Add item to TikTok shop\n7. Promote on IG and TikTok every day\n8. Increase reach by getting friends and family to buy from you (or give them a shirt in exchange for them making a video)\n9. Rinse and repeat with new designs\n\nThis is an overly simplified overview. However, you can learn the steps required. You can also add paid marketing, though that should either wait until you have a few sales or you need to limit your budget to $200-$300, with about $20 per day, for testing so you don\u2019t burn through your savings.\n\nTo start a salon is not within your budget as that requires a lease, equipment, hair products, and a number of other things. If you know how to do hair you may be able to rent a space within a salon, but unless you know how to get your own clients it can quickly cost more than what you make. Even if the salon brings you clients, expect a slow start as the clients don\u2019t know you yet, so you\u2019ll still need to find your own.\n\nIf your skills are in marketing, organizing, and/or management, and you have friends that are stylists, you could always ask if they want to open up something together with you and share the cost. Then together you can be creative in how you get set up, market yourselves, etc.\n\nIf you want a completely different suggestion, add to your revenue by for example cleaning peoples houses. Depending on where you live, one house could give you $250, and if you use their supplies it\u2019s essentially free to start. You can always hire people as the business grows.\n\nBottom line is that there are options even with limited cash on hand. You just have to be smart about where you spend your time and money."}, {"comment_author": "jabyredd", "comment_text": "Thank you for your optimism and detail.

To make a t-shirt that will sell you need a supplier (most minimum shirt orders would cost most your start up money), then you have to find people that like your shirt enough to pay $50 for it so you can make a profit. I wouldnt buy a $50 shirt anywhere but a known business like nike. Whereas hair styling is a service EVERYONE needs. Unless your bald, you use a hair stylist of some sort.
