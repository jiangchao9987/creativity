Just ignore it and plow forward and after a while the new business will be in your comfort zone and your inner voice will start bitching about something else in your life. It's about confidence and right now you don't have any so the task at hand is to get some by working at it. Search on inner voice.

I wanted to be a Tyrannosaurus rex more than anything in the world. I made my arms short and I roamed the backyard, and I chased the neighborhood cats, and I growled and I roared. Everybody knew me and was afraid of me. And then one day, my dad said, \"Bobby, you're 17. It's time to throw childish things aside.\" And I said, \"Okay, Pop.\" But he didn't really say that, he said, \"Stop being a fucking dinosaur and get a job.\" \n\nBut, you know, I thought to myself, \"I'll go to medical school...l'll practice for a little while, and then I'll come back to it. But I forgot how to do it. Hey, I lost it. \n\nThe point is\u2026don\u2019t lose your dinosaur.", "Haha I needed this. Thank you", "Started a product line. Now have a farm of 3d printers that I tend to mornings and evenings in a spare bedroom.", "Out of curiosity, have you considered having your \"thing\" properly manufactured? \n\nI keep hearing folks talk about selling things with their 3D printers but I can't help but wonder if they couldn't produce a far higher quality product for far less using a real manufacturer with volume discounts.\n\nUnless it's a highly customized thing for every customer, I just don't see why you wouldn't.", "Do you sell direct to consumer with that? That sounds really interesting.", "I hear that 3d printer farms is really saturated right now. Do you want to share more on what you do and how you've made it?", "I posted to another commenter a bit above.\n\nYes, I have. My issue right now is I have over 100 unique listings, each with anywhere from 1 to 40 variants in design, plus every one of those could be 1 of 20 colors.  My volume comes from variety of parts. I'm sure I could get them molded, but... is it worth it?\n\nExample. One of my products take 2 hours and about 1$ in material and I sell for 20$. I sell maybe 10 of these a week?  How long would it take to recover injection mold costs?  (Asking if anyone knows, lol, I dont...)  for me, I just say I'd rather scale up using what I know, (printing) until it's burdensome to do so...\n\nI do consider my products high quality,  as I said in the post to another commenter.  I'm a parts manufacturer who happens to use 3d printing. I am not a 3d printer.\n\nFor my less popular products, it's a no Brainer, printing allows me to iterate on the fly with design improvements,  and offer unique items that no one else does!\n\nPlus, even though this is a buisness... I love having a manufacturing floor in my house, wouldn't be the same outsourcing it. Maybe that's the future for me, but for now, it stays here.\n\nHope that answers! Let me know if you have other questions.", "Yep. Etsy, Amazon, my own storefront. No craft shows, given I work full time, 8 hours out of my Saturday does not sound fun. But packing orders around kids nap times is doable.", "Sure. I've been printing personally for 8 years now. Started commercially about 2ish ago. Started with prusa and ended up with a bambu farm. Despite running a print farm, the key is that, I am not a 3d printer, I am a manufacturer that happens to make products using 3d printing.\n\nBambu lab printers made it easy for anyone to print. So that barrier to entry is even lower now. Used to be that diagnosing print and printer problems set you apart. Now anyone can download a model, hit print, and slap some photos online. And with folks racing to the bottom, it's rough.  No idea how people sell an item with free shipping for 6$ that is made to order. *shrug*\n\nI design 100% of my models. This Is the second barrier to entry. Having a design engineer background in automation helps here! In the niches I am in, I have products that everyone else has, but I also have really unique items that only I have.  This keeps copycats at bay for a bit. I set myself apart by innovating. I also utilize multi materials, hardware and heat inserts on the simple side, acrylic, magnets, corkboard and other on some of our other products. Most people just wanna print and be done. I stock other inventory to manufacture my stuff\n\n3rd barrier to entey... I'm working in cornering the market, everyone and their dogs are on etsy, much fewer are on amazon.  So... I make sure I'm on amazon. Amazon is much harder to list on. Etsy accepts anyone with a pulse and terrible listings. Amazon is a steep learning curve. Shopify is even harder, (still working on this one, no idea how to drive traffic)\n\n\nI enjoy what I do.  Buying over 1500$ dollar in material and receiving it  over 30 packages. Telling my wife to expect to sign for a new printer, but not knowing hot to tell here's there's actually 2 arriving. Implementing inventory processes to track popular color usage. Designing new parts in a notebook while on a plane. Thinking about how to make my hero photos similer so it looks like a cohesive brand. Taking over a second bedroom because no one realized that fulfillment was actually more work than the printing itself. Repairing down printers to keep the farm up during rushes. Working with businesses to design cutom products for their needs. Realizing you ran out of alcohol for the printers and dash to cvs at 10pm.\n\nI love what I do.\n\nAny specific questions?", "Okay, that makes sense. With so many variations it's probably best to stay in-house.\n\nIf you have extremely common purchases (like your 10 a week one) it might make sense to look into outside options and get like 500 made at a time, but yes, it would come down to mold cost and ultimate savings vs doing it yourself. I can't imagine the costs are that high but I also haven't done it personally.\n\nI know there are tons of board game companies making tons of minis and if the cost per mold was insane they'd never make a dime, but I really don't know. One such company is called Panda manufacturing (or something like that). Americans who started a China based board game manufacturer.

You can't just ask ChatGPT to audit your books and tell you it's better to lose money this year writing-off $250m worth of debt on planes your company owns because new laws are coming in that will prevent you from doing it next year. Or something.\n\nThen you kind of move into \"Management Consulting\" which the big 4 also do, and which encapsulates the above but also looks at both internal leadership challenges (why do all our best people keep quitting? Why do Team A and Team B fight all the time?) and also broader strategic direction (should we expand into country A or country B? Should we launch Product A or Product B).\n\nThen you get into technical consulting, and this can range from anything like IT security (this is what I do) to one guy I saw post in this sub once that's a food scientist that helps companies come up with plant-based ice cream recipes. We provide specialised expertise in areas that you don't necessarily have the in-house talent to do yourself, and where it would be next to or impossible to hire someone with our level of experience (or impractical, if you only need them for one month).\n\nAnd so then you get specialised or generalised consultancies that go from one-person-companies like me, all the way up to the big 4.\n\nNow, you ask \"*paying someone to talk about their life experience when they used to work in that field*\"? \n\nNo. Not really. Well, not really at all.\n\nIt's basically like the story of the \"engineer and the hammer\", which has been repeated so many times the exact story and origins have been lost to time, but the gist of it is this:\n\n>A company has a piece of equipment that's not working, they hire this old grizzled engineer to come in... he hits it once with a hammer and sends them a bill for $25,000.  \n>  \n>When they query why they should pay him $25,000 when all he did was hit it once with a hammer, he sends them another invoice that reads \"$5 - hitting machine once with hammer; $24,995 knowing where to hit the machine and that hitting it with a hammer would fix it\"\n\nImagine a single machine holding up an entire factory of people being paid to stand around while profit is being lost every second that widgets aren't being made... and $25k starts to be a pretty low price... and that's value-based consulting.\n\nThe value is not in the telling of a story, it's in applying your expertise to an organisation's problems to generate significant amounts of value for them.\n\nProjects in my space have like a 95% failure rate - they go overtime, under-deliver, etc. The average person makes 1-2k/day in my space, so if there are 5 people on a team and I can deliver the project a week earlier than anybody else then I've already saved them 5-10k.

The challenge that most people have when they\u2019re working on their businesses, is that their businesses become a painful mirror for them. The business inevitably finds a way to bring up everything that they haven\u2019t dealt with and put it in front of their face. And it can be really difficult. I see it all the time with Ayers I work with who have unfinished business from their childhood or earlier relationships, and somehow that business manages to bring the exact thing and put it at their feet.\n\nNow you have two different pieces here. One is your strategic, big picture approach to what you wanna work on in your life. The other is the operational components of your business and making sure that it runs day-to-day from an automation standpoint.\n\nWhat you need to do around your large pictures strategic will dictate what you do around your logistics and operational questions. I think you most likely need to give yourself some time to heal, and work with therapist, and take some of the pressure off. I don\u2019t suggest that you shut your business down, because not having cash flow can make all of the things you\u2019re feeling worse.\n\nAs com suggested, maybe finding someone who can take a percentage of the business, or take the business on while giving you a percentage of it, would be a good place to begin. You don\u2019t have to give up ownership, to have somebody else handling operations and getting profit from your business, because you can have a governing agreement that keeps you as owner, but allows them to operate the business or something similar. These things can easily be drawn up by an attorney and you can find a way to protect both of you. This is the outsourcing route.\n\nThe other option is that you continue to run your business, and do so in a way that deeply sustainable for you, with the majority of your operations, outsourced to people that handle the functions that are not core, and reduce your overall obligation to the business down to the minimum. This is the optimization route.\n\nThe third option is that you can sell the business. You can get a good price for it, specially if you sell it on an online marketplace, and use that cash to give yourself some time to recover and maybe rebuild another business. This is the sale option.\n\nLastly, you could step away from the business entirely and shut it down. It\u2019s always a bit tough when I see entrepreneurs is going through a mental health crisis and know that they\u2019re sitting on a lot of value for themselves to watch someone do that, but at the end of the day, you have to prioritize your mental health. Like I said, I wouldn\u2019t suggest this, but you have to have it as an option so you don\u2019t feel trapped. A lot of times we end up, feeling really trapped by our businesses, and it can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, Etc. Don\u2019t let the business trap you, so keep this option on the table in case you absolutely absolutely feel like you have no other choice. You are not beholden to run the business , unless it serves you. This is the shutdown option.\n\nOK, so we have four options:\n\n- shutdown\n- sale\n- outsource\n- optimize\n\nThese are the four different choices that I can see that are very general, big choices, but they are the choices of general direction for handling the situation. From the strategic standpoint, the part where we operationally handle things.\n\nThe larger issue around depression and detachment, and all of those other things things, is something I need you to understand that many entrepreneurs go through. I run adventures studio, and I work with entrepreneurs all the time. The number of entrepreneurs that suffer from mental illness and difficulties with emotional self regulation, medication, childhood, trauma, and the plethora of other issues that get in the way their businesses is something that is a bitOf an epidemic. It\u2019s not unusual, and in fact it\u2019s often something that seems to be part of what drives people to be entrepreneurs and many cases.

This does not make you not an entrepreneur.\u00a0\n\nThe question that comes up, obviously is a bit personal for public forum, but the real issue is whether or not you\u2019re getting good professional help and dealing with these issues. Because, nobody can handle what you\u2019re going through alone. I know, I\u2019ve dealt with depression in companies I\u2019ve been running. You have to have help.\u00a0\n\nDo you have good help? Do you have a team of people that are helping you to deal with these feelings, in a way that\u2019s healthy, because you\u2019re not gonna get there by meditating and trying to control deep seeded emotional issues that come from very deep inside of you. There needs to be some help for you, and I think as entrepreneurs we often times look for asking for help as a bit of a failure, as if we should be able to do it without fuss and drama. But the truth is that everyone in entrepreneur land is a little bit fucked up and we do need help and support and getting through these times, especially when we\u2019re dealing with things that are deep seated emotional traumas .\u00a0\n\nThe largest strategic question of what you want to do with your life in your career, is obviously going to be taking it backseat to the fact that you feel desperately out of control and scared and fearful about losing your company, and also about being out of control with depression and anxiety.\n\nOK, so I know I\u2019m being quite for both, and I\u2019m dictating all of this on my phone because it\u2019s far more than I could write, and I\u2019m not near a laptop, but I want to to know that you hear that there are entrepreneurs out here that have done And dealt with exactly the kind of stuff that you\u2019re dealing with, and that you\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s OK. It\u2019s going to be OK too. You\u2019re going to turn out OK from this.\u00a0\n\nSo, do you have help to deal with this situation, because I really don\u2019t want to find out that you\u2019re trying to control this incredible intensity of emotional upwelling with meditation and relaxation techniques or whatever. You need a bona fide therapist, who can help you to process the trauma that\u2019s obviously coming up.", "Continued\u2026\n\nYou know, one of my mentors taught me that all businesses intensely personal, and I know I\u2019ll dox myself to a certain number of people for saying that, but it\u2019s the truth. Everyone of these companies were building is full of lessons for ourselves, and way we can grow and be successful, and we build them not only to challenge ourselves to make money but to challenge ourselves to grow as people. And that\u2019s actually a mentality that\u2019s incredibly important to understand in business. We are expressed in the businesses that we build, and businesses are all about our relationship with ourselves and others. There is no demand from customers, there\u2019s only connection between people, and with a few exceptions of quant businesses, all businesses are relationship. Even market demand is nothing more than customers wanting your product, and by extension wanting you. \u00a0And so if all business is intensely personal, it\u2019s really important that we work on ourselves so that our business reflects ourselves, and that means being loving to ourselves in a way that allows us to grow the business and maintain our best selves in the process.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s incredibly important for you to to take care of yourself, because you owe it to what you\u2019ve built, and to yourself as an extension through your company, and simply to yourself as a human being who deserves love and care just for being here.\n\nOK, so I\u2019ll wrap up this diet tribe with a reassertion of the question about whether or not you\u2019re getting good help? That\u2019s the most important thing, and then let\u2019s talk about the four different options, and see if you have any more that you could add to it, maybe I can help you figure out which of those options makes the most sense for you, and give you some idea of how you can get that done. And I\u2019m sure the other members of this community would be really happy to jump in and help me do so. There are some really amazing people on here.\u00a0\n\nThe most important thing I can tell you is to hang in there. One of the best and most important lessons I ever learned when I was going through hell is to keep going. You\u2019re gonna be OK. Don\u2019t quit, and don\u2019t get scared. You got people here to support you.\n\nAnd again excuse any typos I dictated this because I can\u2019t type all this on my phone and don\u2019t have a laptop available atm.\n\nTalk soon.

It's crucial to find a balance that works for you, where your mental health and business can coexist without one undermining the other.\n\nRemember, your value isn't solely defined by your entrepreneurial success.

This journey comes with its costs and sometimes that can be steep. What\u2019s worth keeping in mind is that in moments of such personal extremis one\u2019s thought processes can become very much black or white, all or nothing orientated which is where it seems you find yourself, currently. From what you write, you are describing symptoms of depression and anxiety, an attenuation of your personal coping resources and resilience. You have these but given the trauma and burnout you refer to, your access to these resources is compromised. It\u2019s an  overwhelm and a bandwidth issue in practical terms in how your function is being affected. As others have suggested, perhaps find someone/people to delegate to whilst you recover. This can help you step back from working within your business and heal whilst working on your business in terms of its direction. Easier said than done, no idea as to the logistics etc but something akin to this approach would help you retain the distance travelled (dude, you did 500k!) which is an incredible achievement. Mental health, as is your physical and emotional health, is critical and you need to heal; celebrate what you\u2019ve achieved even if you have to go through the motions to begin with. Find a therapist if possible, they can ask you the questions that can actually help instead of rehashing the issues from your perspective: why that is important is so that you can be simulated by questions that can draw out different perspectives that you may be overlooking. I know you will be the expert in those issues but you need someone who is able to help you navigate what is clearly a significant challenge in your life. You are not alone by a long chalk. If you can get to where you\u2019re at now (success wise) you have more than enough to get past this clearly, significant challenge. But: You are Not Alone.

If you are seriously demotivated and depressed, you are possibly looking at a serotonin system problem.\n\nFurther to the OP: \nI am not a doctor and none of this is medical advice, but I studied molecular bio. and biochemistry (pre-med) and I am Bipolar man--so I live with chronically recurring mental illness and intellectual disability and have some idea what you are going through.\n\nSome studies show exercise is as effective as some SSRIs for dealing with depression.

Is all that money gone? Do you have enough of it to put into safe, pseudo-liquid investments and live on the interest?\nI agree with everyone here that has said: focus on your health first. There is a saying: \"your health is your wealth\". It is gospel truth. If you are too sick to work regularly, that is how you become a pensioner, or worse, homeless. Mental illness can take a very long time to get to the bottom of, understand, and learn to deal with. So, to handle this situation properly, you will want to stop all excess spending as soon as possible and go into survival mode and try to live as frugally as possible without denying yourself simple pleasures. Fortunately, if you have managed 500K well you are in a good starting position. In survival mode, get professional help. Be honest with your doctors about how you are feeling and be as observant, self-aware and honest with yourself and medical team as possible. I promise you: It can get better. \n\nFigure out how to step back a bit from the business and take care of your health issues. Assuming you don't have a permanent biochemical imbalance like me, properly managing your work life balance and the stresses of your personal life with the business should help you.

If you are in a country that has poor mental Healthcare, you need to leave ASAP. If you are finding it hard to work more than 4 hours a day due to mental health, then you really need to see a professional and a country with bad access to professionals or an even worse stigma surrounding mental health than the USA, then you might need to leave.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with high profit entrepreneurial ambitions, but anyone who has profit as their main reason for living is bound to become depressed. You need to go into \"survival mode\" for a while and take care of your basic needs and figure out why you are feeling the way you are feeling. \n\nIt could be biochemical or it could be situational.
