Plop a cup of soda in a stocking or tissue paper with a couple of holes poked in the top. Pop the little parcel in the box with the invitations and leave for 24hours plus, maybe even a couple days. The soda bomb will absorb the smell. This also works with smelly fridges, musty cupboards, cat pee smell, BO smell (i worked in retail and many stinky armpit people would try on clothes so we use bicarb parcels)\n\nEdit to add: you can even put a couple droplets of essential oils like lavender to give the invites a pleasant scent =)"}, {"comment_text": "Hello, my fiancee and I ordered our wedding invitations from etsy.

Personally, some coworkers shared with me that they put fabric softener sheets between several pages and let it sit for a while and that would take care of a lot of it.

The reason the ants probably flocked to the one trap and why you're still seeing ants after other sprays is due to how ants travel and communicate. They leave sent trails that other ants follow. Two ants scope out an ant hotel, one goes in the other goes back to the others and says hey guys I think we found something, and they all follow the scent trail back to the trap that was initially found. More ants will follow the same scent trails left by other explorer ants.
