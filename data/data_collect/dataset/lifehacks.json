Inside your cabinets, in cracks, under the fridge, behind the sink, near the trash can, anywhere that will be safe from kids and pets. The bait attracts them, they eat it, and die seconds later. When I first used it, less than 5 minutes of putting down the poison, a roach was running circles in the kitchen floor and immediately died. I swept it up and went to bed. I awoke to dozens of dead roaches on my kitchen floor. I swept them up and went to work, only to come home to dozens more. I kept finding dead roaches for the next two weeks. This was 6 years ago.

They are most active 2 to 3 hours after sunset.\n\n\nSome more information \nCockroaches clean themselves regularly.  They also clean their long antennae, which are made up of about a hundred sensor cells, which ensure that the cockroaches can communicate with each other.  The antennae also ensure that cockroaches can orient themselves well even if they cannot see much.\n\n Much of their life and movement is controlled by scent.  Cockroaches have a highly developed sense of smell and taste that ensure that they can find food even in the dark.\n\n Cockroaches are omnivorous and when extremely hungry they even eat others of their own species.  They need very little food to survive.  Crumbs in kitchen cupboards and on counters or leftover food in the dishwasher can be more than enough.  Given the choice, cockroaches prefer sugary foods.\n\n Water is essential for cockroaches, but they don't need a lot of moisture.  They get moisture from their food or drink directly by sucking water from the sink or through condensation on pipes.\n\n Cockroaches belong to the group of the fastest insects.  Some species reach a maximum speed of 130 cm/sec.  On average, a cockroach can travel 1 kilometer per hour.  In addition, cockroaches are excellent climbers.  Thanks to a kind of suction cups on their legs, cockroaches can climb vertically upwards and even walk upside down.\n\n Reproduction\n The reproduction of cockroaches varies per species.  The female emits scents to attract the male.  In general, water and warm temperatures are necessary for reproduction.\n\n During the nymph stage, cockroaches molt 5-7 times.  German cockroaches can produce approximately 7 egg packets in their entire lifetime.  The nymphs can reproduce immediately after the first molt.  The first egg packet is laid about 1 to 2 weeks later.\n\n After the eggs have hatched, development into an adult cockroach begins.  In the male, this phase can last up to 5 months at a temperature of 30\u00b0C, in the female almost 15 months.  During the larval stage, Oriental cockroaches can undergo up to 10 molts.  Oriental cockroaches live an average of 10 months.\n\n The development of the German cockroach from egg to adult cockroach takes at least 2 months.  This period can last up to 7 months at temperatures below 25\u00b0C or in difficult living conditions.  The egg packet (ootheca) of the German cockroach contains an average of 30 eggs and is carried and fed by the female for 2-5 weeks.  During the weeks that the female cockroach carries the egg packet, she limits her activities to a strict minimum.  Before laying the eggs, the female absorbs water to build up enough pressure to expel the egg packet.  The female leaves the egg packet in a random place, just before the nymphs hatch.  \n\nwhich also helps is hoyhoy.  a glue board with an attractant.", "Seconding Advion gel. It was a miracle product that cleared a throughly infested apartment kitchen within a week. I'd only ended up using a single syringe and passed the remaining ones to my neighbors.

The problem with it is you have to leave it out for it to work. There is also a poison you can get from the hardware store called Demon, it is super effective.

People who are this style of talker find it extremely rude to be interrupted.\n\nThe other style is more of a lively free for all, where people interject enthusiastically to what other people say. They might spontaneously get inspired to quickly say something in response to what you said- a joke, an example from their own life, agreement, etc.- before giving the floor back to you. People with this style of talking view interruption as a sign that someone is interested in what they\u2019re saying. They enjoy the back and forth zing and banter of this kind of conversation. \n\nIn neither of these styles is it okay to simply disregard what the other person is saying to say what you want to say. It always has to be responsive.\n\nYour style of talking can be influenced by culture. I learned a bit late in life that my family\u2019s style of talking is the interrupting kind. Probably influenced by my Mom\u2019s culture where people have these loud rolling conversations. My Dad had a different background but a similar dynamic in his family. So conversations seem best when it\u2019s lively and witty, even though I\u2019m on the quiet side. The other style of talking is awkward for me. I never know when it\u2019s my turn to talk. I don\u2019t know if the people patiently waiting for me to finish my thought are interested in what I say.

It's like being a conversational ninja\u2014gentle but impactful. When someone cuts you off, try saying, 'Hold that thought\u2014I'm almost at the punchline.' This shows you're not folding your cards just yet.\n\nHowever, the art of conversation is as varied as the people we talk to. So, your strategy might need to be a bit more... bespoke. For instance, pointing it out gently can be an eye-opener for many. A simple, 'Did you know you often jump in before I finish?' can work wonders. It\u2019s like kindly holding up a mirror to their conversational habits\u2014they might not even realize what they\u2019re doing.\n\nAnd if subtlety isn\u2019t cutting it, why not try the 'Dramatic Pause'? When interrupted, stop talking, give them that gentle, knowing smile, and wait. It's not just a pause; it's a statement. Follow it up with a reflection, 'Just making sure you\u2019re finished. When you interrupt me, I wonder if it\u2019s because I\u2019m not giving you enough time to say what you want. Just trying to approach our conversation differently.' It\u2019s a classy way of saying, 'Your move, chief.'\n\nFeeling particularly audacious? Don\u2019t stop speaking when they interrupt. Continue your verbal journey until they cease. Once there\u2019s a pause, gently inquire, 'I've noticed you often talk over me. It makes me feel a bit unseen. What's up with that?' It\u2019s a conversation, not a competition, after all.\n\nAlso, why not have a meta-conversation about conversations? In a calm moment, ask how they prefer to exchange ideas and thoughts. It\u2019s like discussing the rules of engagement before the next friendly debate over dinner plans.\n\nLastly, embrace the power of humor and quirkiness. React to interruptions with a light-hearted, 'Was that the buzzer? Oh, I didn\u2019t realize we were on a game show!' or introduce a 'talking stick' at casual gatherings. It\u2019s a playful way to say, 'Let\u2019s share the stage.'\n\nRemember, navigating the choppy waters of dialogues with interrupters requires a mix of humor, patience, assertiveness, and a touch of creativity. With these tools in your conversational toolkit, you're not just responding to interruptions; you're sculpting a space where everyone's voice can be heard. Happy chatting!\"\n\nThis approach keeps the conversation light and humorous, while introducing several strategies to tactfully and effectively handle interruptions, acknowledging that different relationships and situations may require different tactics.\n\nOf course if all that and many other creative approaches fail, you can slap your hand down loudly on the table and yell \u201cthat\u2019s it you M F\u2019 if you can\u2019t shut the F up when I\u2019m speaking your dead to me\u201d  based on the reaction you can choose to ever talk to them again or not.", "First, understand it's okay to interrupt and be interrupted in casual conversations.", "Yes.

Same rules apply, but I had this awful interaction once where I was with 2 friends and 1 asshole. As soon as I was interrupted I kept going as normal, slightly raised my volume, and went from maintaining eye contact to burning a hole in their retinas.

Kinda irritating, especially when walking past a slatted fence when the sun is low. I heard that this is pretty common for those with blue eyes and thought it may extend to your tip. But I guess I was wrong...", "I usually think about pineapples when I'm going to sneeze and it stops it", "I have tried this and the vast majority of the time it works!", "And if you don\u00b4t want to sneeze, try licking your palate with your tongue - keep at it, until the the urge to sneeze subsides.", "You can even press your tongue to the roof of your mouth and it works!", "It\u2019s genetic and you\u2019re one of the lucky 10%!\nIf you\u2019re like me, try putting your finger across the bridge of your nose, just above the rounded tip, and pushing in lightly.

I learned that as a kid lol", "Tried and it didn't work. I was looking at the sun for 30 minutes waiting to have to sneeze, just saw the outline of the sun.
