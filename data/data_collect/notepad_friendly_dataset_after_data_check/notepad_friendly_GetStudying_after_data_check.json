I relate a lot because I'm in the same situation as you so just wanted to give u some of my advice. I'm writing a really competitive entrance exam this week and even though I have studied everything, my peers are just way ahead of me and way more focused than I am. I couldn't really understand why I struggled to score even 300+ while they were scoring 500 + marks.\nThis overall affected my confidence and I started to give up. But I realised that when I do the same exam questions at home, i get them right....not all of them but most of them. So I took my time to set aside my fear and start working on my basics and weak points and that helped me a lot. We may not be studying the same subject/course but i believe we are in the same situation so my advice to u is to prep as hard as u can by starting with your weak points.Give ur full focus to this for a few days and i believe you'll improve a lot.The only way to overcome anything is to face it head on with a lot of preparation.\nAll the best \ud83d\udcab\n(Sorry for any errors I'm not a native English speaker either)", "reply_created_utc": 1714457731.0}, {"index": "red7_s14_c3_", "comment_text": "Long story short, I fucked up.
