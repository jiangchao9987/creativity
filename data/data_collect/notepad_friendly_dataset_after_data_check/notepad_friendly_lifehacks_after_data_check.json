This move will require developers of third-party applications to pay enormous sums of money if they wish to stay functional, meaning that said applications (which include browsers like Reddit Is Fun, Apollo, and Relay for Reddit) will be effectively destroyed. In the short term, this may give Reddit the appearance of being more profitable than it truly is... but in the long term, it will undermine the platform as a whole.\n\nReddit relies on volunteer moderators to keep the platform welcoming and free of objectionable material. It also relies on uncompensated contributors to keep its numerous communities populated. The above decision promises to adversely impact both groups: Without effective tools, moderators cannot combat spammers, bad actors, or the entities who enable either; without the freedom to choose how and where they access Reddit, many contributors will simply leave. Rather than hosting creativity and in-depth discourse, the platform will soon feature only recycled content, bot-driven activity, and an ever-dwindling number of well-informed visitors. The very elements which differentiate Reddit \u2013 the fixtures which make it appealing \u2013 will be eliminated.\n\nWe implore Reddit to listen to its moderators, its contributors, and its everyday users; to the people whose activity has allowed the platform to exist at all: Do not sacrifice long-term viability for the sake of a short-lived illusion. Do not tacitly enable bad actors by working against your volunteers. Do not aim solely at your looming IPO while giving no thought to what may come afterward. If Steve Huffman's statement \u2013 \"I want our users to be shareholders, and I want our shareholders to be users\" \u2013 is to be taken seriously, then please consider this our vote:\n\nAllow the developers of third-party applications to affordably retain their productive (and vital) API access.\n\nAllow Reddit and Redditors to thrive.\n\n---\n\nMore information is available at /r/ModCoord. Discussion is actively taking place in /r/save3rdpartyapps. \n\n**Please follow /r/lifehacks's rules when participating and avoid brigading.**", "index": "red4_s0_", "post_comments": []}, {"post_title": "Make sure your pet is taken care of", "post_url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/lifehacks/comments/1ch0b2o/make_sure_your_pet_is_taken_care_of/", "created_utc": 1714502559.0, "text": "Having an emergency keychain for a pet is important in case the owner has their own emergency because it provides emergency responders or pet sitters with essential information to properly care for the pet in the owner's absence.

Which has caught this many in each trap (so basically we\u2019re killing 50 fruit flies a day (it\u2019s died down a bit more now thankfully) they are always around the kitchen (they slowly migrate to the living room and bedroom as those rooms are connected)\n\n\nHow can I fully get rid of them? Just this morning I have seen 3 flying around and killed 2. I just don\u2019t understand what else to do to get rid of them.\n\nFor context: we own no fruit or produce for the last week or so as I wanted to get rid of it all due to how bad it was getting. We also had maintenance completely replace our garbage disposal and have drain covers on all drains.\n\nAny advice would be so helpful!

You need a window for ventilation near the top half, and the bottom has a little tube opening to attach a small hose. Those blue Rinseroo hoses fit perfect but you need to crazy glue them on or they can slip off.\n\nYou will need about 8 inches of space between the ac and the wall for the vent to actually breathe.\n\nIt's gonna need to constantly drain downwards from the tube, but mine has worked reliably for 3 years. Right now I have mine in front of a window on a shelf, with the vent and tube going out the same window. I blocked it up with water proof material since it's humid and rains a ton.\nIt comes with a remote, and you can set it to dehumidify, fan, and a specific temp. \nI live in NC and got it when the built in AC units on the 5th wheel I was renting crapped out and the landlord couldn't replace them. I froze my boyfriend out mid summer one night, I was impressed!\n\n This AC worked perfect in there and is reasonable on electricity, just needs a 3 prong outlet.\n\nI have the hose perpetually watering flowers outside my window. I'd see if you could drain it from the window or the tub, or even toilet tank! The rinseroo is 30 bucks but it comes with nozzle adapters and if you can get the line hosing that would fit from the hardware store by thenfoot, the drain line will work as long as it's at an angle down no matter how long. So, it's adaptable.\n\nYou do have to wipe down the back filters under the faucet occasionally. Cat hair loves getting stuck in the filter screen and it can make it freeze solid and not actually cool.

Id really recommend looking up the top, lets say, 100 words in the language youre learning.

They live outside the house & come in daily.\n\n  \n\n\nFirst get a barrier spray. These sprays usually last for several months. Get one that has a battery sprayer, otherwise your hand will quickly tire out. Spray the entire foundation on the outside, a couple of feet wide. Be very generous spraying.\n\n  \n\n\nNext, using the same barrier spray. Spray all the pipes in the basement. The pavement ants love the moisture condensation on the pipes & frequently travel on the pipes. This is why the pavement ants frequently show up in the bathroom & kitchen areas where the pipes go. Obviously they also love the food in the kitchen.\n\nAlso do not forget to spray any cracks in the basement foundation, they may be getting in that way.  \n\n\nLastly, use the classic ant trap. The logic is the barrier spray will keep the ants out of the house & the ant traps will get the ants that are still inside.\n\nMy ant problems over the years have never been bad as yours, but on a couple occasions, my infant children would drop a food item off their high chair, & a swarm of ants would be there within five minutes.\n\n  \n\n\nFrom the sounds of your aunt problem, this will take a while, so do not get discouraged if it doesn\u2019t show progress in less than a week.\n\nI hope this helps, however if your problem is not pavement ants, then all of my advice is almost worthless.", "reply_created_utc": 1714229870.0}, {"index": "red4_s12_c2_", "comment_text": "As stated, I have a major ant problem.

If you really want to be effective, you can spray where they trail and then place advion ant gel bait there as well - same thing, they will feed it to the rest of their colony which kills them, but it works much slower than Terro so it actually gives them the opportunity to take the poison back to their nest.\n\nI\u2019d recommend researching these two products, don\u2019t get tempted by the quick fix of Raid or Terro, you\u2019ll end up just wasting your money if you have a serious infestation.\n\nEdited to add - visit r/antcontrol and take a look at the sticky.

Much easier to make it a ritual to go than apply on-site in the heat. Foundation brush for the win on application.\n\n2. Milk Carton frozen water the night before to chunk in cooler. Acts as ice and melts to give you cold water. One more you leave at the car that is not frozen to wash off sand. Get a cheap plastic car mat to stand on and toss it in  back. Protects those feet on asphalt/hot sand and keeps them sand free as you juggle them into the car. \n\n3. Cornstarch/baby power for sand removal.\n\n4. Baby pool, fill it up with sea water. Shade it. Instant close water source for getting sand off and a place for them to play.\n\n5. Mesh bags for toys and what not. Shake sand out.\n\n6. Zip lock bags of ice. Sand will get in cooler. Ice will get sand. Sand get in your mouth. Stick with light beers at the beach like red stripe or whatever it just that something heavy gets twice as heavy in the heat at the beach. You will dehydrate and it hits harder. Try to drink water often.\n\n7. Battery operated fan to clip onto something to blow on the little ones. Will drop them fast under shade to zonk land.\n\n8. Wash rag, cold water, back of neck. Oh my!\n\n9. Shade, shade, and more shade.\n\n10. Proper seat not a half seat a full on good seat/chair.  that may be harder but your enjoyment will go up by 10 fold.\n\n11. Can\u2019t tell you how much I love frozen grapes and those girly claw drinks at the beach and I a grown ass man. \n\n12. Flask. Full. Brown whiskey. Cold.\n\n13. If you got the room one of the wide wheel mules for all this shit get hauled to the waterfront.\n\n14.

No fragrances like most baby powders, usually cheaper than baby powder and no worries if anyone gets some in their mouth. \n\n\n\n- If you\u2019re going to a beach with waves, going at or a little before low tide usually makes for much calmer waters. It often leaves a big shallow area at the water\u2019s edge which is great for kids. We usually go in the afternoon so the lifeguards are still on duty but a lot of people have left for the day. When the kids are joining us, I don\u2019t like to take them to unguarded beaches. \n\n\n\n- Bring little spray bottles that have a fan attached help cool you off. \n\n\n\n- Bring 2-3 extra towels in addition to the usual 1 per person. Usually there\u2019s 4 of us here going together, 2 kids, ages 14 & 21, and 2 parents, so I always bring 6 towels for us. For kids under 5, I\u2019d bring 2 towels for each child. \n\n\n\n- Bring flip flops or other sandals, preferably ones that can get wet. I often see people take off the shoes right before stepping on the beach only to scorch their feet while walking to their spot. \n\n\n\n- Bring gallon sized ziplock bags. I use them to hold my phone and keys so they don\u2019t get wet or sandy. I also use them to store shoes that I don\u2019t want to get a 1/2 a beach worth of sand in. I put 1 shoe in each bag. I know my shoes will get some sand in there. That\u2019s usually unavoidable but the ziplock bags will prevent your kids from accidentally or intentionally dumping sand directly in there. They\u2019re also helpful for wet clothes. \n\n\n\n- I keep additional beach sized towels in the car to sit on and to use for a makeshift changing area.

Don\u2019t forget to put it on your ears and the tops of your feet too.\n4. Freeze bottles of water the night before so you constantly have cold water as they melt.\n5. Pack a small container of cornstarch to sprinkle on feet/legs before you get back in the car. It helps get the sand off easier.\n6. Pay attention to the flags that warn about dangerous surf, riptides, and/or dangerous ocean critters. Riptides can be present even if the water looks relatively calm.\n7.
