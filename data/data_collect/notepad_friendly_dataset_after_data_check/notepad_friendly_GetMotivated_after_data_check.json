You're starting to intuitively find the levers in the brain that are used to improve how you feel and effortlessly maintain that every day. Going to introduce the terms Goals, Systems, and Habits as the next-steps you're looking for.\n\nGoals take effort to perform. A goal of improving mood is motivating for action. Each of those actions performed, going to the gym instead of bed, consumed a little bit of willpower each day. Each day you wake up and have a limited amount of energy available that can be consumed by willpower tasks before feeling tired for the day. There is a risk that when accomplishing a goal -- my life is improved now -- that there is an empty feeling on the other side of that. That empty feeling is the place where your goal used to be. The goal motivated that energy. That empty feeling is the loss of motivation.\n\nSystems are better than goals. Consider training for a half marathon, a goal. You're motivated to apply yourself to follow the training program and willpower your way through. You run that half marathon! Then the day after you take a rest day. Then another. You take a whole month off from training. You broke the habit. The motivation is gone after checking off the goal. Instead a system is \"Each day I exercise for 30 minutes\". This is good. Your system serves up a new goal each time you complete a goal. Wake up. Exercise. Get a small dopamine boost for checking off the smaller bite sized goal of the day. This avoids the empty feeling that comes a day or two after completing a seemingly impossible goal by auto generating a new goal on the other side. With this you run a half marathon and the next day wake up with a goal waiting, exercise for 30 minutes. You do. And wake up and do it again. You run two half marathons. Run a third. You don't have a break in training. Because you wake up each day with a small easy goal to complete for a little dopamine boost. Systems are the lever in your brain for endless motivation.\n\nYou can run your life as a system of systems.\n\nWith repetition of a system the behaviors transform into habits. Each morning I wake up and read ten pages. Then exercise for 30 minutes. You begin to look forward to the dopamine boost of the small accomplishment to start the day. And eventually you feel slightly annoyed any time a change in plans disrupts that start -- this is a habit. Habits become effortless. You enjoy them.\n\nRephrasing your question you're looking for how to convert the actions your taking into a system that will help to translate those behaviors into habits, which are effortless. This is a good intuition to have noticed these things exist. Ties into Aristotle who also discussed of the importance of habits to make good choices effortless. And maps through classic works since then to more modern books.\n\nFraming is helpful as well. A frame doesn't have to be true, to be useful. \"Alcohol is poison\" is a short statement that for some people is sufficient to stop drinking. They start to look at alcohol as poison and become grossed out. Better if they have a whoop wristwatch or other sleep tracker and see how it destroys quality of sleep. I've applied this to energy drinks. Energy drink sounds positive. \"Heart attack can\" reframes the thing and sounds like something I wish to avoid. Can do the same with soda. \"Sodas are poison. Mix of random chemicals not found in nature blended and stored in a plastic lined aluminum.\"\n\n\"You can roll a bad habit into a marginally better habit\" You're already applying this. Can increment your way over time to slightly less bad habits. Then keep rolling those habits into marginally good habits.\n\n\"You do not have a choice whether to addict yourself to something, but you do have a choice what to addict yourself to.\" This frame is great. Can roll a habit into getting addicted to exercise. You're still exhibiting the same behaviors but you've guided them toward an activity that is pretty good payoff.\n\nThe great news is there's good books answering and expanding on your question.\n\n* How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. Expands on energy, systems, and goals.\n\n* Atomic Habits builds on an idea in How to Fail and expands it into a more formal study of moving actions into effortless habits.\n\n* Reframe Your Brain is a book collection of multiple reframes that do not have to be true, to be useful.\n\nYou've stumbled into a fun topic. Considering the brain as having buttons and levers is itself a frame. The book Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion from Cialdini is another look from the psychology end of the topic adds a layer of intuition to how to make use of your brain as a programmable thing. Improving your ability to find where the control panels are.\n\nOn the topic of goals and motivatio you may have seen friends or family retire after a long career and hit the doldrums. Not sure what to do with themselves and often sort of waste away. This is that conversation of systems over goals again. For many the need to earn money and pursue the impossible goal of retirement is on their horizon for decades. Then the impossible happens. They reach that goal. A few days after the satisfaction of it arrives comes the empty pit where their goal used to be. They need a new purpose for motivation on the other side of that. The personal finance and early retirement subreddit archives repeat that story over and over again. You can learn from it. Often if you realign your life now, you avoid hitting these crisis of purpose later. And where you put your energy actually makes money faster than in the other areas. Can resolve future midlife crisis, or post-retirement crisis moments in your 20s. Speed run lessons that usually take decades more to learn.", "reply_created_utc": 1714488520.0}, {"index": "red6_s2_c2_", "comment_text": "I've been in a pit for a whole year.

You skip the gym for a week due to some trip or unexpected routine, and you may simply forget about those habits.\n\nThe key is mindfulness, emotional regulation, and triggers to get you back to your positive feedback loop.  You'll need to be aware that \"hey, I'm doing this - is this what I want to do?\"  Psychologists say it's \"playing the tape through to the end\".  What is really going to happen and how you will feel if you lie in bed all day vs. doing positive things that you find joyful?  This is best done with a piece of paper and no tech.\n\nEmotional regulation through meditation, taking long walks, therapy, exercise, or journaling will also help you deal with negative emotions that arise and if you do fall back into the negative habit cycle.  Dopamine shuts off negative emotions, and since the brain knows dopamine release can increase pleasure and shut off negative emotions, negative emotions induce cravings for dopamine.  It's a very powerful feedback loop between the Nucleus Accumbens and the Amygdala that tech companies and food companies harness to keep you addicted to their products.  The goal is to use other parts of the brain to relatively weaken the Nucleus Accumbens' control of your actions.

In order to consistently choose the productive thing over the unproductive thing you need two components - wisdom/discernment, and discipline.\n\nThe wisdom/discernment piece is about knowing that the healthy and productive thing is. Sometimes, you just gotta burn the midnight oil and crank something out. Sometimes, you just gotta take the day off and relax. Knowing when to do one thing over another is wisdom and discernment. It seems to me that from your post you have a good start on the discernment piece.\n\nBut the discipline piece has to go with it. Without the will to do what you've discerned, it doesn't mean anything. Just like you, I'll ALWAYS prefer a soda to water. I don't see that desire going away. The way that I overcome my desire for unhealthy things is by disciplining myself to do the healthy and productive thing *first*. It doesn't mean that I never get a soda, but it means that I have to not have a soda for 5 days before I can have one. \n\nIt also helps to have gratitude. Sometimes, all people can focus on is what they're missing - they're missing their soda, their missing hanging out with friends, they're missing TikTok, they miss their bed. Their focus on what they are missing makes their life miserable. Instead, focus on having gratitude for what you DO have - be thankful for the gym you can go to, be thankful for a body that is getting stronger, be thankful that you have clean and plentiful water, be thankful that your studying leads to better grades, be thankful that you feel better. Learning to be thankful and express gratitude towards the things that you value makes discipline sustainable.\n\nHere is a short list of things that I do to maintain daily discipline. For what it's worth, I'm in my late 40's and have been doing this since I was about 20.\n\n* Daily meditation. This doesn't have to be long - mine was probably 3 minutes this morning - but it helps me focus on my goals, on gratitude, and gets me in tune with myself. This helps me know how hard to push, what to shift, who I am and where I'm going, and allows me to remember my values. Sometimes during meditation, you realize something, like \"This person isn't good to have in my life\" or \"I think I need to figure out how to be a better conversation partner\" or \"I think I'm getting burned out\" or \"I love my mom and should call her today.\" Remember those realizations and decide what to do about them. Some of them might take days or more to figure out. But some can be done today. Call your mom.\n\n* Routine. I'd like nothing more than to stay up until 2AM every night. But it's far more important for me to perform at work, which starts at about 8:30AM. I need to have a 10:30PM bedtime routine to stay mentally and physically healthy so that I can be satisfied with my work performance. The same goes for eating, for working out, and everything I've deemed of high importance in my life.\n\n* Rewards. Like I said before, I still drink soda, but it's  almost always a reward. Right now, I have a policy that I don't eat processed sugar during the week (Monday-Friday), and if I accomplish that, then I can have moderate portions of whatever I want during the weekend (like ice-cream or soda). This has been hugely successful for me. I don't think I could get away with denying myself completely. As a side note, this also help reset your dopamine reward system, which is so easily messed up in 21st century life.\n\n* Transitions. Use transitions to your benefit. In the \"rewards\" section above, the transition periods where I can and can't drink soda are \"weekdays\" and \"weekends\". These are natural transitions that allow me to mentally shift gears. I've found that creating my own arbitrary transitions isn't as effective. When I choose to institute a reward, or develop a routine, I'll find a natural transition point to implement it. It creates a mental \"box\" in which I can shift from one thing to another and maintain discipline and control over my animal nature.\n\nYou're going to fail at this. Failure is part of life.

You want a different life, which is totally fine.\n\nYou need to start being honest with yourself, to your husband and communicate these feelings. And you need to be the one reaching out to friends and building real bridges. Commit to seeing some friends, in person, within the next three weeks. Go and catch up.\n\nYou need to have a real, solid social life outside of your home life. Modern life is a lie in that it sets our partner up to be our best friend, confidant, lover...etc. but the truth is that no one single person can fulfill all of those roles, and being more social and finding out new things about yourself is all part of the journey. Just be honest to your husband about where you're at because the last thing you want to do is bring children into a situation you feel trapped in.\n\nAlso one last thing - the people who you see waking up at 6, eating clean three meals and sleeping well are set in a routine that probably took them years to establish. You can get there, but you need to have purpose and discipline to hold yourself accountable when you least want to. Make yourself uncomfortable on purpose and do this every single day. I like cold showers and working out. Those people you see - the secret is that it's also uncomfortable for them to do what they do to (everyone wants to sleep and lounge around), they just have a better routine so it's more automatic than it will be for you. And the benefits are more in the forefront of their minds (they'll feel terrible if they don't workout for a week, where that might be your current baseline).\n\nGood luck.", "reply_created_utc": 1714446545.0}, {"index": "red6_s6_c32_", "comment_text": "My entire life I was fascinated with getting married.

Since our days are only 2 and in one of them we are dead\n\nWhat i take from this is that we only have 2 days. The day we have and the day we dont. And in one of them we are dead. You could expand it to time: we have the time he have (right now) and the time we dont. You keep using the time you have to have a civil war in your head and the conclusion (whether you want to or not) is to shift the responsibility to the you who is \u201cdead\u201d (shifting responsibility to a time you dont have)\n\nSince im a gamer i think of it as when you play a single player game but have a few friends over. The rule usually is you have to pass the controller when you die. So if we replace \u201cdie\u201d to: being stuck in analysis paralysis, fear, or any thought or circumstance that doesnt move you forward towards your goals then you HAVE to pass the controller to a you that just does it. \n\nSo how have i actually implemented this? Believe it or not using workout structures (sets and reps). Gotta clean my room and dont know where to start? 1. Acknowledge im stuck and i gotta pass controller\n2. New player has to do 1 set of 10 reps of putting something in its place (doesnt matter if its efficient, very well placed, or whatever. The purpose is to go through the motions.\n3. After one set determine if you need to make another set or if youre stuck again and need to \u201cpass the controller\u201d (passing the controller could be the equivalent of becoming the \u201cvariant\u201d of yourself that does it regardless if its a crappy job that barely passes the bare minimum)\n\nHope this works and dm me if you want to bounce ideas or problems.

Don't wait for motivation, learn to get disciplined and motivation will come from taking action and achieving little milestones.\n2. You can't go 0-100 in regards to being disciplined. Discipline is like a muscle. You must find your current \"strength\" and build on that.\n3. There's no such thing as waiting to find out your passion. You learn your passion by doing and figuring out what you don't like- this way you could find out what you do like.\n4. If you choose to do multiple things at once, you'll be alright in all of them.

People in college especially tend to value heroics and all nighters because that's what works....right up until it doesn't. But heroics may not be enough for you here.

Go for a walk. All you have to do is walk around the block. Once you are moving, you can choose to walk more or go back inside. All you must do is go for a walk of any length, at least 5/7 days a week. \n\n2. Find easy, healthy meals to meal prep. Make sure you have accessible food for your meals, and you aren't looking at an enpty fridge when you are hungry, leading to eating out. It will take time to build these habits, so be kind to yourself and take things one step at a time. \n\nFirst, know what you will eat for breakfast, like granola with fresh berries thrown on top with yogurt,  toast peanut butter milk and fruit, etc. Make it consistent. Make sure you aren't having problems with breakfast before tackling lunch, as little as a week, and as much as a month.\n\nNext, do lunches. For lunches, sandwiches and wraps are fast, and you can vary them with different meats, veggies, and sauces. I like using hummus in sandwiches, especially since I avoid cheese. This will be easier since you have practice, but still give yourself time and grace to make sure you've got this.\n\nFinally, dinner time. It doesn't have to take forever to cook dinner, i spend less than 2 total hours a week cooking for all my meals.Some ideas for meal prep meals: chicken thighs (teriyaki, cajun spice mix, chicken schwarma, italian spice mix, etc.) A veggie (salad, frozen steam veggies, carrots/cucumber etc.)  And a carb (rice, bread, or pasta). There are a lot of cheap meal prep cotainers. You will cook twice a week, prepping for 3 and 4 days. Chicken thighs take 10 minutes to cook on the stove, and once you get the timing down, making something like chicken teryaki with rice and steamed broccoli will take you 30-45 minites to cook and store 4 meals. \n\n3. Increase how much you move and find and exercise you enjoy. I joined a boxing gym. You could join a rec sports league, go for hikes at whatever distance works for you, take up biking, join an in the park yoga class, dance, any activity that gets you moving that you enjoy and can see yourself doing. Try this out at any time. It can take time to find something you like. But once you do it, it will be a lot easier to get yourself moving.\n\n4. Once you've done all of this, it will be a month or 5 later. See where you are at. Are you seeing the kind of progress you want? Do you have the energy to modify or add another fitness habit? After the first 2 weeks, you should aim for 2 lbs or less lost a week. Faster can be bad for your health, but the first two weeks see a lot of water dumping which can lead to extreme weight loss of like 10 lbs in the first week when starting to seriously work on it.", "reply_created_utc": 1714393090.0}, {"index": "red6_s11_c2_", "comment_text": "I\u2019m 21F and I\u2019m struggling with my eating habits and I have no idea how to eat healthy or sustainably.

Half or more of your groceries should be from the refrigerated section and fresh/unprocessed fruits, veg and lean meats. \n\n3. Don\u2019t buy things like chips or easy unhealthy snacks for home. Treat yourself like a junk food addict and remove the temptation. Food should require some error to make so you don\u2019t mindlessly snack.\n\n4. Get 20-30 minutes of cardio a day. A brisk walk can do that. Then you can graduate to a jog if you want. \n\n5. Monitor calories with a Fitbit or other smart watch.

You can still grab fast food, but choose healthier options. Grilled chicken sandwiches, salads with lean protein, or veggie wraps are all good choices.\n\nQuick and easy meals that won't stress you out! There are tons of healthy recipes that take no time to make. Websites and apps have tons of ideas! Focus on meals with veggies, lean protein, and whole grains for a filling and nutritious option.\n\nCook once, eat all week! Make a big batch of healthy food on the weekend and portion it out for the week. This saves time during busy days and helps you avoid unhealthy choices.\n\nMake it a social thing! Cook with friends or family, or take turns making healthy meals for each other. This makes healthy eating more fun and keeps things interesting.\n\nFind your reason to shine!  Why do you want to eat better and move more? More energy? Better health? Having a clear goal in mind helps you stay motivated.\n\nCelebrate the small stuff! Did you walk for 10 minutes today? Awesome! Acknowledge your progress, big or small. Treat yourself to something you like for sticking with it.\n\nDon't go it alone! Talk to your friends and family about your goals. There are also online communities for healthy eating and exercise. Having a support system helps you stay on track.\n\nStart slow and steady wins the race! Don't try to run a marathon tomorrow. Start with small, achievable exercise goals, like a 10-minute walk a few times a week. Gradually increase the time or intensity as you get stronger.\n\nFind something you actually enjoy! Try different activities like dancing, swimming, or a team sport. You're more likely to stick with something you find fun.\n\nFocus on how good you feel!  Exercise isn't just about burning calories.

Don't ever do the bare minimum to fight adversity. Absolutely crush anything in your way. Don't ever be happy with only just overcoming something.\n\nSelf reflection is incredibly important. No excuses. Literally sit down and make a list of the good things and bad things about yourself. Praise yourself for your good aspects and make a plan to work on the less desirable elements. None of this impacts your attractiveness btw. Its all about being a better human.\n\nDownload an app such as Yuka and make sure to only eat foods that have no hazardous additives and minimise sugar.

In our society the social pressure is to *spend* money.\n\n\nFortunately, it has never been easier in the US to be financially independent.\n\n\nThat does not make it easy, of course, but the cost of basic necessities compared to median income is very low. More jobs basics like health insurance and retirement plans than ever.\u00a0\n\n\nThe most difficult thing is distinguishing between *needs* and *wants*.\n\n\nHaving shelter is a *need*, living in a standing structure is a *want*, having a room to yourself is a *want*, having an apartment to yourself is a *want*, having a building to yourself is a *luxury*.\n\n\nA car is not a *need*. A new car is a *luxury*.\n\n\nFood is a *need*. Meat is a *want*. Packaged food is a *want*. Eating out is a *luxury*.\n\n\n**I chose these examples because shelter, transportation and food are Americans largest budget items. If you get these right you'll have an easier time. If you get these wrong no amount of \"cutting out lattes\" will save you.**\n\n\nPersonal example:\n\n\n- I make roughly **4x** the median personal income.\n\n\n- I **split** a three bedroom condo with three other strangers\n\n\n- I drive a car that is **16 years** old\n\n\nI recognize that these things are *wants*. I *could* get by on a bicycle and I *could* split a room. I decided to spend the extra money on a car and my own room in a shared condo. I decided these things are worth it to me.\n\n\nMy own house is *not* worth it to me.\n\n\nThese are personal decisions, but the thing to be careful of is the enormous social pressure pushed by marketing to live alone and drive a new car.

I am approaching 40 and my experience from being 18 and on my own was the following:\n\nYou had jobs you could get but they paid 8-12 dollars an hour. 12 dollars an hour was living large for that age.\n\nNo one had money for stuff we just expect as normal now. Like we'd go to a movie and one friend wouldn't want to go because they didn't have the cash.\n\nGas was like 99 cents a gallon but it was unheard of to drive somewhere without splitting it up. Like sure dude ill go an hour away to this thing, split the gas with me?\n\nIt was much harder to find roommates because 1 bedrooms WERE affordable back then. My friends moved into either studios for $500 per month or split 2 or 3 bedrooms and paid $300 per month. Since 1 bedroom apartments were affordable by most young people, it was much harder to find roommates unless you had a bunch of close friends also looking.\n\nWe didn't have cell phones OR house phones sometimes, communicating with people was done mostly through aol instant messenger, or irq, or forums. Finally having friends with cell phones was a game changer but you couldnt really text it was too expensive. Quick calls to get someone to meet up was it.\n\nI guess my point is... live life like this as a young person. Get roommates, grab a job at $15 an hour, don't spend money, and just live life the fun way. Grab a handle of bacardi or a 30 pack or a 3 dollar bottle of wine with your buddies and relax - stop trying to keep up with the social media superstars.\n\nMy advice would be to get a job that is decent paying but still forces you to build real-world skills. Like a teller at a bank or sales or even entry level desktop support until you get a job in your industry after college. Learn to influence people in person and make friends with strangers and build some confidence.\n\nThen focus on keeping your monthly expenses as LOW AS POSSIBLE to give you freedom and enjoy your freedom.

I came up with the five minute rule. \n\nWhenever I got an assignment, I would write down the assignment and the time and I would look at my schedule for the next spare five minutes. Literally as soon as possible, often it was right then if I didn't have another class to get to. \n\nWhen that five minutes is available, start a timer for five minutes and try to complete the entire assignment within that five minutes. The point is not to do your best work, but to do as much of the assignment as you possibly could in just five minutes, with the condition that you have to touch on every part of the assignment. You can't just do the first five minutes, and you're not going for the most points either, so not the easiest fine minutes, but rather something from each part of it. \n\nFor a paper, this could be a thesis and a quick outline. For math or could be a summary of the problem set and all the topics covered. \n\nWhy? The work you produce can't possibly be any good. So what's the point? \n\nWell, that is one point. I found i often procrastinate because I'm waiting for inspiration so I can do the perfect job. That never happens, do I end up starting the night before it's due. This five minute rule makes it absurd that you would do a decent job, do you know have permission to start and produce a big pile of garbage. \n\nBut in that five minutes, you will familiarize yourself with exactly what needs to be done for every part of the assignment. You will identify any gaps that you have, either in knowledge or the instructions, and you can immediately go to the prof or the ta or office hours or the library or your peers and get clear on what the assignment is and what knowledge you'll need to complete it.\n\nAfter awhile of doing this, you will also get very good at estimating how much effort this assignment will take. At first, this will be difficult, so just use a three point scale. A 1 just takes an hour or two. A 2 is going to take a weekend or a week after classes of working on here and there. A 3 is a project that you'll work on as long as the class is going. Over time, as you produce breakdowns and outlines of assignments, you'll find yourself attaching estimates to the bits of the assignment instead of the assignment as a whole, and you'll develop a richer scale that works for you. \n\nYou'll also start scheduling these bits, put them down on your calendar so you can start to organize your time around when to do those bits.\n\nIf you're like me, over time you'll find that once you get started and you've identified all the easy parts of a task that you already know how to do, you'll just do them right away. This means even if you don't touch that assignment again for all the hard stuff, you've already got SOMETHING you can hand in if you totally forget about that task. But it also means that you're engaged with it early, you've already started, and you can chip away at it. If you encounter something really tough, you can reach out to peers in the class and start conversations around it early and see if people have any tips before you go into office hours.\n\nIn a sense, what this rule does is structure your work like it's a video game where you don't think about jumping in, you just five into level 1, plot out a course, and then level up step by step.

But please please please be patient with yourself and don\u2019t attach your worth to your ability to make friends, it\u2019s mainly luck and once you\u2019re able to surround yourself with people you like it\u2019ll go up from there and it won\u2019t be so hard.

The key is for you to do things around people who you might find interesting as much as possible. If you read, go read in a public park with lots of people. If you like watching Netflix, download the show and go watch it on a beach/ public area. You have to be open to people approaching you or you approaching people. No headphones, no closed off body language, always friendly and approachable. Join clubs, go to church, go to outdoor activities (yoga in the park etc) and within no time you will have tons of acquaintances. You then need to build those relationships to friendships by spending time with the people you like. Friendships are built with literally time spent with someone. I believe it takes 70 hours for people to feel bonded. A little hack is go on trips or overnight  events with people to get those hours in.

It\u2019s important to remember that life is a balance of growth and connection. While it\u2019s great to invest time in learning and personal development, human connections play a crucial role in our overall happiness and well-being.Starting to build a social circle can feel daunting, especially if you\u2019re starting from scratch. However, think of it as an extension of what you already do well: learning and growing. Making friends is a skill that can be learned. Start small by joining clubs or groups that align with your interests. Whether it's a book club, a local meetup, or an online forum that focuses on your hobbies, these are places where you can meet people with shared interests.Additionally, volunteering is a wonderful way to meet new people while giving back to the community. It can make you feel part of something bigger and connect you with people who have a nurturing spirit.Remember, every friendship starts with a simple conversation. It\u2019s okay to take small steps. Sometimes, just spending time in communal places like cafes, libraries, or parks can open opportunities for casual interactions that lead to friendships.It\u2019s also valuable to engage in some introspection. Reflect on what you truly value in friendship and what kind of friend you wish to be. This will guide you in choosing the right people and building strong, meaningful connections.Be patient with yourself.

First, you should define the kinds of things you want to do. There are apps like Eventbrite and Meetup that often have groups that cater to different interests. If it's something such as dance, look around for dance studios that offer adult classes and/or social dances for their students. It is a great way to begin to meet people regularly. Another point I'd like to make is sometimes those of us that like peace and somewhat solitary activities need to lean into that part of ourselves. Focus on finding special interest or niche events and having one regular friend that shares that passion with you to attend those types of things. Friend groups are usually formed after repeated interactions at certain clubs, organizations or events. Bear in mind as well that you are in the adult world now and that everyone around you has complex lives. You will see your homies less. The last thing I'll say is sit down and try to memorize some of those \"get to know someone\" questions. A lot of people love meeting that one person that day who just sat down and listened to them for a while, so be sure to study up on those listening skills as well.

The truth is, it\u2019s simply not enjoyable. And since the main drive behind the efforts of social media creators today has become profiting off of the viewers at any price, the content has become like a ghoulish hell realm. Just look at the default start screen of YouTube. Those thumbnails are fucking demonic. I can\u2019t fathom how Google let\u2019s all this shit pass, especially knowing children are watching it. The promoted content is catering to the absolute worst in us, and is completely devoid of honesty, auhenticity and creativity.
