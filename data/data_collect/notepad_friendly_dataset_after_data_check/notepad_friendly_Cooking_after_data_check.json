Whisk well.\n\nThen, pan in one hand and whisk in the other, heat over a medium flame, whisking without letup or hin- drance. Scour every corner of the pan rapidly, and never take your hand off the handle. Hollandaise made this way happens like lightning. As soon as it begins to reach the consistency of thick custard, back away from the stove, stirring constantly, and walk to the spot where you have set aside a generous two table- spoonfuls of butter. Throw that in and continue whisking. By the time the butter dissolves, you will have perfect and foolproof Hollandaise.\n\n(There is a knack to it, of course, but once it is learned, ou will be able to bring off a ust remember the basic proportions and multiply accordingly superb sauce in three minutes. or larger quantities: For every egg yolk, of cream and two of butter.

I only take a few bags here and there to make sure the rest of the family can also have their share. So when I cook those particular peas, it\u2019s a big deal to me. They\u2019re special.

I told her all she needed to do was salt and pepper them to taste and they\u2019d be perfect.\n\nApparently she got drunk while she was cooking the meal and ended up adding some very random ingredients to the peas. She can\u2019t remember what exactly she added now, but she DOES remember that peanut butter was involved for some god-forsaken reason. \n\nThe next day I was seriously looking forward to some homemade peas and cornbread that I didn\u2019t have to cook myself, only to find the peas were basically inedible. And not only did she ruin the peas with peanut butter and god only knows what other random ingredients, she also decided to cook ALL of the bags I had. We had an entire XL pan of these tainted peas that no one would touch, not even her! \n\nEven my husband, who is the least picky eater of our house, couldn\u2019t eat all the weird peas she cooked.

Pumpkin seeds are very good for this as they have their own coagulent in the seed itself so you dont need to buy any. If I were you I would really consider exploring alternatives to soy-based tofu, there are a lot of resources online for this. Other options are vegan protein powders which you can use as ingredients for things like vegan fish cakes etc that give you a substantive ingredient to cook with in braises/stir fries etc. \n\nMy assumption is that you may be trending toward eating less meat because of sustainability and if that is the case you may want to consider consuming sustainable animal proteins rather than cutting them out completely. Farmed mussels for example have a very positive effect on the environment when done properly, they purify the water they are grown in and do not require any feeding thus reducing CO2 emissions to logistics and operations like any regular farm.

Agar is cheap and has been shown to have many health benefits. Both can be used to make colorful and attractive desserts. \n\nFermenting is a cheap hobby for making your own tasty foods. Fermented food is good for your stomach. For whatever reason, be it stress, food additives, or microplastics, gut issues are increasing among millenials and gen Z. Fermented foods are also common in East Asian food, which is having a moment right now. \n\nEvidence for a comeback: \n\nAlready, food and fitness influencers are making fruit and vegetable gelatin blocks and calling them 'gut friendly gummies'. Jello shots have made a resurgence in higher end bars. The New York times has featured highly rated jello mold desserts in recent holiday seasons. East Asian desserts featuring agar are gaining traction on social media. Gelling agents are common in high end food where 'caviar' is made with sodium calcinate and fruit or vegetable juices. Agar is also common in vegan cheeses. As plant based food becomes more mainstream, its use will spread. \n\n  \nFermented foods: These are already going strong in the food influencer sphere. There are whole accounts dedicated to experimental fermenting. 'Slow food', fomerly the purview of ethical meat production movements are also catching on to fermenting. It's particularly trendy in plant based food circles.

Literally everywhere. Avocados on everything really started closer to 20 years ago. Most of what you mentioned is older as a food trend than the time period you specified. \n\nUbe is a newer trend, as you mentioned. Hot honey and sriracha I would say is more a thing since 2015, even more so since maybe 2019. I think you nailed that. I would suggest also that we've been seeing better application of different varieties of salt more in the last 5 years or so, and that more exotic salts are becoming big trends with some high end specialty salts being sold in blocks to consumers for hundreds of dollars. \n\nI think we're going to start seeing spicy powders more. For example, you dehydrate jalapenos then pulverize them into a fine powder used to dust foods. I think that's going to become extremely common especially with pepper varieties such as poblano, hot Hungarian wax, etc and will be used to better infuse certain foods such as pasta dough and pizza dough. This is still extremely rare in the places I've been traveling. \n\nI think primitive / ancient grains are going to continue to gain ground beyond the more common Quinoa and Millet. I think Teff, Farro, and Khorasan are going to become a lot more common. And I think different methods of growing those grains are going to result in them becoming common in dining. \n\nI also think we're going to see a resurgence in eggplant especially in mid-range dining. We're actually already seeing this in my area, with eggplant and aubergine being used to make meat-like foods. I had a dish over the weekend consisting of meatballs made from eggplant covered in Pomodoro sauce made from San Marzano tomatoes served over zucchini and leek pasta. I was expecting a real shitshow but, it has been the best meal I've had all month - which is really saying a lot given my scope in cuisine and the amount of extremely good foods I get to sample with any regularity. \n\nI also think that the simple french omelet - not American diner omelets, actual french omelets - might become a much more visible menu item in a lot of markets where they are not currently common.

Nashville chicken had a moment.  Wendy's used to be the only popular chain with a spicy chicken sandwich, now they all have one.\n* Chinese chili crisp.  Was never super big, but was something that got big in some niche circles\n* Fake meat, beyond burger, etc.\n* Not exactly a traditional food trend, but the increased popularity of energy drinks.  They've been around since the 1990s (I recall Red Bull back around 2000), but if you go to a 7-11, seems like half the space is reserved for energy drinks and there are new ones to replace Red Bull like Monster (been around a while) and Celsius.\n* Not entirely a food trend, but better non-alcoholic options like non-alcoholic beer and mixed drinks.\n* Fusion Korean has been a thing in the US like 20 years, like Korean fried chicken, Korean tacos.\n* Not a food thing, but a food equipment thing: instant pots and air fryers.\n\nIt's not exactly the kind of food trend you're talking about, but reduced sugars (due to A1C) has become important.\n\nI think you'll see more vegetarian options as people think they should cut down on meat (the price might affect it).  If it weren't for the fact it's tofu, I think mapo tofu is kind of a great example, which only uses a little meat just for flavoring.\n\nI'm still waiting for Sichuan peppercorns to make more of an impact creating its own distinct kind of heat (mala, or numbing).\n\nI'd like to see more kinds of veggies like you find at an Asian grocery store.\n\nI honestly thought grocery stores would go the direction of Hello Fresh and offer do-it-yourself kits without the hassle of having to order 6 a week, but that never happened.\n\nI'm seeing more mangos around, but not sure people know how to deal with them.

That's the issue with being immune compromised is certain things can send us to the hospital. \n\nI got food poisoning for the first time in years and it sent me into passing out on the toilet and to the emergency with all my chronic illnesses. I was going hypoglycemic and crashing hard as a diabetic so I was just shaky for days and havkng my GCM go off. I was bedridden nauseous. My husband didn't feel well and sucked but it wasn't THAT. He was fine after a few days and I wasn't for weeks so he had me on the couch bekng watched by his mom. I wasn't allowed to shower alone upstairs, he would sit there as I was a passing out risk. \n\nI think that a way to have eased her was to poke it with a thermometer and show her its fine. Yes it's small pieces but you can still read a temp on it. \n\nI'd try not to take it defensively as she's not trying to insinuate you are not a good cook or stupid. I think this is where you're getting at it hates how it makes you feel and now you want to then avoid a entire category of meat to... avoid a situation but it fixes nothing. You two talk and reflect where her fear comes from and find a way to gain trust permanently than dismiss this incident. She is trying to protect herself from illness and that is kinda a shitty and miserable thing to constantly monitor. It totally fucks with your head and healthy people seriously cannot understand how thats like. It really sucks to have to ask for accommodations and often makes us feel so much shame and guilt. Yes, maybe her anxiety is a bit high on it because it seriously is terrifying, and that should require a talk to find a happy medium for all to be harmonious. Yall are living together so not addressing things just breeds tension and resentment. \n\nValidate you understand her fear and assure her that you want to make sure she's safe as you understand how she is at more risk than everyone else. However, you feel a bit hurt that you feel like you can't be trusted and it's frustrating when you're just trying to make nice variety of foods and not have boring stuff. You will do what is by food safety guidelines but that also baking everything isn't from a place of rationality but pure fear.  Find out if a temp check would ease her mind then that's a 30 second thing you can show her as it gets off the pan that its holding steady if it hits that 165, it is safe. Maybe a lack of education on her part on food safety and handling would help her feel more informed on your choices. Perhaps some videos on packaging has cook suggestions but the key there is the safety temp not the oven. So many good resources you guys can watch and discuss together may help her put her fear into reality.\n\nEDIT, a bunch of my friends are pro chefs. If there's any way we can help DM me. Maybe she'd listen to pros? Feel better to ask experts?  I'm immune compromised and my bar has zero demerits for 10 fucking years straight so I take food contamination seriously. I have an active food handlers and bartenders cards. I owned a cookie bakery.

If my immune cells are dipping particularly low I am more careful to follow the diet.

Chili. Chili dogs. BLT. PB&J. Potato salad (just please no raisins lol).\n\nAgree with a ton of the others, but generally I'd add: if you can, take some trips to bigger cities and/or parts of Ohio where she can enjoy American Chinese, Mexican, Thai, Korean, Japanese, Indian, etc. etc. food/restaurants, as well as fusion food. Many flavor profiles from these cuisines will be familiar to her, but she can experience some of the best food the US has to offer--and it's all from people who immigrated here and opened restaurants/launched cuisine here. Things like orange chicken, pad thai, chicken tikka masala were all made to appeal to Western palettes, for instance. Some of this you could cook at home, but imo it's best to go to restaurants in cities known for various cuisines. A fun trip to LA, for example, could help you knock out a ton of amazing cuisine (and she could try Filipino American restaurants too!). Or take her to the Bay Area, specifically Daly City, which is one of the largest Filipino American communities in the US.\n\nGenerally track down your nearest Asian food market so she can shop. What's available will be depending on where you are in Ohio and the dominant immigrant groups. Looks like there's a Chucay's in Columbus, which is a Filipino store. But imo it would be smart to go to Asian markets so she can buy familiar-ish ingredients so she can cook what she enjoys. I'd also look into any Philippine Independence Day events near you (will be on or around June 12) and see if there's a local Filipino community center she can join. I imagine it'll be massive culture shock for her to be in Ohio, but if she can find the Filipino American community nearby, they're always really wonderful! (source: I work in international television marketing and one of my primary markets is Filipino) OH and whatever your local TV service is, subscribe to TFC so she can watch her shows! If it's not available on cable (guessing you have Spectrum or Xfinity? Both should have TFC), try YouTube TV in the next few weeks. Or, she can direct subscribe to iwantTFC and stream it.

We\u2019ve spent decades exploring cuisine from all over the world.\n\nWe also spent 25 years living in Ohio (North Coast) but know Cincinnati and its environs pretty well.  It was a challenge finding restaurant food that matched our taste for international food or the best that US cuisine had to offer.\n\nOn the positive side Ohio has amazing ingredients and if you dig and explore you can usually find everything you need for the best U.S. dishes and most international cooking.\n\nI\u2019m actually pretty familiar with Filipino cuisine  which, unlike a lot of Asian food, tends to be low on spice, and rely a lot on garlic, onion, ginger, black pepper, bay leaf, salt, tomato, sweet pepper, fish oil for flavor and relies on sweet, sour, and bitter notes with a lot of fermented flavors.\n\nThe closest American equivalents are classic real Southern and Creole cooking:\n\n\u2014Real Carolina Rice\n\u2014Cornbread \n\u2014Black eyed peas and Pigeon Peas cooked in molasses\n\u2014Okra\n\u2014Greens in onion and ginger\n\u2014Grilled barbecue chicken (though I would expose her to fried chicken\n\u2014The huge variety of American squash (squash is big in the Philippines but all sorts of new types to try\n\u2014Gumbo\n\u2014Etouff\u00e9e\n\u2014The amazing heirloom tomatoes you can find in Ohio farmers markets.\n\u2014The amazing melons you can find in Ohio. Farm stands\n\u2014Corn Fritters with maple syrup\n\u2014Fried corn with bacon\n\u2014Jambalaya \n\u2014Shrimp and Grits\n\nI could list off 40 more.\n\nIn the meantime I don\u2019t think Five Guys chili should be consumed by anybody.\n\nAlso, given some of the amazing farm produce and outstanding pork you can find in Ohio, you guys should work on your own fusion of Filipino cooking techniques with local ingredients because it should be yummy.\n\nYou will probably blow the socks off friends and family.\n\nOne last thing\u2014Apple fritters.", "reply_created_utc": 1714459088.0}, {"index": "red8_s9_c95_", "comment_text": "This post was removed from r/askculinary because it was too open ended of a question.
