{"post_title": "The Q2 2024 AskEngineers Salary Survey", "post_main_text": "# Intro\n\nWelcome to the AskEngineers quarterly salary survey! This post is intended to provide an ongoing resource for job hunters to get an idea of the salary they should ask for based on location and job title. Survey responses are NOT vetted or verified, and should not be considered data of sufficient quality for statistical or other data analysis.\n\nSo what's the point of this survey? We hope that by collecting responses every quarter, job hunters can use it as a supplement to other salary data sites like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Glassdoor and PayScale to negotiate better compensation packages when they switch jobs.\n\n> [Archive of past surveys](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/search/?q=flair%3A%22salary+survey%22&include_over_18=on&restrict_sr=on&t=all&sort=new)\n\n## Useful websites\n\nFor Americans, BLS is the gold standard when it comes to labor data.

For example, the Canadian counterpart to BLS is [StatCan](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start), and [DE Statis](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Labour/Labour-Market/Employment/_node.html) for Germany.\n\n* [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/member/home/index.htm)\n\n* [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/)\n\n# How to participate / Survey instructions\n\nA template is provided at the bottom of this post to standardize reporting total compensation from your job.

We initially planned to have a tent, but the weather gods seem to be working in our favor & we can go without the tent; unfortunately I planned on using the tent structure to mount the very necessary disco ball. \n\nNow, I need to devise a way to hang the disco ball & motor (\\~6lbs) over the courtyard dance floor, which measures 25' W x 45' L. ([Sketch](https://imgur.com/a/EASF5at))\n\n**Objective:**\n\n* Develop a temporary and sturdy structure to hang a disco ball and motor directly over a 25' wide courtyard.\n\n**Constraints:**\n\n* The structure must span at least 25 feet, ideally placing the disco ball at the courtyard's center.\n* It needs to support the disco ball without excessive flexing for smooth operation.\n* No screws or permanent fixtures can be used on the building\u2019s roof, siding or interior. \n\n**Requirements:**\n\n* The structure should be easy to construct and dismantle.\n* It needs to be cost-effective as it will only be used once; quick availability is crucial as the party is this Saturday.\n\n**Current Thoughts:**\n\n* Ideally, a simple rectangle structure of 30+ feet \n   * Additional length to provide reasonable overhang/support/anchoring on roof\n   * Additional length also utilizes the increasing height of the gabled roof \n   * Unfortunately any material to accomplish this may be to expensive / not available? \n* Materials considered include:\n   * Steel/aluminum - potentially expensive\n   * PVC - potentially flimsy - Contemplating if a PVC truss design could work ([video to a diy here](https://youtu.be/-u7fljouPik?si=uU50LabCPYNIgnR6)), or if there was some type of way to help suspend/reinforce it. \n      * I assume the DIY Truss would be strong enough, but it is alot of work for a single use - the costs may creep up as well with all the necessary couplings. \n   * Wires or cables are considered but might not be feasible without secure anchoring points. They also may be to flimsy for the motor of the disco ball to work. \n   * Any combination of the above\n      * Could potentially use the windows on the second floor of the width side to create some type of wired support - but how would i anchor the wires without drilling? The courtyard is also open, leaving those support options to be unbalanced (meaning, would having tension supports from only one side not help?)\n\n**Questions for the Forum:**\n\n* What materials and designs are recommended for creating a stable and economical structure capable of spanning more than 25 feet?\n* Are there innovative ways to position the disco ball near the center without needing to span the entire courtyard width?\n* What methods would you suggest for securely mounting the structure given the constraints?\n* DIY PVC Truss - I feel like this may be my best bet, especially if i can make the sections a lot longer. \n   * How can i determine if this will be strong enough?\n   * Is there a way to maximize the length of each section to reduce the amount of couplings / cost? \n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* I am aware they make standalone discoball tripods - they are expensive for a single use, and tbh look lame (not centered or above everyone).\n* Truss Rental - I have called around, my needs are too small.\n* The length sides of the courtyard have gabled roofs that slope down into the courtyard - those structures are fairly symmetrical in height / roof.\n* [Sketch of the courtyard](https://imgur.com/a/EASF5at)", "llm_annotation": "A", "answers": ["To come up with solutions for the temporary, cost-effective structure to hang a disco ball over the 25' wide courtyard, follow these steps:\n\n1.

I haven't been given their engineering information for these products because the former engineer that worked here was not very organized and so no one has it all in one place. I've been learning everything I can about chains and sprockets using other similar catalogs and ANSI/BS standards. I am struggling to understand some things about the sprockets aspect despite several days of searching.

I apologize if these are very basic questions and I just did a poor job trying to find the answers but I am a graphic designer, not an engineer or mathematician.  \n\n\n1) Why do tooth counts in product listings skip? For example in the Tsubaki and Martin sprocket catalogs 35 sprocket teeth jump from 36 to 40 and I do not understand why that is. I worry that if someone was following the formulas to determine a roller chain selection the math might point them to a 37 tooth sprocket and when they go to check the dimensions of it there will be none to tell them what, say, the maximum bore is and then they won't know if it can fit on the shaft. Is there a reason why some tooth numbers just don't exist?  \n2) If most roller chains go up to 6 strands why have I only been able to find information on up to triple sprockets? Or in the case of 25 roller chain only single sprockets despite the chain having up to 3 strands. Are two triple sprockets put together on a shaft when 6 strand chain is used or do sextuple sprockets exist and I've just not been able to find them?  \n3) Is there a way to calculate the maximum bores and hub diameters for a sprocket? I have been able to work out formulas for pitch diameter, outer diameter, and bottom diameters but I have not been able to find a formula for bores and hubs.  \nIf anyone needs the catalogs that I am referencing I can post links or dm the pdfs but most can be found when you search for them.
