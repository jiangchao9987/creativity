{"post_title": "Copycat Startups (aka The Clone Factory)", "post_main_text": "One sure-shot way to succeed in startups is by cloning successful startups.\n\nThe idea is simple. Clone an idea working in US or China and build it in your own country.\n\nIts a genius idea to make lots of money fast.\n\nThe Samwer Brothers sent several emails to eBay suggesting that the company establish an online auction platform in Germany, and that they should be hired to run it. When they didn't receive a reply, the brothers returned to Germany and, in January 1999, brought in three friends to develop their own platform, Alando.\n\nIt was a German copycat of eBay which they built it in a month. Within 100 days of going live, eBay bought them for $43 million. In 2023, eBay's revenue was $10 billion.\n\nThey cloned a lot of fastest-growing startups like:\n\n1. Zalando: Copycat version of eBay purchased by eBay for $43 million\n2. Lazada: The Amazon of Indonesia\n3. CityDeal: Groupon Clone (acquired by Groupon for $170 million only 6 months after launch)\n4. StudiVZ: Facebook Clone (sold for $100 million)\n\nThey failed a few times like with AirBnB as they couldn't compete on the community aspect but won more than enough times to make up for it.\nThe Samwer Brothers aren\u2019t the only ones who do it. Other entrepreneurs do it too. Ola in India and Didi in China comes to mind. They launched after Uber.\n\nFacebook was cloned in Russia and the founder launched VK. It is 10x bigger than Facebook in Russia.\n\nAmazon sellers clone brands that are working well. Most of the time those different competing brands are often operated by a single person sitting in China.\n\nPeleton got cloned by Echelon. Even their name is a clone.\n\nYC companies nowadays (500 startups per batch) are often clones of big startups.\nThere are clones from the YC batch too. Here's a list from few years ago:\n\n1. \u200bFancy - goPuff (raised $850m+) for the UK.\n2. \u200bMinimall - Pinduoduo for Europe\n3. \u200bSakneen - Zillow for Egypt\n4. \u200bFlat - Opendoor for Mexico\n5. \u200bDecentro - Plaid for India\n\n[Clone and Own in Latam as its targetted last by most big startups.](https://i.imgur.com/0cRZE8v.png)\n\nIn the end, you either clone consciously or subconsciously. That's How Innovation Works.\n\nWhat do you think of it? Do you hate it if someone clones your idea?
