Don't wait for motivation, learn to get disciplined and motivation will come from taking action and achieving little milestones.\n2. You can't go 0-100 in regards to being disciplined. Discipline is like a muscle. You must find your current \"strength\" and build on that.\n3. There's no such thing as waiting to find out your passion. You learn your passion by doing and figuring out what you don't like- this way you could find out what you do like.\n4. If you choose to do multiple things at once, you'll be alright in all of them.

Make time every day for your mind, body, and work... All three work together.\n9. Track everything you're doing. What's not tracked, can't grow.\n10. Things are supposed to be hard.
