I'm a  solopreneur & I happen to love talking & learning about productivity and discipline. I wanted to share a couple of things I've learned. [Here's my newsletter if you find this stuff helpful.](https://jons-growth-journal.beehiiv.com/subscribe)\n\n1. Don't wait for motivation, learn to get disciplined and motivation will come from taking action and achieving little milestones.\n2. You can't go 0-100 in regards to being disciplined. Discipline is like a muscle. You must find your current \"strength\" and build on that.\n3. There's no such thing as waiting to find out your passion. You learn your passion by doing and figuring out what you don't like- this way you could find out what you do like.\n4. If you choose to do multiple things at once, you'll be alright in all of them. Learn to  go in on one key thing at a time so you could be great at one thing. Then you will be able to diversify.\n5. Freedom is not being a slave to your desires [(learned from discipline is destiny)](https://amzn.to/3WgQoF1)\n6. You need to be able to choose hard in every aspect of life. Today everything is about being \"short\" and \"fast\"... However, most results come from taking the longer tougher route. For example, instead of watching instagram reels, spend your time reading a 300 page book, or a 1 hour long podcast.\n7. Wake up early... getting those 2-3 quiet hours in the morning is the biggest difference maker for me when it comes to getting stuff done. 2-3 hours in the morning is > than 2-3 hours when other people are up and need your attention. \n8. Make time every day for your mind, body, and work... All three work together.\n9. Track everything you're doing. What's not tracked, can't grow.\n10. Things are supposed to be hard. If it were easy, everyone would be able to do it.\n11. Re-evaluate your habits... You'll find a lot of your bad habits started when you were a teenager.
